      <title>Internodal Distance Distributions for Static and Mobile Nodes in 2D/3D Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a unified analytical framework for internodal distance distributions in 2D and 3D wireless networks, with nodes confined to concentric circular or spherical regions. Four deployment scenarios are considered, covering all combinations of static (uniform) and mobile (random waypoint-based) nodes. For each scenario, closed-form expressions for the internodal distance probability density functions are derived, incorporating both geometric constraints and spatial effects introduced by mobility. Equal-radius cases are also addressed. Beta-distribution approximations and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the accuracy and validity of the analytical results.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of Sea State and Vessel Parameters Using a Mass-Spring-Damper Equivalence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time sea state estimation is vital for applications like shipbuilding and maritime safety. Traditional methods rely on accurate wave-vessel transfer functions to estimate wave spectra from onboard sensors. In contrast, our approach jointly estimates sea state and vessel parameters without needing prior transfer function knowledge, which may be unavailable or variable. We model the wave-vessel system using pseudo mass-spring-dampers and develop a dynamic model for the system. This method allows for recursive modeling of wave excitation as a time-varying input, relaxing prior works' assumption of a constant input. We derive statistically consistent process noise covariance and implement a square root cubature Kalman filter for sensor data fusion. Further, we derive the Posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound to evaluate estimator performance. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and data from a high-fidelity validated simulator confirm that the estimated wave spectrum matches methods assuming complete transfer function knowledge.</description>

      <title>CUNEC: A Path Loss Model for Urban Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate path loss (PL) modeling is essential for evaluating and optimizing cell-free massive MIMO systems, especially in dense urban environments where traditional models fail to capture the complexity of real-world propagation. This paper introduces CUNEC (Cell-free massive MIMO for Urban Non-stationary Environments with Correlations, a novel PL model that accounts for spatial non-stationarity, inter-access point (AP)/user equipment (UE) correlations, and urban-specific propagation phenomena such as corner diffraction and street canyon waveguiding.bCUNEC segments AP-UE paths by street order, models PL as a stochastic function of urban geometry, and integrates spatially correlated shadowing. The parameters are derived from large-scale ray tracing and validated against both additional ray tracing in New York, NY and real-world channel measurements in Los Angeles, CA. Compared to the conventional alpha-beta model, CUNEC significantly improves accuracy in the considered urban propagation scenarios. An open-source dataset comprising over 30,000 AP locations and 128 UE positions is also released to support reproducible research and future system development.</description>

      <title>Bistatic Passive Tracking via CSI Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate object tracking in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) applications remains challenging due to limited signal bandwidth, sparse antenna arrays, and clock asynchronism inherent in bistatic transceiver deployments. This paper proposes PowerSense, a real-time passive tracking framework that operates directly on the power of Channel State Information (CSI). Although CSI phase carries fine-grained information, its time-varying distortions require complex processing, which introduces additional interference during tracking. Instead, this work solely relies on CSI power for accurate sensing. We first remove all CSI phase offsets through a self-conjugate operation, yielding phase-independent CSI power. A cascaded Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is then applied to extract delay, angle-of-arrival (AoA), and Doppler features, followed by object detection, outlier removal, and continuous trajectory estimation via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). To enable fine-grained motion sensing, the estimated target positions are further used to extract refined micro-Doppler signatures. Using 3.1 GHz LTE and 5 GHz WiFi bistatic signals with a 20 MHz bandwidth, our indoor experiments achieve a median tracking error of 0.4 m, without performing any pre-deployment system calibration, while simultaneously extracting clear and unambiguous micro-Doppler signatures of the tracked target.</description>

      <title>A Model and Data Dual-driven Approach for Multitargets Detection under Mainlobe Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern radar systems, target detection and parameter estimation face significant challenges when confronted with mainlobe jamming. This paper presents a Diffusion-based Model and Data Dual-driven (DMDD) approach to estimate and detect multitargets and suppress structured jamming. In DMDD, the jamming prior is modeled through a score-based diffusion process with its score learned from the pure jamming data, enabling posterior sampling without requiring detailed knowledge of jamming. Meanwhile, the target signal is usually sparse in the range space, which can be modeled via a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework, and hyperparameter is updated through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. A single diffusion process is constructed for the jamming, while the state of targets are estimated through direct posterior inference, enhancing computational efficiency. The noise variance is also estimated through EM algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in structured jamming scenarios. The proposed DMDD algorithm achieves superior target detection performance, compared with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model for Intelligent Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution toward intelligent next-generation wireless systems promises unprecedented spectral efficiency and reliability but is hindered by a paradigm of narrow and data-hungry AI models. Breaking from this constraint, this work introduces WiFo-2, a revolutionary wireless foundation model that establishes a new state of the art for extensive channel state information (CSI)-based tasks. Uniquely architected as a sparse mixture of experts, WiFo-2 effectively manages heterogeneous data and tasks while enabling highly efficient inference. It is pretrained on a massive and diverse dataset of 11.6 billion CSI points, which enables the acquisition of profound and generalizable channel knowledge. WiFo-2 demonstrates remarkable zero-shot capabilities, not only matching but surpassing the full-shot performance of task-specific baselines on unseen configurations, all while providing reliable confidence estimates. Furthermore, the model achieves exceptional performance on eight key downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. A functional hardware prototype demonstrates its real-world deployment feasibility and significant system gains, highlighting WiFo-2's superiority and paving the way for a paradigm shift in AI-based wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems-Assisted SWIPT: A Rate-Energy Trade-off Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rate-energy trade-off for pinching-antenna systems (PASS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. Both the single information user (IU)/energy user (EU) and multiple IUs/EUs scenarios are considered.1) For the single IU/EU scenario, a pinching beamforming optimization problem is formulated for simultaneously maximizing data rate and harvested energy. To tackle this problem, a two-stage algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the successive convex approximation (SCA) method is first invoked for minimizing the large-scale path loss, which is followed by the fine-tuning method for the phase alignment. 2) For the multiple IUs/EUs scenario, three multiple access schemes are considered, i.e., frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The corresponding multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) that simultaneously maximizes the minimum data rate and minimum harvested energy is formulated for ensuring users' fairness. To address this problem, we adopt the $\epsilon$-constraint method to first convert the intractable MOOPs to single-objective optimization problems (SOOPs). Then, for the SOOP under each multiple access protocol, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and convex optimization methods are adopted for solving the pinching beamforming and resource allocation problems, respectively. Simulation results unveil that: i) PASS can achieve a significantly superior rate-energy region compared to conventional fixed-position antenna systems for pinching beamforming; and ii) by exploiting the time-switching feature, TDMA can outperform both NOMA and FDMA for the multiple IUs/EUs scenario.</description>

      <title>NOMA Assisted Downlink Power Allocation in Pinching Antenna Systems Using Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a flexible-antenna architecture, referred to as a pinching-antenna (PA) system, in which multiple PAs realized by activating small dielectric particles along a dielectric waveguide are jointly employed to serve a single-antenna user. We investigate antenna placement and power allocation optimization in PA-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems using a convolutional neural network (CNN). An optimization strategy is developed to determine the PA locations that maximize achievable NOMA performance while satisfying physical and spatial constraints. The proposed method adopts a two-stage structure, combining a user-aware initialization with a gradient-based refinement, enabling near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational cost. A max-min fairness formulation is introduced for power allocation to balance the power budget among users with varying channel strengths, solved efficiently via quasi-linear programming and bisection search. Finally, a CNN-based learning framework is employed to capture the nonlinear mapping between channel conditions and the corresponding optimal power coefficients. This framework can infer near-optimal power allocations for unseen network configurations without retraining, offering scalability and adaptability. Simulation results show that the proposed CNN-based NOMA approach for PA systems improves sum rate and user fairness while reducing computational complexity.</description>

      <title>A Bio-Inspired Whisker Sensor toward Underwater Flow Sensing in Darkness and Turbidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater flow sensing is critical for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and environmental monitoring, yet existing sensors often suffer from low responsiveness, high detection thresholds, limited directional discrimination, complex packaging, and poor long-term stability, especially for navigation and target perception in turbid and cluttered waters. Previous solutions based on traditional strain gauges with limited detection accuracy or doped silicon sensors with limited detection height have shown feasibility but still face challenges in scalability, robustness under harsh aquatic conditions, and calibration complexity. This work presents a bio-inspired whisker sensor that provides a balanced solution by embedding high-gauge-factor silicon strain gauges into a flexible PDMS base, mimicking seal whiskers to offer both high sensitivity and simplified packaging. The device exhibits a linear force-resistance response with a limit of detection of 0.27 mN, maintains stability after 10,000 loading cycles, and shows minimal offset drift of less than 2 percent. It also demonstrates frequency matching in underwater dipole tests with clear longitudinal and transverse spatial response patterns. These results indicate a robust and scalable route for underwater flow sensing on UUV platforms in practical deployments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dual-Windowing Strategies for Multi-Target Detection in OFDM ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, a key challenge is balancing sidelobe attenuation and resolution for multi-target detection scenarios. While windowing functions are typically used to manage this trade-off, state-of-the-art methods rely on a single, fixed window followed by a predefined detection strategy (e.g., Binary Successive Target Cancellation (BSTC) (low complexity) or Coherent Successive Target Cancellation (CSTC) (high performance)). This paper proposes a novel dual-window periodogram-based algorithm that leverages two complementary windows: one optimized for resolution and the other for sidelobe suppression. Then, a low-complexity detection algorithm (e.g., BSTC) is applied to both, and a decision mechanism compares the outputs. When results align, the resolution-optimized estimates are directly used; otherwise, high performance algorithm (e.g., CSTC) is triggered to resolve ambiguities. This adaptive approach dynamically balances the detection performance and the complexity, addressing limitations in existing fixed strategies. The Numerical results confirm that the proposed method achieves high performance while reducing the complexity, especially at a high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>Learning to Count Targets from Dual-Window: A CNN Approach for OFDM ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms is a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. Recent studies show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can estimate the number of targets from two-dimensional (2D) range-Doppler periodogram maps, yet accuracy often degrades as scenes become denser. One significant factor is the classical resolution-sidelobe attenuation trade-off, which limits performance when targets are weak or closely spaced. While windowing is routinely applied to shape this trade-off, the choice is typically static. This paper proposes a new CNN method that uses two windowed range-Doppler periodograms and learns to fuse complementary views: one window optimized for resolution and one window optimized for sidelobe suppression. The design explicitly targets the resolution-sidelobe attenuation trade-off by exposing the model to complementary windowed maps and letting it learn when each is most informative. Numerical experiments show consistent gains over single-window CNN baselines, with better scaling in target density and greater robustness across different noise levels.</description>

      <title>Enabling Full-Duplex LEO Satellite Systems with Non-Reciprocal BD-RIS-Assisted Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite is a promising technology for providing low-latency, high-data-rate, and wide-coverage communication services. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites necessitates fast and accurate beam steering to continuously serve ground devices. While large antenna arrays can address these challenges, strict constraints on power, size, and weight make such solutions difficult to implement. Furthermore, future non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) require high spectral efficiency, which motivates the adoption of in-band full-duplex (FD) systems. {To overcome these challenges, we propose an FD LEO satellite system, where the non-reciprocal beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (NR-BD-RIS) and multiple transmit and receive antennas are attached to the LEO satellite. The NR-BD-RIS reflects the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) signals by passive beamforming.} By incorporating non-reciprocal components into the impedance network of RIS, the NR-BD-RIS breaks channel reciprocity, facilitating simultaneous support for multiple beam directions. To cover a wide coverage, we propose a time-sharing scheduling framework where, in each time slot, the NR-BD-RIS simultaneously serves multiple DL and multiple UL ground devices. An optimization problem is defined to maximize the weighted sum-rate over the entire scheduling period. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NR-BD-RIS significantly performs better than both conventional BD-RIS and diagonal RIS (D-RIS) regarding DL and UL sum-rate performance under both single-user (SU) and multiple-user (MU) cases. Additionally, the NR-BD-RIS requires less frequent reconfiguration compared to other two types of RIS, making it more practical for implementation.</description>

Abstract: We present a computationally-efficient algorithm for time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation that is robust under multipath propagation and strong interference. Our algorithm leverages multiple receive antennas to combine adaptive spatial filtering with autodifferentiation in order to super-resolve the tap of the first-arriving path at low computational complexity and without requiring model-order estimation. We use simulations with ray-traced indoor propagation channels to demonstrate significant performance improvements over conventional correlation-based ToA estimation methods and subspace techniques such as JADE.</description>

      <title>Advances in electromagnetic techniques for subsurface infrastructure detection: A comprehensive review of methods, challenges, and innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review paper explores the state-of-the-art in non-intrusive methods for detecting and characterising buried infrastructure, focusing on Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Infrared Thermography (IRT), and magnetometry, along with data fusion techniques and mathematical estimators. ERT and IRT offer distinct advantages in subsurface imaging, while magnetometry provides omnidirectional measurements ideal for detecting ferrous targets. Despite these benefits, each method has inherent limitations, such as challenges in depth estimation and difficulties in distinguishing between various subsurface objects. The integration of multiple sensing techniques through data fusion approaches has shown significant promise in overcoming these limitations and improving detection accuracy. Additionally, mathematical estimators, including Kalman filters and particle filters, play a crucial role in reducing noise and enhancing the precision of geophysical surveys. This review discusses the strengths, limitations, and future research needs of these techniques, offering a comprehensive understanding of their current and potential applications in buried infrastructure detection. The paper concludes by emphasising the importance of optimising sensor performance, refining fusion algorithms, and exploring hybrid models for real-time data processing in future research.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Signaling Design for ISAC: From Pilot-Based to Payload-Based Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for 6G networks, with signaling design at the core of its evolution. This paper reviews the paradigm shift of ISAC signaling designs from pilot-aided sensing to data payload-based approaches, with a particular focus on how these techniques can be realized within existing 5G NR structures. We commence with the reuse of pilots and reference signals that exploit existing 5G New Radio (NR) structures for sensing. Then, we extend to more advanced approaches that integrate the data payload through novel constellation shaping, modulation bases, and pulse shaping filters. We highlight the opportunities and tradeoffs that arise when extending sensing from sparse pilot and reference signal resources to the full communication frame, emphasizing how constellation properties and modulation choices directly determine sensing performance. To illustrate practical feasibility, a case study on sensing-assisted NR Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) networks demonstrates how exploiting both reference signals and payload echoes can reduce signaling overhead and enable proactive beam management and handover.</description>

      <title>FPGA-Enabled Modulo ADC with x100 Dynamic-Range Expansion: Hardware Design and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) fail to capture high-dynamic-range (HDR) signals due to clipping. Modulo ADCs circumvent this limitation by folding the input prior to quantization and algorithmically reconstructing the original waveform. This work presents a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based modulo ADC platform for systematic HDR performance evaluation. The mixed-signal architecture integrates a precision analog front end with a 200-MHz FPGA control loop that incorporates multi-bit updates and digital under-compensation calibration, ensuring stable folding and accurate feedback generation. The system achieves more than a hundred-fold dynamic-range expansion within a 400-kHz bandwidth while maintaining fidelity comparable to that of a conventional ADC. A system-on-chip (SoC)-like implementation enables on-board real-time recovery and supports benchmarking of state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, providing a compact and practical framework for HDR signal acquisition and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Moduli Selection in Robust Chinese Remainder Theorem: Closed-Form Solutions and Layered Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of \emph{moduli selection} in the Robust Chinese Remainder Theorem (RCRT), where each residue may be perturbed by a bounded error. Consider $L$ moduli of the form $m_i = \Gamma_i m$ ($1 \le i \le L$), where $\Gamma_i$ are pairwise coprime integers and $m \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is a common scaling factor. For small $L$ ($L = 2, 3, 4$), we obtain exact solutions that maximize the robustness margin under dynamic-range and modulus-bound constraints. We also introduce a Fibonacci-inspired \emph{layered} construction (for $L = 2$) that produces exactly $K$ robust decoding layers, enabling predictable trade-offs between error tolerance and dynamic range. We further analyze how robustness and range evolve across layers and provide a closed-form expression to estimate the success probability under common data and noise models. The results are promising for various applications, such as sub-Nyquist sampling, phase unwrapping, range estimation, modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and robust residue-number-system (RNS)-based accelerators for deep learning. Our framework thus establishes a general theory of moduli design for RCRT, complementing prior algorithmic work and underscoring the broad relevance of robust moduli design across diverse information-processing domains.</description>

      <title>Embodied Intelligent Wireless (EIW): Synesthesia of Machines Empowered Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution toward the sixth-generation (6G) and beyond mobile communication systems is marked by a fundamental shift from merely connecting devices to enabling pervasive and embodied intelligence. While recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication designs have achieved remarkable progress, the prevailing paradigm remains limited to static, modular AI substitutions. This approach fails to meet the core requirements of future wireless networks: the ability to continuously perceive, adapt to, and interact with the dynamic wireless environment. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Embodied Intelligent Wireless (EIW), a novel communication paradigm inspired by embodied intelligence, which redefines the communication node as an active, environment-aware, and evolving entity. EIW is built around an observation-decision-action paradigm, comprising: multi-dimensional observations for comprehensive awareness of the environment and system states, a unified decision module for orchestrating multiple wireless agents in an interpretable manner, and actions where wireless agents exert practical effects on both the environment and communication systems. Furthermore, two enabling technologies, wireless world models as well as self-update and self-evolution mechanisms, are introduced to support training efficiency improvement, counterfactual evaluation, and better adaptation. Unlike existing communication systems, EIW envisions future communication systems not as passive data pipelines, but as intelligent entities that continuously interact with and co-evolve alongside their environments. Finally, through simulations, we showcase the advantages of the proposed EIW paradigm and its enabling techniques in shaping the design of wireless communication nodes.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Physical Layer Security: Artificial Noise-Driven Optimization and Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a key enabler for providing signal coverage, energy efficiency, reliable communication, and physical layer security (PLS) in next-generation wireless communication networks. This paper investigates an artificial noise (AN)-driven RIS-assisted secure communication system. The RIS is partitioned into two segments, where the first segment is configured to direct the communication signal (CS) toward the legitimate user (Bob), and the other one is configured to steer the AN toward the eavesdropper (Eve). To this end, iterative and discrete Fourier transform-based algorithms are developed for practical RIS phase shift optimization. The power allocation between the CS and the AN signals is optimized in such a way that the secrecy capacity (SC) is maximized while limiting Eve's channel capacity. The proposed PLS framework is evaluated through both simulations and software defined radio based testbed experiments. The results demonstrate promising improvements in the SC, highlighting the potential of AN-driven RIS-assisted PLS for practical deployments.</description>

      <title>RAG-Empowered LLM-Driven Dynamic Radio Resource Management in Open 6G RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implications of the advancements in the area of artificial intelligence to the wireless communications is extremely significant, especially in terms of resource management. In this paper, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered Large Language Model (ReLLM)-driven dynamic radio resource management framework for Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) inspired 6G networks is proposed. The introduced methodology leverages the ReLLM framework to interpret both historical and real-time network data, enabling adaptive control of network slices. The ReLLM is founded on two specialized agents, one is responsible for proactively detecting service level agreement (SLA) violations by continuously monitoring and estimating slice-specific performance metrics, and the other one is responsible for dynamically reallocating physical resource blocks when the SLA violation probability exceeds a pre-defined threshold. The primary objective of this dual-agent design is to minimize unnecessary LLM inference calls while satisfying the SLA requirements of the slices, thereby improving computational and energy efficiency. The proposed ReLLM framework is implemented and validated on an end-to-end O-RAN testbed built upon open-source OpenAirInterface emulators. The experimental results demonstrate that the LLM approach with its reduced token consumption feature maintains a near-zero drop ratio for the low-priority slice while simultaneously satisfying acceptable latency performance for the high-priority slice. The ReLLM-driven design improves reliability and SLA compliance, confirming its practicality for real-world O-RAN testbeds and its potential applicability to future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>DoA Estimation with Sparse Arrays: Effects of Antenna Element Patterns and Nonidealities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the effects of directional antenna element complex gain patterns and nonidealities in direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. We compare sparse arrays and classical uniform linear arrays, harnessing EM simulation tools to accurately model the electromagnetic behavior of both patch and Vivaldi antenna element including mutual coupling effects. We show that with sparse array configurations, the performance impacts are significant in terms of DoA estimation accuracy and operable SNR ranges. Specifically, in the scenarios considered, both the usage of directional antenna elements and a sparse array result in over 90% reduction in average direction finding error, compared to a uniform omnidirectional array with the same number of elements (in this case eight), when estimating the directions of two sources using the MUSIC algorithm. For a fixed angular RMSE, the improvements in array sensitivity are shown to yield a 4 to 15-fold increase in one-way coverage distance (assuming free-space path loss). Among the studied options, the best performance was obtained using sparse arrays with either patch or Vivaldi elements for field of views of 100$^\circ$ or 120$^\circ$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Chaotic Signals for Wireless Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems have attracted considerable attention due to their inherent randomness and high sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes them ideal for secure wireless communications. Beyond security, these same characteristics also make chaotic signals particularly effective for wireless power transfer (WPT) applications. On the other hand, connectivity along with self-sustainability are the two cornerstones of the upcoming sixth generation (6G) standard for radio communications. Consequently, with the massive increase in wireless devices and sensors, the concept of self-sustainable wireless networks is becoming more relevant. The aspect of WPT to the widely spread wireless devices and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) among these devices will play a crucial role in the 6G communication systems. In this context, it has been experimentally observed that chaotic signals result in better WPT performance as compared to the existing benchmark schemes. Hence, in this paper, we characterize the generalized WPT performance of the multi-dimensional chaotic signals and present the use case of the Lorenz and the Henon chaotic systems. Moreover, we provide a novel differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)-based WPT receiver architecture ideal for enhanced energy harvesting (EH). Furthermore, we propose DCSK-based transmit waveform designs for multi-antenna SWIPT architectures and investigate the impact of the rate-energy trade-off. Our goal is to explore these aspects of the chaotic signals and discuss their relevance in the context of both WPT and SWIPT.</description>

      <title>What If They Took the Shot? A Hierarchical Bayesian Framework for Counterfactual Expected Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a hierarchical Bayesian framework that integrates expert domain knowledge to quantify player-specific effects in expected goals (xG) estimation, addressing a limitation of standard models that treat all players as identical finishers. Using 9,970 shots from StatsBomb's 2015-16 data and Football Manager 2017 ratings, we combine Bayesian logistic regression with informed priors to stabilise player-level estimates, especially for players with few shots. The hierarchical model reduces posterior uncertainty relative to weak priors and achieves strong external validity: hierarchical and baseline predictions correlate at R2 = 0.75, while an XGBoost benchmark validated against StatsBomb xG reaches R2 = 0.833. The model uncovers interpretable specialisation profiles, including one-on-one finishing (Aguero, Suarez, Belotti, Immobile, Martial), long-range shooting (Pogba), and first-touch execution (Insigne, Salah, Gameiro). It also identifies latent ability in underperforming players such as Immobile and Belotti. The framework supports counterfactual "what-if" analysis by reallocating shots between players under identical contexts. Case studies show that Sansone would generate +2.2 xG from Berardi's chances, driven largely by high-pressure situations, while Vardy-Giroud substitutions reveal strong asymmetry: replacing Vardy with Giroud results in a large decline (about -7 xG), whereas the reverse substitution has only a small effect (about -1 xG). This work provides an uncertainty-aware tool for player evaluation, recruitment, and tactical planning, and offers a general approach for domains where individual skill and contextual factors jointly shape performance.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security with Artificial Noise in MIMO Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As next-generation wireless networks emerge, security is becoming a critical performance metric. However, conventional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems often suffer from severe path loss and are vulnerable to nearby eavesdroppers due to their fixed-antenna configurations. Pinching-antenna systems (PASs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging reconfigurable pinching antennas (PAs) positioned along low-loss dielectric waveguides to enhance channel conditions and dynamically mitigate security threats. In this paper, we propose an artificial noise (AN)-aided beamforming framework for the PAS downlink that maximizes the secrecy rate (SR) by jointly optimizing the information beams, the AN covariance, and the PA positions. We examine both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) for the eavesdropper's channel. For the latter, location errors are mapped via a Jacobian into an ellipsoidal channel uncertainty set to accurately formulate the problem. We derive a closed-form solution for the single-waveguide scenario, yielding the optimal PA location and an information/AN power-splitting rule. For multiple waveguides and users, we develop a deep neural network (DNN)-aided joint optimizer that outputs beams, AN, and PA placements. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves SR consistently over PAS baselines in single- and multi-user settings under both perfect and imperfect CSI.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Pilot Length, Pilot Assignment, and Power Allocation for Cell-free MIMO Systems with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In user-centric cell-free multi-antenna systems, pilot contamination degrades spectral efficiency (SE) severely. To mitigate pilot contamination, existing works jointly optimize pilot assignment and power allocation by assuming fixed pilot length, which fail to balance pilot overhead against the contamination. To maximize net-SE, we jointly optimize pilot length, pilot assignment, and power allocation with deep learning. Since the pilot length is a variable, the size of pilot assignment matrix is unknown during the optimization. To cope with the challenge, we design size-generalizable graph neural networks (GNNs). We prove that pilot assignment policy is a one-to-many mapping, and improperly designed GNNs cannot learn the optimal policy. We tackle this issue by introducing feature enhancement. To improve learning performance, we design a contamination-aware attention mechanism for the GNNs. Given that pilot assignment and power allocation respectively depend on large- and small-scale channels, we develop a dual-timescale GNN framework to explore the potential. To reduce inference time, a single-timescale GNN is also designed. Simulation results show that the designed GNNs outperform existing methods in terms of net-SE, training complexity, and inference time, and can be well generalized across problem scales and channels.</description>

      <title>Strategies to Minimize Out-of-Distribution Effects in Data-Driven MRS Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically compared data-driven and model-based strategies for metabolite quantification in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), focusing on resilience to out-of-distribution (OoD) effects and the balance between accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. A neural network designed for MRS quantification was trained using three distinct strategies: supervised regression, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation. These were compared against model-based fitting tools. Experiments combined large-scale simulated data, designed to probe metabolite concentration extrapolation and signal variability, with 1H single-voxel 7T in-vivo human brain spectra. In simulations, supervised learning achieved high accuracy for spectra similar to those in the training distribution, but showed marked degradation when extrapolated beyond the training distribution. Test-time adaptation proved more resilient to OoD effects, while self-supervised learning achieved intermediate performance. In-vivo experiments showed larger variance across the methods (data-driven and model-based) due to domain shift. Across all strategies, overlapping metabolites and baseline variability remained persistent challenges. While strong performance can be achieved by data-driven methods for MRS metabolite quantification, their reliability is contingent on careful consideration of the training distribution and potential OoD effects. When such conditions in the target distribution cannot be anticipated, test-time adaptation strategies ensure consistency between the quantification, the data, and the model, enabling reliable data-driven MRS pipelines.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Motor Condition Monitoring with Time Series Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor condition monitoring is essential for ensuring system reliability and preventing catastrophic failures. However, data-driven diagnostic methods often suffer from sparse fault labels and severe class imbalance, which limit their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a motor condition monitoring framework that leverages the general features learned during pre-training of two time series foundation models, MOMENT and Mantis, to address these challenges. By transferring broad temporal representations from large-scale pre-training, the proposed approach significantly reduces dependence on labeled data while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that MOMENT achieves nearly twice the performance of conventional deep learning models using only 1\% of the training data, whereas Mantis surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by 22\%, reaching 90\% accuracy with the same data ratio. These results demonstrate the strong generalization and data efficiency of time series foundation models in fault diagnosis, providing new insights into scalable and adaptive frameworks for intelligent motor condition monitoring.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Estimation and Joint Angle-Range Recovery in XL-MIMO Systems: A Gridless Super-Resolution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing near-field channel estimation methods for extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) typically discretize angle and range parameters jointly, resulting in large polar-domain codebooks. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates near-field channel estimation as a gridless super-resolution problem, eliminating the need for explicitly constructed codebooks. By employing a second-order approximation of spherical-wave steering vectors, the near-field channel is represented as a superposition of complex exponentials modulated by unknown waveforms. We demonstrate that these waveforms lie tightly in a common discrete chirp rate (DCR) subspace, with a dimension that scales as $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ for an $N$-element array. By leveraging this structure and applying a lifting technique, we reformulate the non-convex problem as a convex program using regularized atomic norm minimization, which admits an equivalent semidefinite program. From the solution to the convex program, we obtain gridless angle estimates and derive closed-form coarse range estimates, followed by refinement under the exact spherical model using gradient-based nonlinear least squares. The proposed method avoids basis mismatch and exhaustive two-dimensional grid searches while enabling accurate joint angle-range estimation with pilot budgets that scale sublinearly with array size in sparse multipath regimes. Simulations demonstrate accurate channel reconstruction and user localization across representative near-field scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Statistical Geometric Channel Model for ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for a geometry-based statistical model for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) tailored for bistatic systems. Our dual-component model decomposes the ISAC channel into a target channel encompassing all multipath components produced by a sensing target parameterized by the target's radar cross-section and scattering points, and a background channel comprising all other propagation paths that do not interact with the sensing target. The framework extends TR38.901 via a hybrid clustering approach, integrating spatiotemporally consistent deterministic clusters with stochastic clusters to preserve channel reciprocity and absolute delay alignment for sensing parameter estimation. Extensive simulations across urban macro, urban micro, and indoor factory scenarios demonstrate that the model maintains communication performance parity with the standard TR38.901, validated through bit-error rate analysis obtained via simulated and measured ISAC channels and channel capacity assessment, while enabling sensing performance evaluation, such as target ranging error for localization and receiver operating characteristic curves for detection probability.</description>

      <title>Robust HRRP Recognition under Interrupted Sampling Repeater Jamming using a Prior Jamming Information-Guided Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar automatic target recognition (RATR) based on high-resolution range profile (HRRP) has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to capture fine-grained structural features. However, recognizing targets under electronic countermeasures (ECM), especially the mainstream interrupted-sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ), remains a significant challenge, as HRRPs often suffer from serious feature distortion. To address this, we propose a robust HRRP recognition method guided by prior jamming information. Specifically, we introduce a point spread function (PSF) as prior information to model the HRRP distortion induced by ISRJ. Based on this, we design a recognition network that leverages this prior through a prior-guided feature interaction module and a hybrid loss function to enhance the model's discriminative capability. With the aid of prior information, the model can learn invariant features within distorted HRRP under different jamming parameters. Both the simulated and measured-data experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits stronger generalization capabilities when facing unseen jamming parameters.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Feature Integration for Multi-Signal Automatic Modulation Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is a crucial step in wireless communication systems, which identifies the modulation scheme from detected signals to provide key information for further processing. However, previous work has mainly focused on the identification of a single signal, overlooking the phenomenon of multiple signal superposition in practical channels and the signal detection procedures that must be conducted beforehand. Considering the susceptibility of radio frequency (RF) signals to noise interference and significant spectral variations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Feature Integration (HIFI)-YOLO framework for multi-signal joint detection and modulation recognition. Our HIFI-YOLO framework, with its unique design of hierarchical feature integration, effectively enhances the representation capability of features in different modules, thereby improving detection performance. We construct a large-scale AMR dataset specifically tailored for scenarios of the coexistence or overlapping of multiple signals transmitted through channels with realistic propagation conditions, consisting of diverse digital and analog modulation schemes. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of HIFI-YOLO in multi-signal detection and modulation recognition as a joint approach.</description>

      <title>Compensation of correlated autoregressive clock jitter in arrays of Analog-to-Digital Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern communication systems, the fidelity of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is limited by sampling clock jitter, i.e., small random timing deviations that undermine ideal sampling. Traditional scalar models often treat jitter as independent Gaussian noise, which makes it essentially untrackable, whereas real ADCs also exhibit temporally correlated (spectrally colored) imperfections. Moreover, spatial cross-correlations between channels in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ADCs are commonly neglected. This paper addresses the joint tracking and compensation of random, cross-correlated timing errors in ADC arrays by modeling jitter as a coupled vector autoregressive process of order one (VAR(1)). We propose a pilot-tone-based Kalman smoother to track and compensate the jitter, and simulations demonstrate substantial reductions in jitter-induced distortion across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>EMF-Compliant Power Control in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Model-Based and Data-Driven Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impressive growth of wireless data networks has recently led to increased attention to the issue of electromagnetic pollution and the fulfillment of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure limits. This paper tackles the problem of power control in user-centric cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems under EMF constraints. Specifically, the power allocation maximizing the minimum data rate across users is derived for both the uplink and the downlink. To solve such optimization problems, two approaches are proposed, i.e., model-based and data-driven. The proposed model-based solutions for the downlink utilize successive convex optimization and the log-sum-exp approximation for the minimum of a discrete set, whereas ordinary techniques are employed for the uplink. With regard to data-driven solutions, solutions based on both end-to-end architectures and deep unfolding techniques are explored. Extensive numerical results confirm that the proposed model-based solutions effectively fulfill the EMF constraints while ensuring very good performance; moreover, the results show that the proposed data-driven approaches can tightly approximate the performance of model-based solutions but with much lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Effective Hyper-clutter Artifacts Suppression for Ultrafast Ultrasound Doppler Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Hyper-clutter artifacts (HCA), arising from strong tissue reflections or physiological motion, present persistent challenges in ultrafast ultrasound Doppler imaging, often obscuring surrounding small vessel flow signals, especially in fascial regions such as the renal capsule. This study proposes U-profile-based decluttering (UPBD), a robust and computationally efficient method that exploits singular value decomposition (SVD)-derived spatial singular vectors to suppress HCA in ultrafast Doppler imaging. Methods: UPBD analyzes intensity profile of each pixel along the singular-order dimension of the SVD-derived left singular vectors U. A pixel-wise clutter-energy ratio is computed to derive a spatially adaptive declutter weighting map, which is applied to the SVD-filtered flow signals. Results: UPBD was evaluated on multiple in vivo datasets. Quantitative assessments based on contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and contrast-to-tissue ratio (CTR) demonstrated significant improvements over conventional SVD filtering. For example, UPBD enhanced CTR from 7.3 dB to 21.7 dB in contrast-free pig kidney, 17.8 dB to 42.1 dB in contrast-enhanced pig kidney, 8.2 dB to 32.8 dB in human kidney, and -4.9 dB to 3.7 dB in 3D human liver. Conclusion: The proposed UPBD method effectively suppresses HCA while preserving blood flow signals with minimal extra computational cost and no need for extensive parameter tuning. Significance: UPBD serves as a lightweight, easily integrated post-processing method that enhances HCA suppression, enabling broader application of SVD-based ultrafast Doppler imaging.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Architectures for Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (C-VEPs) require highly robust decoding methods to address temporal variability and session-dependent noise in EEG signals. This study proposes and evaluates several deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 63-bit m-sequence reconstruction and classification, and Siamese networks for similarity-based decoding, alongside canonical correlation analysis (CCA) baselines. EEG data were recorded from 13 healthy adults under single-target flicker stimulation. The proposed deep models significantly outperformed traditional approaches, with distance-based decoding using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and constrained EMD showing greater robustness to latency variations than Euclidean and Mahalanobis metrics. Temporal data augmentation with small shifts further improved generalization across sessions. Among all models, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the best overall performance with an average accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating the potential of data-driven deep architectures for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems.</description>

      <title>MOTIF-RF: Multi-template On-chip Transformer Synthesis Incorporating Frequency-domain Self-transfer Learning for RFIC Design Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on developing multi-template machine learning (ML) surrogate models and applying them to the inverse design of transformers (XFMRs) in radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs). Our study starts with benchmarking four widely used ML architectures, including MLP-, CNN-, UNet-, and GT-based models, using the same datasets across different XFMR topologies. To improve modeling accuracy beyond these baselines, we then propose a new frequency-domain self-transfer learning technique that exploits correlations between adjacent frequency bands, leading to around 30%-50% accuracy improvement in the S-parameters prediction. Building on these models, we further develop an inverse design framework based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. This framework is validated using multiple impedance-matching tasks, all demonstrating fast convergence and trustworthy performance. These results advance the goal of AI-assisted specs-to-GDS automation for RFICs and provide RFIC designers with actionable tools for integrating AI into their workflows.</description>

      <title>Digital Elevation Model Estimation from RGB Satellite Imagery using Generative Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are vital datasets for geospatial applications such as hydrological modeling and environmental monitoring. However, conventional methods to generate DEM, such as using LiDAR and photogrammetry, require specific types of data that are often inaccessible in resource-constrained settings. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes an approach to generate DEM from freely available RGB satellite imagery using generative deep learning, particularly based on a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We first developed a global dataset consisting of 12K RGB-DEM pairs using Landsat satellite imagery and NASA's SRTM digital elevation data, both from the year 2000. A unique preprocessing pipeline was implemented to select high-quality, cloud-free regions and aggregate normalized RGB composites from Landsat imagery. Additionally, the model was trained in a two-stage process, where it was first trained on the complete dataset and then fine-tuned on high-quality samples filtered by Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values to improve performance on challenging terrains. The results demonstrate promising performance in mountainous regions, achieving an overall mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.4671 and a mean SSIM score of 0.2065 (scale -1 to 1), while highlighting limitations in lowland and residential areas. This study underscores the importance of meticulous preprocessing and iterative refinement in generative modeling for DEM generation, offering a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to conventional methods while emphasizing the challenge of generalization across diverse terrains worldwide.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Kalman Filter and Smoother for Benchmark Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose analytical mean square error (MSE) expressions for the Kalman filter (KF) and the Kalman smoother (KS) for benchmark studies, where the true system dynamics are unknown or unavailable to the estimator. In such cases, as in benchmark evaluations for target tracking, the analysis relies on deterministic state trajectories. This setting introduces a model mismatch between the estimator and the system, causing the covariance estimates to no longer reflect the actual estimation errors. To enable accurate performance prediction for fixed state trajectories without relying on computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations, we derive recursive MSE expressions with linear time complexity. The proposed framework also accounts for measurement model mismatch and provides an efficient tool for performance evaluation in benchmark studies with long trajectories. Simulation results confirm the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

In this work, we apply density-based neural TPPs to model heartbeat dynamics from 18 subjects. We adapt a goodness-of-fit framework from classical point process literature to Neural TPPs and use it to optimize hyperparameters, identify appropriate training sequence lengths to capture temporal dependencies, and demonstrate zero-shot predictive capability on heartbeat data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have positioned them as powerful generative frameworks for speech synthesis, demonstrating substantial improvements in audio quality and stability. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in vocoders conditioned on mel spectrograms remains constrained, particularly when the conditioning diverges from the training distribution. The recently proposed GLA-Grad model introduced a phase-aware extension to the WaveGrad vocoder that integrated the Griffin-Lim algorithm (GLA) into the reverse process to reduce inconsistencies between generated signals and conditioning mel spectrogram. In this paper, we further improve GLA-Grad through an innovative choice in how to apply the correction. Particularly, we compute the correction term only once, with a single application of GLA, to accelerate the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the baseline models, particularly in out-of-domain scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic systems necessitate extensive data transmission between room-temperature and cryogenic environments, as well as within the cryogenic temperature domain. High-speed, low-power data transmission is pivotal to enabling the deployment of larger-scale cryogenic systems, including the scalable quantum computing systems and the high-performance cryogenic computing systems fully immersed in liquid nitrogen. In contrast to wireline and microwave links, optical communication links are emerging as a solution characterized by high data rates, high energy efficiency, low signal attenuation, absence of thermal conduction, and superior scalability. In this work, a 4K heat-insulated high-speed (56Gbps) low-power (1.6pJ/b) transceiver (TRX) that achieves a complete link between 4K systems and room temperature (RT) equipment is presented. Copackaged with a PIN photodiode (PD), the RX uses an inverter-based analog front-end and an analog half-rate clock data recovery loop. Connecting to a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), the TX contains a voltage-mode driver with current-mode injection for low-power output-swing-boosting and 3-tap feed-forward equalization (FFE). This link has been demonstrated in the control and readout of a complete superconducting quantum computing system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional and modern machine learning-based path loss models typically assume a constant prediction variance. We propose a neural network that jointly predicts the mean and link-specific variance by minimizing a Gaussian negative log-likelihood, enabling heteroscedastic uncertainty estimates. We compare shared, partially shared, and independent-parameter architectures using accuracy, calibration, and sharpness metrics on blind test sets from large public RF drive-test datasets. The shared-parameter architecture performs best, achieving an RMSE of 7.4 dB, 95.1 percent coverage for 95 percent prediction intervals, and a mean interval width of 29.6 dB. These uncertainty estimates further support link-specific coverage margins, improve RF planning and interference analyses, and provide effective self-diagnostics of model weaknesses.</description>

      <title>Distributed Dynamic Associative Memory via Online Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and it has recently been recognized as a key mechanism underlying modern neural architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDAM-TOGD framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to representative online learning baselines such as consensus-based distributed optimization, confirming the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic, distributed environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication With Degree Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how quantum resources can be used to increase the rate of private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM). In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$.
  First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting.
  Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied.</description>

      <title>Integrating Semantic Communication and Human Decision-Making into an End-to-End Sensing-Decision Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As early as 1949, Weaver defined communication in a very broad sense to include all procedures by which one mind or technical system can influence another, thus establishing the idea of semantic communication. With the recent success of machine learning in expert assistance systems where sensed information is wirelessly provided to a human to assist task execution, the need to design effective and efficient communications has become increasingly apparent. In particular, semantic communication aims to convey the meaning behind the sensed information relevant for Human Decision-Making (HDM). Regarding the interplay between semantic communication and HDM, many questions remain, such as how to model the entire end-to-end sensing-decision-making process, how to design semantic communication for the HDM and which information should be provided for HDM. To address these questions, we propose to integrate semantic communication and HDM into one probabilistic end-to-end sensing-decision framework that bridges communications and psychology. In our interdisciplinary framework, we model the human through a HDM process, allowing us to explore how feature extraction from semantic communication can best support HDM both in theory and in simulations. In this sense, our study reveals the fundamental design trade-off between maximizing the relevant semantic information and matching the cognitive capabilities of the HDM model. Our initial analysis shows how semantic communication can balance the level of detail with human cognitive capabilities while demanding less bandwidth, power, and latency.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Subarray Segmentation: A New Paradigm of Spatial Non-Stationary Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04211v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the complexities of spatial non-stationary (SnS) effects and spherical wave propagation in near-field channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, this paper proposes an SnS-aware CE framework based on adaptive subarray partitioning. We first investigate spherical wave propagation and various SnS characteristics and construct an SnS near-field channel model for XL-MIMO systems. Due to the limitations of uniform array partitioning in capturing SnS, we analyze the adverse effects of the non-ideal array segmentation (over- and under-segmentation) on CE accuracy. To counter these issues, we develop a dynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm (DHBF-PSSP), which integrates power measurements with a dynamic hybrid beamforming structure to enable joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A power-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS) algorithm leverages the statistical properties of power profiles, while subarray decoupling is achieved via a subarray segmentation-based sampling method (SS-SM) under radio frequency (RF) chain constraints. For subarray CE, we propose a subarray segmentation-based assorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple measurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV). This algorithm exploits angular-domain block sparsity under a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook and inter-subcarrier structured sparsity. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in CE performance.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted mmWave Systems via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications. However, the performance of RIS-assisted systems critically depends on accurate channel state information (CSI). To address this challenge, this letter proposes a novel channel estimation method for RIS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems based on diffusion models (DMs). Specifically, the forward diffusion process of the original signal is formulated to model the received signal as a noisy observation within the framework of DMs. Subsequently, the channel estimation task is formulated as the reverse diffusion process, and a sampling algorithm based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) is developed to enable effective inference. Furthermore, a lightweight neural network, termed BRCNet, is introduced to replace the conventional U-Net, significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity. Extensive experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines.</description>

      <title>WaveC2R: Wavelet-Driven Coarse-to-Refined Hierarchical Learning for Radar Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite-based radar retrieval methods are widely employed to fill coverage gaps in ground-based radar systems, especially in remote areas affected by terrain blockage and limited detection range. Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries.</description>

      <title>Group-wise Semantic Splitting Multiple Access for Multi-User Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a group-wise semantic splitting multiple access framework for multi-user semantic communication in downlink scenarios. The framework begins by applying a balanced clustering mechanism that groups users based on the similarity of their semantic characteristics, enabling the extraction of group-level common features and user-specific private features. The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.26x performance improvement over conventional schemes across various channel conditions, validating its robustness and semantic efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) has been employed as a spectral feature extractor for acoustic recognition tasks in conjunction with machine learning and deep learning models. However, applying the CWT to each individual audio sample is computationally intensive. This paper proposes an approach that applies the CWT to a subset of samples, spaced according to a specified hop size. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining the robust performance of the trained models.</description>

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised variational acoustic clustering model for clustering audio data in the time-frequency domain.

      <title>Axial-UNet: A Neural Weather Model for Precipitation Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting short-term precipitation is critical for weather-sensitive applications such as disaster management, aviation, and urban planning. Traditional numerical weather prediction can be computationally intensive at high resolution and short lead times. In this work, we propose a lightweight UNet-based encoder-decoder augmented with axial-attention blocks that attend along image rows and columns to capture long-range spatial interactions, while temporal context is provided by conditioning on multiple past radar frames. Our hybrid architecture captures both local and long-range spatio-temporal dependencies from radar image sequences, enabling fixed lead-time precipitation nowcasting with modest compute. Experimental results on a preprocessed subset of the HKO-7 radar dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms ConvLSTM, pix2pix-style cGANs, and a plain UNet in pixel-fidelity metrics, reaching PSNR 47.67 and SSIM 0.9943. We report PSNR/SSIM here; extending evaluation to meteorology-oriented skill measures (e.g., CSI/FSS) is left to future work. The approach is simple, scalable, and effective for resource-constrained, real-time forecasting scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Manifold-Aware Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning for Noise-Robust Biosignal Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning robust representations for physiological time-series signals continues to pose a substantial challenge in developing efficient few-shot learning applications. This difficulty is largely due to the complex pathological variations in biosignals. In this context, this paper introduces a manifold-aware Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL) framework, which efficiently leverages the generative structure of latent diffusion models with the discriminative power of supervised contrastive learning. The proposed framework operates within a contextualized scattering latent space derived from Scattering Transformer (ST) features. Within a contrastive learning framework, we employ a forward diffusion process in the scattering latent space as a structured manifold-aware feature augmentation technique. We assessed the proposed framework using the PhysioNet 2017 ECG benchmark dataset. The proposed method achieved a competitive AUROC of 0.9741 in the task of detecting atrial fibrillation from a single-lead ECG signal. The proposed framework achieved performance on par with relevant state-of-the-art related works. In-depth evaluation findings suggest that early-stage diffusion serves as an ideal "local manifold explorer," producing embeddings with greater precision than typical augmentation methods while preserving inference efficiency.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Large Language Model Inference via Resource-Aware Parallel Speculative Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01695v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference highlights the need for efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) solutions, especially in resource-constrained settings. Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method achieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency without compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM services in MEC systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in mmWave radar technologies have enabled the truly non-contact heart-rate (HR) and breath-rate (BR) measurement approaches, which provides a great ease in patient monitoring. Additionally, these technologies also provide opportunities to simultaneously detect HR and BR of multiple patients, which has become increasingly important for efficient mass monitoring scenarios. In this work, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) mmWave radar based truly non-contact multiple patient HR and BR monitoring system has been presented. Furthermore, a novel approach is also proposed, which combines multiple processing methods using a least squares solution to improve measurement accuracy, generalization, and handle measurement error. The proposed system has been developed using Texas Instruments' FMCW radar and experimental results with multiple subjects are also presented, which show &gt;97% and &gt;93% accuracy in the measured BR and HR values, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multisubject Vital Sign Monitoring With mmWave FMCW Radar and FPGA Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to estimate the vital signs of multiple human subjects simultaneously in a non-contact way using a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar-based system. Traditional vital sign monitoring methods often face significant limitations, including subject discomfort with wearable devices, challenges in calibration, and the risk of infection transmission through contact measurement devices. To address these issues, this research is motivated by the need for versatile, non-contact vital monitoring solutions applicable in various critical scenarios. This work also explores the challenges of extending this capability to an arbitrary number of subjects, including hardware and theoretical limitations. Supported by rigorous experimental results and discussions, the paper illustrates the system's potential to redefine vital sign monitoring. An FPGA-based implementation is also presented as proof of concept for a hardware-based and portable solution, improving upon previous works by offering 2.7x faster execution and 18.4% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, as well as providing over 7400x acceleration compared to its software counterpart.</description>
