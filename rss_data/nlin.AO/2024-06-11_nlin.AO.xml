      <title>Revisiting institutional punishment in the $N$-person prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conflict between individual and collective interests makes fostering cooperation in human societies a challenging task, requiring drastic measures such as the establishment of sanctioning institutions. These institutions are costly because they have to be maintained regardless of the presence or absence of offenders. Here, we propose realistic improvements to the standard $N$-person prisoner's dilemma formulation with institutional punishment by eliminating overpunishment, requiring a minimum number of contributors to establish the sanctioning institution, and sharing the cost among them once this minimum number is reached. In addition, we focus on large groups or communities for which sanctioning institutions are ubiquitous. Using the replicator equation framework for an infinite population, we find that by sufficiently fining players who fail to contribute either to the public good or to the sanctioning institution, a population of contributors immune to invasion by these free riders can be established, provided that the contributors are sufficiently numerous. In a finite population, we use finite-size scaling to show that, for some parameter settings, demographic noise helps to fixate the strategy that contributes to the public good but not to the sanctioning institution even for infinitely large populations when, somewhat counterintuitively, its proportion in the initial population vanishes with a small power of the population size.</description>

      <title>Quantifying dissipation in stochastic complex oscillations</title>

Abstract: Fluctuations-driven complex oscillations are experimentally observed in cellular systems such as hepatocytes, cardiac cells, neuronal cells, etc. These systems are generally operating in regimes far from thermodynamic equilibrium. To study nonequilibrium thermodynamic properties such as energy dissipation in stochastic complex oscillations, we consider stochastic modeling of two nonlinear biological oscillators, namely, the intracellular calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) oscillation model and the Hindmarsh-Rose model for neuronal dynamics. These models exhibit various types of complex oscillations like bursting and quasi-periodic oscillations for various system parameter values. In this work, we formulate open chemical reaction schemes for the two model systems driving the systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. We then analyze the steady-state total entropy production rate (EPR) in the various types of stochastic complex oscillations. Our results show higher values of steady-state total EPR in stochastic complex oscillations than simple periodic oscillations. Moreover, in the Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal model, we observe an order-to-disorder transition from periodic (organized) bursts of spikes to chaotic (unorganized) oscillations with distinct behaviors of steady-state total EPR. Our results reveal that stochastic complex oscillations are produced at the cost of higher energy consumption and that it requires a higher thermodynamic cost to maintain the periodic bursts than chaotic oscillations. Our findings indicate that complex cellular regulatory or signaling processes by Ca$^{2+}$ that help perform complex tasks of the nervous system or rich information coding by neurons involve a higher thermodynamic cost. The results deepen our understanding of energy dissipation in nonlinear, nonequilibrium biological systems with stochastic complex oscillatory dynamics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Approximation of Fading Mode in Neurooscillator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of two delay differential equations with a large parameter, modeling the association of a pair of neurooscillators. The unknown functions describe the changes in the normalized membrane potentials of neurons over time, with the large parameter characterizing the speed of electrical processes. The first equation is separated from the system and represents a generalized Hutchinson equation. This equation, as known, possesses periodic solutions with high peaks over the period. The second equation is also based on the generalized Hutchinson equation, but with an additional term, linking it to an oscillator satisfying the first equation. For the second equation, it is possible to asymptotically construct the so-called fading neuron mode, which is as follows: for any natural number $n$, one can adjust the parameters of the problem in such a way that the solution is asymptotically close to a periodic function with high peaks over $n$ periods, and then, after a transient process represented by decreasing peaks, becomes asymptotically small.</description>

      <title>Phase reduction explains chimera shape: when multi-body interaction matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for networks, deriving the second-order phase approximation for a paradigmatic model of oscillatory networks - an ensemble of non-identical Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled pairwisely via an arbitrary coupling matrix. We explicitly demonstrate how this matrix translates into the coupling structure in the phase equations. To illustrate the power of our approach and the crucial importance of high-order phase reduction, we tackle a trendy setup of non-locally coupled oscillators exhibiting a chimera state. We reveal that our second-order phase model reproduces the dependence of the chimera shape on the coupling strength that is not captured by the typically used first-order Kuramoto-like model. Our derivation contributes to a better understanding of complex networks' dynamics, establishing a relation between the coupling matrix and multi-body interaction terms in the high-order phase model.</description>
