      <title>From Ponzi Schemes to Benign Investment Dynamics: modelling Collapse, Stability, and a Path to Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population and capital dynamics of three stylized investment systems are mathematically described using discrete-time difference equations with closed-form solutions. The models share a common capital budget equation but differ in their demographic laws, which are geometric, quasi-logistic, or epidemiologic (SIR-based). The quasi-logistic model is designed as an analytically tractable non-Ponzi investment system: it generalizes the geometric model (and, in the limit of a constant growth rate, reproduces classical Ponzi dynamics) while closely mirroring the behaviour of an SIR-based model with decreasing effective growth. In all cases, promised returns are modeled as fixed per-period payouts on initial investment with principal repaid upon exit, so that aggregate liabilities depend only on the current number of active investors. Within this unified framework, classical Ponzi schemes arise as special cases that inevitably collapse, while suitable parameter choices in the quasi-logistic and SIR-based versions generate finite-horizon, legally benign "no-Ponzi game" investment schemes with analytically transparent conditions for collapse, stability, and sustained operation.</description>

      <title>Matrices with integer eigenvalues for all permutations of coefficients (thanks to Pythagoras!)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that Pythagorean triples can be used to generate matrices that have integer eigenvalues for all permutations of their coefficients, via simple formulas. For example, each and every permutation of the $2\times2$ matrix coefficients $\{12,6,7,1\}$, generated by the Pythagorean triple $(5,12,13)$, yields a matrix with integer eigenvalues. Further, each and every Pythagorean triple in fact generates a countable infinity of nontrivially related matrices having this property.</description>

      <title>Rethinking how randomness is taught in K-12 statistics subjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective teaching and learning of statistics persist as a challenge in K-12 education and has clear impacts in developing competence and confidence of students in entering STEM fields especially in today's digital age of data science. In this paper, it is proposed that the current pedagogy around teaching the concept of randomness, a core element of statistics, is incomplete. It is argued that expanding on the observer-relative nature of randomness will address commonly existing ambiguities on what is and what is not random, help in explaining more complex statistical concepts such as hypothesis testing, and impart greater awareness on the practical value of the practice of statistics in data science.</description>

      <title>The Problem of Algorithmic Collisions: Mitigating Unforeseen Risks in a Connected World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks. While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring capabilities.</description>
