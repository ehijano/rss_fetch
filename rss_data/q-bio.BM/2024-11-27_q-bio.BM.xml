      <title>ProteinWeaver: A Divide-and-Assembly Approach for Protein Backbone Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nature creates diverse proteins through a `divide and assembly' strategy. Inspired by this idea, we introduce ProteinWeaver, a two-stage framework for protein backbone design. Our method first generates individual protein domains and then employs an SE(3) diffusion model to flexibly assemble these domains. A key challenge lies in the assembling step, given the complex and rugged nature of the inter-domain interaction landscape. To address this challenge, we employ preference alignment to discern complex relationships between structure and interaction landscapes through comparative analysis of generated samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ProteinWeaver: (1) generates high-quality, novel protein backbones through versatile domain assembly; (2) outperforms RFdiffusion, the current state-of-the-art in backbone design, by 13\% and 39\% for long-chain proteins; (3) shows the potential for cooperative function design through illustrative case studies. To sum up, by introducing a `divide-and-assembly' paradigm, ProteinWeaver advances protein engineering and opens new avenues for functional protein design.</description>

      <title>Reaction-conditioned De Novo Enzyme Design with GENzyme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of models like RFDiffusionAA, AlphaFold3, AlphaProteo, and Chai1 has revolutionized protein structure modeling and interaction prediction, primarily from a binding perspective, focusing on creating ideal lock-and-key models. However, these methods can fall short for enzyme-substrate interactions, where perfect binding models are rare, and induced fit states are more common. To address this, we shift to a functional perspective for enzyme design, where the enzyme function is defined by the reaction it catalyzes. Here, we introduce \textsc{GENzyme}, a \textit{de novo} enzyme design model that takes a catalytic reaction as input and generates the catalytic pocket, full enzyme structure, and enzyme-substrate binding complex. \textsc{GENzyme} is an end-to-end, three-staged model that integrates (1) a catalytic pocket generation and sequence co-design module, (2) a pocket inpainting and enzyme inverse folding module, and (3) a binding and screening module to optimize and predict enzyme-substrate complexes. The entire design process is driven by the catalytic reaction being targeted. This reaction-first approach allows for more accurate and biologically relevant enzyme design, potentially surpassing structure-based and binding-focused models in creating enzymes capable of catalyzing specific reactions. We provide \textsc{GENzyme} code at https://github.com/WillHua127/GENzyme.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Jones Polynomial and Persistent Jones Polynomial for Knot Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many structures in science, engineering, and art can be viewed as curves in 3-space. The entanglement of these curves plays a crucial role in determining the functionality and physical properties of materials. Many concepts in knot theory provide theoretical tools to explore the complexity and entanglement of curves in 3-space. However, classical knot theory primarily focuses on global topological properties and lacks the consideration of local structural information, which is critical in practical applications. In this work, two localized models based on the Jones polynomial, namely the multiscale Jones polynomial and the persistent Jones polynomial, are proposed. The stability of these models, especially the insensitivity of the multiscale and persistent Jones polynomial models to small perturbations in curve collections, is analyzed, thus ensuring their robustness for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Protein Structure Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.13299v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By folding to particular 3D structures, proteins play a key role in living beings. To learn meaningful representation from a protein structure for downstream tasks, not only the global backbone topology but the local fine-grained orientational relations between amino acids should also be considered. In this work, we propose the Orientation-Aware Graph Neural Networks (OAGNNs) to better sense the geometric characteristics in protein structure (e.g. inner-residue torsion angles, inter-residue orientations). Extending a single weight from a scalar to a 3D vector, we construct a rich set of geometric-meaningful operations to process both the classical and SO(3) representations of a given structure. To plug our designed perceptron unit into existing Graph Neural Networks, we further introduce an equivariant message passing paradigm, showing superior versatility in maintaining SO(3)-equivariance at the global scale. Experiments have shown that our OAGNNs have a remarkable ability to sense geometric orientational features compared to classical networks. OAGNNs have also achieved state-of-the-art performance on various computational biology applications related to protein 3D structures.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Grained Symmetric Differential Equation Model for Learning Protein-Ligand Binding Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In drug discovery, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for protein-ligand binding provides a powerful tool for predicting binding affinities, estimating transport properties, and exploring pocket sites. There has been a long history of improving the efficiency of MD simulations through better numerical methods and, more recently, by utilizing machine learning (ML) methods. Yet, challenges remain, such as accurate modeling of extended-timescale simulations. To address this issue, we propose NeuralMD, the first ML surrogate that can facilitate numerical MD and provide accurate simulations in protein-ligand binding dynamics. We propose a principled approach that incorporates a novel physics-informed multi-grained group symmetric framework. Specifically, we propose (1) the BindingNet model that satisfies group symmetry using vector frames and captures the multi-level protein-ligand interactions, and (2) an augmented neural differential equation solver that learns the trajectory under Newtonian mechanics. For the experiment, we design ten single-trajectory and three multi-trajectory binding simulation tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of NeuralMD, achieving over 1K$\times$ speedup compared to standard numerical MD simulations. NeuralMD also outperforms all other ML approaches, achieving up to 15$\times$ reduction in reconstruction error and 70% increase in validity. Additionally, we qualitatively illustrate that the oscillations in the predicted trajectories align more closely with ground-truth dynamics than those of other machine-learning methods. We believe NeuralMD paves the foundation for a new research paradigm in simulating protein-ligand dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reprogramming Pretrained Target-Specific Diffusion Models for Dual-Target Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-target therapeutic strategies have become a compelling approach and attracted significant attention due to various benefits, such as their potential in overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy. Considering the tremendous success that deep generative models have achieved in structure-based drug design in recent years, we formulate dual-target drug design as a generative task and curate a novel dataset of potential target pairs based on synergistic drug combinations. We propose to design dual-target drugs with diffusion models that are trained on single-target protein-ligand complex pairs. Specifically, we align two pockets in 3D space with protein-ligand binding priors and build two complex graphs with shared ligand nodes for SE(3)-equivariant composed message passing, based on which we derive a composed drift in both 3D and categorical probability space in the generative process. Our algorithm can well transfer the knowledge gained in single-target pretraining to dual-target scenarios in a zero-shot manner. We also repurpose linker design methods as strong baselines for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with various baselines.</description>

      <title>JESTR: Joint Embedding Space Technique for Ranking Candidate Molecules for the Annotation of Untargeted Metabolomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: A major challenge in metabolomics is annotation: assigning molecular structures to mass spectral fragmentation patterns. Despite recent advances in molecule-to-spectra and in spectra-to-molecular fingerprint prediction (FP), annotation rates remain low. Results: We introduce in this paper a novel paradigm (JESTR) for annotation. Unlike prior approaches that explicitly construct molecular fingerprints or spectra, JESTR leverages the insight that molecules and their corresponding spectra are views of the same data and effectively embeds their representations in a joint space. Candidate structures are ranked based on cosine similarity between the embeddings of query spectrum and each candidate. We evaluate JESTR against mol-to-spec and spec-to-FP annotation tools on three datasets. On average, for rank@[1-5], JESTR outperforms other tools by 23.6%-71.6%. We further demonstrate the strong value of regularization with candidate molecules during training, boosting rank@1 performance by 11.4% and enhancing the model's ability to discern between target and candidate molecules. Through JESTR, we offer a novel promising avenue towards accurate annotation, therefore unlocking valuable insights into the metabolome.</description>
