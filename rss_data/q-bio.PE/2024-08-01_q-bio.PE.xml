      <title>Large-scale Epidemiological modeling: Scanning for Mosquito-Borne Diseases Spatio-temporal Patterns in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of climate on mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya is well-established, but comprehensively tracking long-term spatial and temporal trends across large areas has been hindered by fragmented data and limited analysis tools. This study presents an unprecedented analysis, in terms of breadth, estimating the SIR transmission parameters from incidence data in all 5,570 municipalities in Brazil over 14 years (2010-2023) for both dengue and chikungunya. We describe the Episcanner computational pipeline, developed to estimate these parameters, producing a reusable dataset describing all dengue and chikungunya epidemics that have taken place in this period, in Brazil. The analysis reveals new insights into the climate-epidemic nexus: We identify distinct geographical and temporal patterns of arbovirus disease incidence across Brazil, highlighting how climatic factors like temperature and precipitation influence the timing and intensity of dengue and chikungunya epidemics. The innovative Episcanner tool empowers researchers and public health officials to explore these patterns in detail, facilitating targeted interventions and risk assessments. This research offers a new perspective on the long-term dynamics of climate-driven mosquito-borne diseases and their geographical specificities linked to the effects of global temperature fluctuations such as those captured by the ENSO index.</description>

      <title>APOGeT: Automated Phylogeny over Geological Time-scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To tackle the challenge of producing tractable phylogenetic trees in contexts where complete information is available, we introduce APOGeT: an online, pluggable, clustering algorithm for a stream of genomes. It is designed to run alongside a given experimental protocol with minimal interactions and integration effort. From the genomic flow, it extracts and displays species' boundaries and dynamics. Starting with a light introduction to the core idea of this classification we discuss the requirements on the genomes and the underlying processes of building species' identities and managing hybridism. Though stemming from an ALife experimental setting, APOGeT ought not be limited to this field but could be used by (and benefit from) a broader audience.</description>

      <title>The importance of sampling design for unbiased estimation of survival using joint live-recapture and live resight models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Survival is a key life history parameter that can inform management decisions and life history research. Because true survival is often confounded with permanent and temporary emigration from the study area, many studies must estimate apparent survival (i.e., probability of surviving and remaining inside the study area), which can be much lower than true survival for highly mobile species. One method for estimating true survival is the Barker joint live-recapture/live-resight (JLRLR) model, which combines capture data from a study area (hereafter the capture site) with resighting data from a broader geographic area. This model assumes that live resights occur throughout the entire area where animals can disperse to and this assumption is often not met in practice. Here we use simulation to evaluate survival bias from a JLRLR model under study design scenarios that differ in the site selection for resights: global, random, fixed including the capture site, and fixed excluding the capture site. Simulation results indicate that fixed designs that included the capture site showed negative survival bias, whereas fixed designs that excluded the capture site exhibited positive survival bias. The magnitude of the bias was dependent on movement and survival, where scenarios with high survival and frequent movement had minimal bias. In effort to help minimize bias, we developed a multistate version of the JLRLR and demonstrated reductions in survival bias compared to the single-state version for most designs. Our results suggest minimizing bias can be accomplished by: 1) using a random resight design when feasible and global sampling is not possible, 2) using the multistate JLRLR model when appropriate, 3) including the capture site in the resight sampling frame when possible, and 4) reporting survival as apparent survival if fixed sites are used for resight with the single state JLRLR model.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game selection creates cooperative environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of collective cooperation in competitive environments is a well-known phenomenon in biology, economics, and social systems. While most evolutionary game models focus on the evolution of strategies for a fixed game, how strategic decisions coevolve with the environment has so far mostly been overlooked. Here, we consider a game selection model where not only the strategies but also the game can change over time following evolutionary principles. Our results show that coevolutionary dynamics of games and strategies can induce novel collective phenomena, fostering the emergence of cooperative environments. When the model is taken on structured populations the architecture of the interaction network can significantly amplify pro-social behavior, with a critical role played by network heterogeneity and the presence of clustered groups of similar players, distinctive features observed in real-world populations. By unveiling the link between the evolution of strategies and games for different structured populations, our model sheds new light on the origin of social dilemmas ubiquitously observed in real-world social systems.</description>
