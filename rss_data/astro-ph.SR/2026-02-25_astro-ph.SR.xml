      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity XIV. Properties of SMC late-O and B supergiants reveal the metallicity dependence of winds in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the physics of radiation-driven winds of massive stars, the wind properties should depend on the metal content of the stellar atmosphere. Therefore, studying the winds of massive stars in different metallicities provides a sanity check on prescriptions that are widely used in evolutionary calculations. We obtained the stellar and wind properties of a sample of 20 late-O and B supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) from a quantitative combined UV and optical spectroscopic analysis using CMFGEN. By comparing these properties with those of a Large Magellanic Cloud counterpart study, which has a similar sample and data, and employed the same modelling techniques used in this study, We derived a metallicity-dependent recipe for wind momentum, which is applicable for $5.4 \leq \log{L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot}} \leq6.1$ and $14 \leq T_{\rm eff}/{\rm kK} \leq 32$. We find a significant dependence of the wind momentum on the metallicity, which is largely due to the mass-loss rates. We do not find any evidence of a discontinuity in either the mass-loss rate or the ratio of the terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity between $25$ and $21$~kK, which could be attributed to the bi-stability jump. Stellar parameters are consistent across different methods and radiative transfer codes, whereas mass-loss rates differ significantly, with our values being generally lower. We find a discrepancy between the evolutionary and spectroscopic masses in $40\%$ of our sample, with the evolutionary mass usually being systematically higher. The mass-loss rates of blue supergiants are far too low to strip the stellar envelope and the subsequent formation of classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, leading to the conclusion that luminous blue variable eruptions or binary interactions are necessary to explain the characteristics of the WR population in the SMC.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Sympathetic Flaring in TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most flares on the Sun occur at random, but there is a small percentage of "sympathetic flaring" -- the triggering of one flare by another. Previously there had been no widespread confirmation of sympathetic flares on other stars. In this work, we developed a new flare detection algorithm that is sensitive to closely-separated and overlapping stellar flares. We applied it to TESS data and discovered ~ 220,000 flares on ~ 16,000 stars, the majority of which are M-dwarfs. The wait time distribution between flares demonstrates an excess of closely-separated flares, relative to expectations from a Poisson process. We attribute this to sympathetic flares, occurring at a rate of between 4% and 9%, which matches the rate seen on the Sun. Our result is the first statistically robust detection of sympathetic flares on other stars, demonstrating a commonality between the Sun and low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Inspectorch: Efficient rare event exploration in solar observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun is observed in unprecedented detail, enabling studies of its activity on very small spatiotemporal scales. However, the large volume of data collected by our telescopes cannot be fully analyzed with conventional methods. Popular machine learning methods identify general trends from observations, but tend to overlook unusual events due to their low frequency of occurrence. We study the applicability of unsupervised probabilistic methods to efficiently identify rare events in multidimensional solar observations and optimize our computational resources to the study of these extreme phenomena. We introduce Inspectorch, an open-source framework that utilizes flow-based models: flexible density estimators capable of learning the multidimensional distribution of solar observations. Once optimized, it assigns a probability to each sample, allowing us to identify unusual events. We apply this approach by applying it to observations from the Hinode Spectro-Polarimeter, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager at Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board Solar Orbiter. We find that the algorithm assigns consistently lower probabilities to spectra that exhibit unusual features. For example, it identifies profiles with very strong Doppler shifts, uncommon broadening, and temporal dynamics associated with small-scale reconnection events, among others. As a result, Inspectorch demonstrates that density estimation using flow-based models offers a powerful approach to identifying rare events in large solar datasets. The resulting probabilistic anomaly scores allow computational resources to be focused on the most informative and physically relevant events. We make our Python package publicly available at https://github.com/cdiazbas/inspectorch.</description>

      <title>Stellar flare study of nearby young moving group members with TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze TESS data to explore stellar flares and rotational characteristics in members of Nearby Young Moving Groups (NYMGs). Our study focuses on 417 members of NYMGs aged 10-150 Myr. Using detrended light curves from the TESS Science Office Quick-Look Pipeline, coupled with our own additional detrending scheme for fast rotators, we systematically detect and characterize 6,288 stellar flares from 27,416 flare candidates. We analyzed light curves from Cycles 1-4 of the TESS mission, finding that for each NYMG member analyzed, at least one stellar flare was present. Flare candidates are initially detected using the AltaiPony flare package, followed by a recovery flare amplitudes, durations, and local continuum background levels. We examine the relationship between flare energy, age, and mass, finding a reduced flaring rate for late-type stars with age for high energy flares, as well as 5.5 times more flares detected in the 10-minute cadence TESS data compared to 30-minute cadence data. Additionally, flare events with extreme energies (E &gt;= 10^{34} erg) on M-dwarf and solar-type stars, providing implications for further exploration into exoplanet habitability.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Spatial Complexity in Flare Ribbon Substructure and Its Relationship to Magnetic Reconnection Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent three-dimensional flare models suggest that flare-ribbon substructure is linked to the fragmentation of the reconnecting current sheet in the corona. Flare-ribbon substructure can therefore potentially serve as a unique diagnostic tool for physical processes in the flare current sheet. In this paper, we describe a new method to quantify the evolution of ribbon substructure, which first extract the ribbon's leading bright front and the quantifies its morphology using the box-counting dimension and Correlation Dimension Mapping (CDM). We first test our method using synthetic observations. We then find that when the flare ribbon boundary has more multi-spatial-scale features (higher box-counting dimension), hard X-ray (HXR) emission and magnetic reconnection rates are the strongest. We also find that the flare-ribbon complexity characterized by CDM has moderate correlation with the IRIS Si IV 1402.77 {\AA} non-thermal velocity (in the negative-polarity ribbon) and reconnection flux rates (in ribbons of both magnetic polarities). We conclude that the build-up of the spatial complexity of the ribbons at multiple spatial scales can serve as an observational proxy for current-sheet fragmentation in the corona.</description>

      <title>Rotation of a Solar Jet Driven by Plasma Flow along Helical Magnetic Fields in an Active Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar jets, collimated plasma ejections driven by magnetic reconnection, play a vital role in energy transport and coronal heating. While rotational motions in jets are often attributed to magnetic field untwisting, alternative explanatory mechanisms remain possible. This study investigates a rotating jet in an active region observed on 2023 August 1 using multi-wavelength observations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), Chinese Ha Solar Explorer (CHASE), and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), combined with a self-consistent time-dependent magnetofrictional (TMF) model and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. Spectral diagnostics reveal coexisting red and blue shifts along the edges and central axis of the jet, indicating helical plasma motion within a twisted magnetic structure. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the jet's rotation arises from plasma propagating along helical open field lines, formed via reconnection between a pre-existing flux rope and overlying magnetic fields. Contrary to classical untwisting models, both linear and rotational velocities decrease with altitude during the jet propagation. These results highlight that the observed rotation results from plasma spiral motion along twisted fields rather than untwisting dynamics of the magnetic field itself, providing new insights into solar jet energetics and their connection to broader solar phenomena.</description>

      <title>Constraining the onset height of coronal mass ejection driven shocks using near-Sun observations in visible and radio wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the debated issues about the onset of the type II radio bursts near the Sun is the heliocentric distance ($r$) at which the associated magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks are formed, and the association of the latter with the coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The debate is primarily due to the absence of routine CME observations in whitelight at $r\,{&lt;}\,1.5R_{\odot}$. We present here an example for how joint observations with the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard the recently launched ADITYA-L1 (the first dedicated Indian space solar mission, \citealp{Parate2025}), and Gauribidanur radio facilities could be useful to address the issue.</description>

      <title>Multiple protostellar outflows from a single protostar with a misaligned disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how misalignment between the core angular momentum and the large-scale magnetic field affects protostellar outflows, and whether a single protostellar system can drive multiple outflow components. We perform three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized rotating cores, focusing on the formation of a protostar, a circumstellar disk, and magnetically driven outflows. The initial angle between the core angular-momentum vector and the magnetic field is systematically varied from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. All models launch a classical magnetocentrifugal disk wind (DW) roughly along the local disk normal. For large misalignment, the system also develops a spiralflow (SF) component that propagates parallel to the disk plane. In a representative model with a $60^\circ$ misalignment, the outflow transitions from a DW-dominated to an SF-dominated phase, with the SF becoming more massive and more extended than the DW, and the two components intermittently coexisting. Across the model suite, the maximum mass and size ratios of SF to DW, as well as the relative lifetimes of the two components, increase for misalignment angles $\gtrsim60^\circ$. We propose that secondary, misaligned outflows (or their fossil remnants) observed in some protostellar systems can be interpreted as the SF component, while the main bipolar outflow traces the DW from the same misaligned system.</description>

      <title>Long-term optical variability of high-mass X-ray binaries. III. Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Be/X-ray binaries are the most numerous group of high-mass X-ray binaries. Their long-term optical and infrared variability reflects the evolution of the circumstellar disk around the luminous companion. This variability manifests photometrically as an excess of flux that increases with wavelength and spectroscopically as line emission. The disk is also expected to generate linear polarization. We present a systematic study of the optical long-term polarimetric variability of Be/X-ray binaries on data collected over 10 years. Our aim is to characterize the polarimetric properties of these systems and to probe the structure of their circumstellar disks. We have been monitoring Be/X-ray binaries visible from the Northern hemisphere with the RoboPol polarimeter. Optical polarimetric variability is a common trait in Be/X-ray binaries. The variability can be attributed to the Be star's circumstellar disk. Our polarization analysis confirms previous claims based on spectroscopic data that the circumstellar disks in BeXBs are, on average, smaller and denser than those in Be stars in non-binary systems. Our data also confirms the presence of highly distorted disks before giant X-ray outbursts, although this result is still affected by the lack of simultaneous and well-sampled observations during major X-ray outbursts.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abvb: a Type Ibn/Icn supernova with evidence of helium and an extreme offset from its host galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic and photometric observations and analysis of SN 2024abvb, a peculiar transitional Type Ibn/Icn supernova located at an unusually large projected distance from its host galaxy (21.5 kpc). SN 2024abvb displays an extended rise time in the $g$- and $o$-bands (10.1 and 10.6 days respectively), followed by a linear decline in all photometric bands. Comparisons with other supernova subclasses show that the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024abvb are distinct from Type~Ibn and Type Icn events, with a higher peak $r$-band luminosity and lower blackbody temperatures. Spectra reveal an initial blue continuum and narrow P-Cygni profiles, with C {\sc ii} $\lambda$5890 dominating in emission, persisting at late phases, and showing a rapid decline in the expansion velocity. Weak He {\sc i} $\lambda$5876 features are tentatively detected at early times. Analysis of progenitor scenarios rules out thermonuclear origins based on incompatible light curve shapes and spectral signatures. A rare massive star progenitor appears unlikely given the low local star formation rate. The most plausible origin is an ultra-stripped supernova scenario involving a binary system; this best explains the observed separation from the host, the low circumstellar material mass, the fast photometric evolution and the low nickel production, although a discrepancy in model versus observed ejecta mass remains. These results reinforce the classification of SN 2024abvb as a distinctive Type Ibn/Icn event and highlight the diversity of progenitor channels for interacting supernovae.</description>

      <title>Infrared spectropolarimetry of a C-class solar flare footpoint plasma -- I. Spectral features and forward modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed high-spatial resolution spectropolarimetric observations of active region NOAA 13363 during a C-class flare with the Gregor Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) on 16 July 2023. We examine the coupling between the photosphere and the chromosphere, studying the polarimetric signals during a period that encompasses the decaying phase of a C-class flare and the appearance of a new C-class flare at the same location. We focus on the analysis of various spectral lines. In particular, we study the Si I 10827 {\AA}, Ca I 10833.4 {\AA}, Na I 10834.9 {\AA}, and Ca I 10838.9 {\AA} photospheric lines, as well as the He I 10830 {\AA} triplet. GRIS data revealed the presence of flare-related red- and blueshifted spectral line components, reaching Doppler velocities up to 90 km/s, and complex Si I profiles where the He i spectral line contribution is blueshifted. In contrast, the photospheric Ca i and Na i transitions remained unchanged, indicating that the flare did not modify the physical conditions of the lower photosphere. We combined that information with simultaneous imaging in the Ca ii H line and TiO band with the improved High-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI+), finding that the flare emission did not affect the inverse granulation or nearby plage, in agreement with the results from GRIS. We also complement the previous studies with a forward modelling computation, concluding that the He I spectral line emission reflects a complex response of the flaring chromosphere. Radiative excitation from coronal EUV irradiation, energy deposition by flare-accelerated electrons, and dynamic field-aligned plasma flows likely act together to produce the observed supersonic downflows and upflows. We plan to expand these findings through inversions of the He I 10830 {\AA} triplet signals in the future.</description>

      <title>Stellar structure, magnetism and the variational principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter interacts through two long range forces: gravity and electromagnetism. While all matter contributes to the gravitational potential, electromagnetic effects were traditionally expected to cancel in large systems because positive and negative charges balance. Yet astrophysical objects clearly show long range electromagnetic behavior, so the cancellation cannot be perfect. This paper develops a model for stationary aggregation of matter into a star that consistently includes angular momentum and electromagnetic effects. We reformulate the standard polytropic stellar model as a variational problem and extend it to include the kinetic energy of rigid rotation and the electromagnetic interaction energy between oppositely charged baryonic matter. The electromagnetic contribution to the action is taken to be the minimal energy required to generate the stellar magnetic dipole moment. This energy has two parts: the pure electromagnetic contribution, expressible as a surface integral, and the free energy difference between magnetized and unmagnetized matter, obtained by analyzing a degenerate electron gas in a background of cold ions. Differential forms provide a convenient mathematical framework. The resulting model incorporates electromagnetic effects into stellar structure in a way consistent with linearized general relativity. Although the full system forms a complex open boundary problem, exact solutions exist under simplifying assumptions. The phase diagram predicted by the simplified model shows patterns that may motivate further study of the balance between matter, gravitation, and electromagnetism</description>

      <title>Multiple Extreme Ultraviolet Peaks Attributed to Three-dimensional Magnetic Reconnection in a Long-duration Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are a major driver of hazardous space weather, whose intense electromagnetic emissions and energetic particles can significantly disturb the near-Earth space environment. Therefore, understanding the physical processes during a solar flare and predicting its radiation profiles are of great importance. In this study, we analyze and model an M1.4 two-ribbon long-duration flare, whose multiple extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission peaks are found to correspond to different three-dimensional (3D) magnetic reconnections driven by the continuous evolution of a flux rope. In particular, the second and third peaks in the 335 {\AA} EUV channel originate from longer and higher flare loops with extended cooling times, formed by reconnection between flux-rope field lines and ambient sheared-arcade field lines ($ar\text{--}rf$) and between flux-rope field lines themselves ($rr\text{--}rf$). These results are supported by the drifting of the flux-rope footpoint (and flare ribbon) and the decrease in toroidal flux of the flux rope, as well as by the connectivity transfer of representative field lines in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. This work points out, for the first time, new manifestations of the 3D flare scenario in EUV light curves. On the one hand, it provides an explanation for two-ribbon late-phase flares. On the other hand, the conclusions presented here help bridge the gap between imaging observations, EUV light-curve diagnostics, and the magnetic structures of the associated coronal mass ejections.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of 486 Barium Stars Identified in GALAH DR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 486 Ba stars identified in the GALAH DR4 survey using high-resolution spectra and precise abundance measurements. The sample was selected based on s-process enrichment criteria involving the abundances of Ba and La relative to Eu, and further refined using the signed-distance method, resulting in the largest sample of Ba stars to date, including five newly identified Ba dwarfs. Using astrometric and kinematic parameters from Gaia DR3 and StarHorse, we derived the Galactic velocity components for 367 Ba stars and found that most belong to the thin or thick disk, while 18 exhibit halo-like kinematics. Chemical abundance analysis suggests that most Ba stars are of in situ origin, whereas two stars (4077588766331013248 and 6692980582560946304) display signatures of accreted populations. The E-Lz diagram further shows that star 4077588766331013248 lies within the region of substructure ED-8. The observed decline of [Ba/Fe] and [La/Fe] with increasing metallicity implies that s-process elements originate from nucleosynthetic sites distinct from those of iron-peak elements, while the decreasing [hs/ls] ratio toward higher metallicity indicates higher neutron capture efficiency at lower metallicity. Both giant and dwarf Ba stars-except for 6053735173729807872-are confirmed binaries hosting white dwarf companions. Moreover, we estimated the masses of the former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companions to these Ba stars based on the good agreement between the FRUITY AGB model predictions and their observed abundance patterns.</description>

      <title>The hybrid Nova Vul 2024 (=V615 Vul)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present daily optical, absolute-fluxed spectroscopy of the heavily reddened Nova Vul 2024 (=V615 Vul), obtained in both low- and high-resolution echelle modes from discovery on 29 July 2024 through the nebular phase. Refined astrometry confirms the positional consistency with a potential progenitor. Reliable estimates of the decline time (t3=10.7 +/- 0.5 d) and reddening (E(B-V)=1.6 +/- 0.1) enabled the application of the Maximum Magnitude - Rate of Decline relation, yielding a distance of 5.0 +/- 1.0 kpc in excellent agreement with 3D Galactic extinction maps. Around maximum light, the nova displayed a Fe II-type spectrum with very broad emission lines (FWZI 5800 km s-1) and high-velocity P-Cygni absorptions. Shortly after t3, coincident with the onset of hard X-ray emission, it showed pronounced photometric oscillations driven mainly by continuum variations. At the same time, He/N features developed alongside Fe II lines, identifying V615 Vul as a rare hybrid nova. During the nebular phase, the ionization level increased up to [Fe VII] and likely [Fe X]. The ejecta show no evidence of neon overabundance and expand ballistically, as indicated by the constant line widths, stable profiles, and characteristic castellation of the high-resolution emission lines.</description>

      <title>Planet formation at the inner edge of the dead zone -- I: the interplay between accretion outbursts and dust growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inner edge of the dead zone in protoplanetary disks has been shown to periodically go unstable, leading to accretion outbursts and annular substructure within the dead zone. While dust opacities play a key role in this process, the thermal and dynamical effects of dust drift and growth have not been fully explored. We investigate the evolution of accretion outbursts in the inner disk and their impact on the formation of dust-rich substructure with a fully dynamic dust model. In doing so, we aim to highlight the importance and limitations of dust growth in forming planets in this region. We carry out radiation hydrodynamics simulations of a protoplanetary disk including prescriptions for the structure of the inner edge of the dead zone, viscous and irradiation heating, radiative cooling, dust-gas dynamics, and dust evolution. We find that accretion outbursts at the inner disk edge can lead to the formation of multiple dust rings that extend deep inside the dead zone (~1 au) and diffuse on viscous timescales (~10 kyr for $\alpha$=1e-4). The rings contain dust masses of up to ~1.6 Earth masses, possibly kickstarting planet formation. Dynamic modeling of dust fragmentation enhances the total opacity during the burst, yielding more intense outbursts that penetrate deeper into the dead zone. Our results highlight the thermal and dynamical importance of treating dust dynamics self-consistently in models of accretion outbursts. Additional modeling is needed to characterize the inevitable non-axisymmetric structures arising from accretion outbursts and their observational prospects.</description>

      <title>Time-variable Scattered Light in Herbig Disks Observed with Subaru/SCExAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument, we present near-infrared K-band polarimetric imaging of nine Herbig stars selected from a volume-limited sample within 200 pc. We detect the disks around MWC 480, HD 163296, and HD 143006 for the first time with SCExAO, and compare these observations with previous VLT/SPHERE datasets to identify surface-brightness variability. In MWC 480, we resolve two azimuthal brightness dips near the disk minor axis and find evidence that one of them shifted between 2021 and 2022. In HD 163296, we identify an apparent linear azimuthal motion of a localized peak in polarized intensity along the outer ring over a 15-month baseline. The rapid motion of these features relative to the local Keplerian velocity suggests that the observed variability is driven by changing illumination rather than physical material motion.Due to uncertainties in the underlying scattering background, however, we cannot determine the precise physical origin of the variability. No significant disk variability is detected in HD 143006 over a 10-month baseline. We also report the first detection of a protoplanetary disk using the fast-PDI mode on SCExAO, illustrating both the promise and current limitations of this observing mode. Finally, we report non-detections toward HD 144432, HD 56895, PDS 76, HIP 80425, HD 148352, and HIP 81474. All non-detections with Meeus classifications belong to Group II systems and are likely self-shadowed. For these six systems, we measure the system-integrated polarization fraction and angle of linear polarization, providing quantitative constraints on their unresolved circumstellar environments.</description>

      <title>70 years of spectroscopy of the photosphere and the solar chromosphere at the Pic du Midi Observatory (1956-2026)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the solar corona at the Pic du Midi began with Bernard Lyot and his spectro coronagraph installed on the multi-purpose equatorial mount of the Baillaud cupola. It was not until 1956 that domes and instruments specifically dedicated to observations of the photosphere and the solar chromosphere appeared. On the occasion of the International Geophysical Year, a solar spectroscopy laboratory was created to the west of the Pic du Midi, based on two spectrographs of 4 m and 9 m focal length. In 1961 the turret dome appeared to the east of the Pic, later equipped with an 8 m spectrograph. Around 1965, the Baillaud dome finally specialized in the corona with a new table and new spectrographs. At the same time, a revolution in infrastructure took place at the Pic in a few years, which we present as well as the solar spectrographs and their goal.</description>

      <title>Infall onto the Protoplanetary Disk during the Gravitational Collapse of a Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of models for matter infall from a collapsing molecular cloud is an essential part of numerical studies on the formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks. In this article, the widely used Nakamoto and Nakagawa (1994) model is analyzed and modifications are proposed to complement the initial model. These improvements include calculation for the outer boundary of a molecular cloud and refinement of the initial density distribution within. Also, due to the finite size of a cloud, the approach for computing the rate of mass infall onto the protoplanetary disk during collapse is modified. The proposed enhancements are aimed at eliminating the key limitations of the initial model, but do not affect its advantages, such as simplicity in numerical implementation. Using the modified model, we investigate the duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects and compare the modeling results with observational data. The results indicate a shorter duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects, especially in star-forming regions with a high amplitude of the initial density perturbation of prestellar condensation.</description>

      <title>Accurate transition and hyperfine data in Ag I from Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and Relativistic Coupled-Cluster methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silver is a key tracer of the weak r-process in late-type stars. However, when the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) needs to be relaxed, accurate abundance determinations become even more sensitive to complete sets of reliable transition data. The aim of this work is to provide accurate and extensive results of excitation energies, radiative transition and hyperfine data for Ag I. The Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) methods were used in the present work. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation (QQE) approach is applied to the MCDHF transition rates to estimate the uncertainty according to the National Institute of Science and Technology Atomic Spectroscopic Data (NIST ASD) terminology. Excitation energies, transition data and hyperfine structure constants were calculated for $18$ states up to $4d^{10}8s$. $57$ electric dipole (E1) transition rates and weighted oscillator strengths are computed and estimated to be in the following NIST ASD uncertainty classes; $4$ in AA, $12$ in A+, $5$ in A, $13$ in B+, $6$ in B, $4$ in C+ with AA $\leq 1\%$, A+ $\leq 2\%$, A $\leq 3\%$, B+ $\leq 7\%$, B $\leq 10\%$, C+ $\leq 18\%$. The remaining transitions, mainly weak transitions involving the $4d^95s^2$ states, are estimated to be in the E class $&gt;50\%$. The computed lifetimes from both the MCDHF and RCC methods are in good mutual agreement and mostly fall within the error bars of available experimental values from laser induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements. The $4d^95s^2~^2D_{5/2}$ metastable state, important for establishing the ionization balance, decay through an E2 transition to the ground state. The calculated lifetime is $163\,\mathrm{ms}$. The computed hyperfine interaction constants from the MCDHF and RCC methods are in good agreement and compare well with the scattered experimental constants.</description>

      <title>F10.7 Index Prediction: A Multiscale Decomposition Strategy with Wavelet Transform for Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we construct Dataset A for training, validation, and testing, and Dataset B to evaluate generalization. We propose a novel F10.7 index forecasting method using wavelet decomposition, which feeds F10.7 together with its decomposed approximate and detail signals into the iTransformer model. We also incorporate the International Sunspot Number (ISN) and its wavelet-decomposed signals to assess their influence on prediction performance. Our optimal method is then compared with the latest method from S. Yan et al. (2025) and three operational models (SWPC, BGS, CLS). Additionally, we transfer our method to the PatchTST model used in H. Ye et al. (2024) and compare our method with theirs on Dataset B. Key findings include: (1) The wavelet-based combination methods overall outperform the baseline using only F10.7 index. The prediction performance improves as higher-level approximate and detail signals are incrementally added. The Combination 6 method integrating F10.7 with its first to fifth level approximate and detail signals outperforms methods using only approximate or detail signals. (2) Incorporating ISN and its wavelet-decomposed signals does not enhance prediction performance. (3) The Combination 6 method significantly surpasses S. Yan et al. (2025) and three operational models, with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 18.22%, 15.09%, and 8.57%, respectively, against the former method. It also excels across four different conditions of solar activity. (4) Our method demonstrates superior generalization and prediction capability over the method of H. Ye et al. (2024) across all forecast horizons. To our knowledge, this is the first application of wavelet decomposition in F10.7 prediction, substantially improving forecast performance.</description>

      <title>MHD Simulations of Strongly Magnetized HII Region Evolution: Evidence for Ionized Gas Filamentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of HII regions in the Central Molecular Zone have shown a highly filamentary morphology distinct from HII regions in other parts of the galaxy. We present magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of strongly magnetized (plasma-$\beta$ &lt;&lt; 1) HII region evolution that investigate and describe the formation of these ionized gas filaments. HII region evolution has been simulated in a 30 pc$^3$ box, in distinct models with pre-placed overdensities in the ambient medium and overdensities that have been generated with driven turbulence. We find that when these overdensities are seeded in the ambient medium before the birth of the ionizing source, the photoionized plasma stripped off of these dense blobs is funneled into long filaments along the magnetic field lines. The length and emission measure of these ionized gas filaments are similar to the filaments observed in the Central Molecular Zone. Given that these filaments are effectively magnetically-confined flows of photoionized gas, their density and curvature are influenced by the density of the blob and the geometry of the configuration.</description>

      <title>The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program. IX. The RR Lyrae Population in WLM with HST and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars are a common, dependable Population II distance indicator, and provide an independent tracer of early star formation. Here, we utilize archival HST/ACS and JWST/NIRCam observations of the nearby dwarf star-forming galaxy WLM to study RR Lyrae in JWST filters. We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST's efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR. We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data. The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of $\mu = 24.85\pm0.05$ ($0.93\pm0.02$ Mpc). This is closer than previous measurements, primarily attributed to consistency with the Gaia scale. Lastly, although the JWST PWZ fit has large uncertainties and a poorly-constrained slope, it represents a first-of-its-kind PWZ calibration in NIRCam filters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar coronae are believed to be the main birthplace of various stellar magnetic activities. However, the structures and properties of stellar coronae remain poorly understood. Using the Space Weather Modelling Framework with the Alfv\'{e}n Wave Solar Model (SWMF-AWSoM) and dynamo-generated surface magnetic maps, here we model the coronae of four solar-type stars. By incorporating the Sun, our work covers a range of stars with the rotation varying from 1.0 to 23.3 $\Omega_\odot$ (periods of 25 to 1 days). Guided by observations, we scale the magnetic field strength with increasing rotation, covering a range between 6.0 G to 1200 G approximately. In our models, energy release associated with small-scale magnetic flux is a key source of coronal heating and is essential for reproducing realistic coronal structures. Our models capture dense (1$-$2 orders of magnitude higher than solar values) and ultra-hot ($\sim 10\,\mathrm{MK}$) coronae dominated by closed field structures. Using the CHIANTI atomic database, we also compute synthetic X-ray spectra and derive the corresponding X-ray luminosities $(L_X)$, which follow a scaling law to magnetic field $L_X \propto \langle|\mathbf{B}|\rangle^{1.75}$. Furthermore, the coronal X-ray emission is found to be rotationally modulated by the alternating presence of bright active regions and dark coronal holes. These results provide new insights into the extremely high-energy coronae of rapidly rotating solar-type stars, which differ markedly from the Sun.</description>

      <title>Assessing the star formation history of all-sky and part-sky 100pc white dwarf samples</title>

Abstract: Thanks to Gaia and large-scale spectroscopic follow-up surveys (4MOST, DESI, WEAVE, SDSS-V), it is now possible to build representative and minimally biased samples of the local white dwarf population. Here we analyse several volume-limited 100pc samples of white dwarfs, constructed from different surveys and studies, to evaluate their completeness and residual biases. We model the underlying star formation history and Galactic disc age via comparison with simulated populations of white dwarfs to quantitatively characterise completeness. We assess whether the benefit of Gaia XP spectra in datasets outweighs the reduction in sample size, and to what extent targeted, part-sky, and magnitude limited surveys can be used in comparison to all-sky volume limited surveys. Additionally, we simulate the 4MOST 100PC sub-survey and discuss its use to better understand the local star formation history.</description>

      <title>Modeling Binary Lenses and Sources with the BAGLE Python Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool that can be used to find and measure the mass of isolated and dark compact objects. In many microlensing events, the lens, the source, or both may be a binary system. In this work, we introduce binary source and lens models into the gravitational lensing formalism encoded in the Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events (BAGLE) python software package. These new binary models in BAGLE account for Keplerian orbits. We also add binary models with fewer parameters that describe the binary orbital motion as acceleration, linear, or stationary motion of the secondary companion; these are useful when the orbit has a very low eccentricity or the orbital period is much longer than the microlensing timescale. The model parameterizations based on these binary lensing equations will enable joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. Consequently, binary microlensing events with complex astrometric trajectories can be used to uniquely determine physical parameters like mass and distance, unlike photometry-only microlensing which often yield ambiguous solutions. These binary models will be used to fit microlensing event data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, and other surveys.</description>

      <title>SN 2022ngb: A faint, slowly evolving Type IIb supernova with a low-mass envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of double white dwarfs: evolutionary effects on system properties</title>

Abstract: Double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are natural outcomes of binary stellar evolution and key sources for future space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We investigate how different binary interaction channels shape the physical and orbital properties of DWD systems, focusing on component masses, orbital separations, core compositions, and mass transfer rates. Using the binary population synthesis code COMPAS, we evolve $10^7$ binaries with physically motivated initial distributions of binary parameters. Our simulations reproduce the strong bimodality in the final orbital separations, including a pronounced deficit of systems around $100-500 \rm\,R_\odot$, arising from distinct evolutionary pathways: wide DWDs predominantly originate from stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), while close DWDs form through unstable RLOF leading to at least one common envelope (CE) phase. Moreover, we show that the core compositions of WDs provide a powerful tracer of evolutionary history: He-core WDs are strongly concentrated in close systems, whereas CO-core WDs span the full separation range and exhibit a small mass gap in wide binaries. We further identify a correlation between the donor mass transfer rate and the final orbital separation, highlighting the impact of non-conservative mass transfer on the resulting orbital configuration of DWD systems. These results underscore the links among evolutionary channels, chemical composition, and mass transfer rates; thereby provide a unique framework for interpreting Gaia DWD samples and forecasting the joint electromagnetic and GW population accessible to LISA.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure of coronal dark halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At low coronal temperatures around or below 1 MK distinct areas in the surroundings of active regions (AR) show emission at a level significantly below the emission coming from the quiet Sun (QS). These areas are referred to as dark halos, dark canopies, or dark moats. To better understand the nature of dark halos we study the connection between the photospheric magnetic field and coronal emission at different temperatures. Combining Solar Orbiter data from the high-resolution Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instruments allows us to identify these areas that are dark in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) in the immediate vicinity of an AR. We probe both the photospheric magnetic field as well as the coronal intensities as a function of distance to the AR NOAA 12893. The dark halo has an unsigned magnetic flux density similar to the QS, but shows a strong radial dependence with distance from the AR centre. It drops by 38 % from 6.1 G at the inner boundary to 3.8 G at the outer, shifting from above to below QS levels. Coronal emission $\leq$1 MK is $\sim$40 % below QS and shows no dependence on distance to the AR centre. In contrast, at $\geq$1.6 MK, emission exceeds QS levels, but declines outward toward QS values. A few hot loops extend from the AR periphery across the halo, while at lower temperatures no such loops appear and short loops dominate the corona. The reduced unsigned magnetic flux density in the outermost parts of the dark halo, below QS level, suggests that reduced coronal heating due to weak underlying magnetic flux heating could be partially responsible for the reduced emission around 1 MK. Closer to the AR, other mechanisms might lead to reduced heating. The different loops structures detected for hotter and cooler coronal temperatures likely play a crucial role in understanding coronal dark halos.</description>

Abstract: HelioSpectrotron 5000 (HS5000) is an interactive, multi-resolution solar spectral atlas designed to facilitate direct comparison between high-resolution reference spectra and observations obtained with a wide range of ground-based instruments. Based on the Hamburg FTS atlas, the HS5000 provides both absolute intensity and continuum-normalized spectra at arbitrary spectral ranges and resolutions, as well as curated line identifications and optional telluric contamination. This framework enables rapid wavelength calibration, line identification, and context image generation.</description>

      <title>The morphological stability of open clusters: a new 2D perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open clusters (OCs) usually evolve gradually as the number of their members changes, which can be manifested in their morphological characteristics. We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140$\pm$0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720$\pm$0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083$\pm$0.116 and 0.733$\pm$0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013$\pm$0.110 and 0.529$\pm$0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk. Besides, the sample OCs younger than 30 Myr display a shallow slope of 0.751$\pm$0.166, with those older than 800 Myr (1.442$\pm$0.128), reflecting that young OCs likely endure both internal disruptions, such as early dynamical heating weakening core binding and more severe external disturbances, compared to older OCs.</description>
