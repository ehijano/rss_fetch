      <title>Mutual compatibility/incompatibility of quasi-Hermitian quantum observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of quasi-Hermitian quantum mechanics the eligible operators of observables may be non-Hermitian, $A_j\neq A_j^\dagger$, $j=1,2, \ldots,K$. In principle, the standard probabilistic interpretation of the theory can be re-established via a reconstruction of physical inner-product metric $\Theta\neq I$ guaranteeing the quasi-Hermiticity $A_j^\dagger \,\Theta=\Theta\,A_j$. The task is easy at $K=1$ because there are many eligible metrics $\Theta=\Theta(A_1)$. In our paper the next case with $K=2$ is analyzed. The criteria of the existence of a shared metric $\Theta=\Theta(A_1,A_2)$ are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Dispersive analysis for one-dimensional charge transfer models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-dimensional linear Schr\"odinger equations with multiple moving potentials, known as transfer charge models. Focusing on the non-self-adjoint setting that arises in the study of solitons, we systematically develop the scattering theory and establish dispersive estimates under the assumption that the potentials move at significantly different velocities, even in the presence of unstable modes. In particular, we prove the existence of wave operators, asymptotic completeness, and pointwise decay of solutions, without requiring the absence of threshold resonances. Our analysis set up the fundamental work for studying the nonlinear dynamics of multi-solitons, including asymptotic stability and collisions.</description>

Abstract: We describe an advanced version of the AFW-technique proposed in [Lett. Math. Phys., 113, 121 (2023)],[Lobachevskii J. Math., 44(6), 2169 (2023)] which allows us to obtain lower semicontinuity bounds, continuity bounds and local lower bounds for characteristics of quantum systems and discrete random variables.
  We consider applications of the new version of the AFW-technique to several basic characteristics of quantum systems (the von Neumann entropy, the energy-type functionals, the quantum relative entropy, the conditional entropy and the entanglement of formation).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define new type of convolution and correlation theorems associated with the offset linear canonical transform (OLCT). Additionally, we discuss their applications in multiplicative filter design, which may prove useful in optics and signal processing for signal recovery. Furthermore, we explore the real Paley-Wiener (PW) and Boas theorems for the OLCT, analyzing signal characteristics for OLCT within the L2 domain.</description>

      <title>Capillary liquid channels in cylindrical support surfaces: stability and bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planes and circular cylinders are models of interfaces of a fluid when the support surface is translationally invariant in a direction of the space. After a study of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi operator, it is investigated when planar strips and sections of circular cylinders are stable in cylindrical symmetric support surfaces. This analysis depends on the curvature of the support at the contact points with the interface. The Plateau-Rayleigh instability phenomenon is studied finding the critical value $h_0&gt;0$ such that rectangular pieces of planar strips or circular cylinders of length greater than $h_0$ are necessarily unstable. It is also studied when new morphologies of capillary surfaces can emerge from given circular cylinders. Using the method of bifurcation by simple eigenvalues, we establish conditions on the support surface that prove that when $0$ is a simple eigenvalue of the Jacobi operator, there is bifurcation from explicit circular cylinders. It will be presented examples of supports (parabolic and catenary cylinders) where this bifurcation appears.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the defocusing Hartree NLS with white noise external potential on T^3 i.e. the Hartree NLS whose linear part is given by the Anderson Hamiltonian. A Strichartz-type estimate is established for the Anderson Hamiltonian using perturbative arguments and the local and global well-posedness of the NLS is considered with initial data in the domain and form-domain of the Anderson Hamiltonian under different regularity assumptions on the Hartree interaction. Furthermore, we establish the Anderson Hartree NLS as an effective equation describing many-body Bosonic systems and, in particular, we prove the convergence of the linear Schr\"odinger equation for the many body system to the BBGKY hierarchy for the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores quantum heuristics based on Mixer Hamiltonians, which enable the restriction of investigations to a specific subspace. Approaches utilizing Mixer Hamiltonians can be incorporated into the QAOA algorithm, and we can define Mixer Hamiltonians as mapping functions that transform qubit strings into solution sets. Our objective is to define a swap based mixer for the TSP to investigate only during QAOA, the qubit-strings that modelize TSP solution. The experiment carried on a 5-customers TSP instances proves the mixer efficiency.</description>

      <title>Ind-cluster algebras and infinite Grassmannians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A prototypical examples of a cluster algebra is the coordinate ring of a finite Grassmannian: using the Pl\"ucker embedding the cluster algebra structure allows one to move between `maximal sets' of algebraically independent Pl\"ucker coordinates via mutations. Fioresi and Hacon studied a specific colimit of the coordinate rings of finite Grassmannians and its link with the infinite Grassmannian introduced by Sato and independently by Segal and Wilson in connection with the Kadomtsev-Petiashvili (KP) hierarchy, an infinite set of nonlinear partial differential equations which possess soliton solutions. In this article we prove that this ring is a cluster algebra of infinite rank with the structure induced by the colimit construction. More generally, we prove that cluster algebras of infinite rank are precisely the ind-objects of a natural category of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ regularisation and the functional measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of moving Cartan geometries described by quotients of Lie groups and Lie algebras with spacetime dependant structure constants and construct associated deformed topological gauge action functionals for Lorentzian (including dS and AdS) and Lorentz$\times$Weyl moving geometries. We compute the equations of motion of the gauge + matter actions and show that they dictate at each spacetime point the geometry, leading to both a dynamical source of dark energy and a dynamical gravitational coupling, described by combinations of scalars built from spacetime curvature, torsion and the matter content of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the vertex-reinforced jump processes on a \(d\)-dimensional hierarchical lattice are recurrent for \(d &lt; 2\) and transient for \(d &gt; 2\). We also explore certain regimes when \(d = 2\). The proof of recurrence relies on an exponential decay estimate of the fractional moment of the Green's function, which, unlike the classical approach used for \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), requires additional entropy estimates via stability of the model distribution under coarse grain operation, which leverages its linear reinforcement.</description>

      <title>Diffusivity of the Lorentz mirror walk in high dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Lorentz mirror walk in dimension $d\geq 2$, mirrors are randomly placed on the vertices of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ at density $p\in[0,1]$. A light ray is then shot from the origin and deflected through the various mirrors in space. The object of study is the random trajectory obtained in this way, and it is of upmost interest to determine whether these trajectories are localized (finite) or delocalized (infinite). A folklore conjecture states that for $d=2$ these trajectories are finite for any density $p&gt;0$, while in dimensions $d\geq 3$ and for $p&gt;0$ small enough some trajectories are infinite. In this paper we prove that for all dimensions $d\geq 4$ and any small density $p$, the trajectories behave diffusively at all polynomial time scales $t\approx p^{-M}$ with $M&gt;1$, and in particular, they do not close by this time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use weakly nonlinear geometric optics to study a model for the DC Kerr effect (the Kerr electro-optic effect), in which a light beam propagating through a material with strong nonlinear optical properties can have its polarization rotated by applying a strong external electric field. This effect is used to build fast switches (Kerr cells). We prove existence of an exact solution of the nonlinear Maxwell system with a cubic Kerr nonlinearity, with the wavelength $h$ being a small parameter. We justify the effect within this model, and also solve the inverse problem of recovery of the nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$ from the change of the polarization.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional delta-Bose gas: skew-product relative motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Feynman-Kac-type formula for the relative motion of the two-body delta-Bose gas in two dimensions. The multiplicative functional is not exponential, and the process is a skew-product diffusion uniquely extended in law, in the sense of Erickson [30], from ${\rm BES}(0,\beta{\downarrow})$ of Donati-Martin and Yor [27] as the radial part. We give two different proofs of the formula. The first uses the original excursion characterization of ${\rm BES}(0,\beta\downarrow)$, and the second is via the lower-dimensional Bessel processes at the expectation level. The latter proof contrasts the long-standing approach for delta-function interactions by adding mollifiers to the Laplacians since the present approximations are from "lower, fractional dimensions." Moreover, the second proof conducts a new study of ${\rm BES}(0,\beta\downarrow)$ as an SDE since we handle the drift via certain ratios of the Macdonald functions. The properties proven include the strong well-posedness and comparison of the SDE of ${\rm BES}(0,\beta\downarrow)$ for all initial conditions. In particular, this well-posedness contrasts the fact that the skew-product diffusion for the Feynman-Kac-type formula has a singular drift of $L^p_{\rm\tiny loc}$-integrability only for $ p\leq 2$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the subcritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on non-compact quantum graphs with an attractive potential supported in the compact core, and investigate the existence and the nonexistence of Ground States, defined as minimizers of the energy at fixed $L^2$-norm, or mass. We finally reach the following picture: for small and large mass there are Ground States. Moreover, according to the metric features of the compact core of the graph and to the strength of the potential, there may be an interval of intermediate masses for which there are no Ground States. The study was inspired by the research on quantum waveguides, in which the curvature of a thin tube induces an effective attractive potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corner VOA and the Super Macdonald Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between the quantum corner VOA $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, which can be regarded as a generalization of quantum $W_N$ algebra, and Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We demonstrate precisely that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial twists in gl_n Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra and show that it is a Hopf algebra. The associated universal R-matrix is also obtained via an admissible Drinfel'd twist, making the algebra a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra. The fundamental representation of the universal R-matrix yields the familiar set-theoretic (combinatorial) solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We then apply the same Drinfel'd twist to the gl_n Yangian after introducing the augmented Yangian. We show that the augmented Yangian is also a Hopf algebra and we obtain the twisted version of the augmented gl_n Yangian as well as the twisted R-matrix.</description>
