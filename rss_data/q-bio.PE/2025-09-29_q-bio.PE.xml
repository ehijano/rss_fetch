      <title>A phenotype-structured reaction-diffusion model of avascular glioma growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a phenotype-structured reaction-diffusion model of avascular glioma growth. The model describes the interaction dynamics between tumour cells and oxygen, and takes into account anisotropic cell movement and oxygen diffusion related to structural anisotropy of the brain's extracellular environment. In this model, phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells is captured by a continuous phenotype-structuring variable, the value of which evolves due to phenotypic changes. We first analyse a one-dimensional version of the model and formally show, through a Hopf-Cole transformation, that it admits, in appropriate asymptotic regimes, phenotypically heterogeneous travelling wave solutions, wherein the locally prevailing cell phenotype varies across the wave due to the presence of oxygen gradients. This provides a mathematical formalisation for the emergence of intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity driven by differences in oxygen availability across the tumour. We then report on the results of both 1D simulations, which corroborate the results of formal asymptotic analyses, and 2D simulations, which also demonstrate the impact of anisotropy in cell movement and oxygen diffusion on tumour growth and on the phenotypic composition of the tumour edge. These results are complemented with additional results of 3D simulations, which are carried out on the geometry of the brain by using a hybrid finite difference-finite element method and integrating patient-specific magnetic resonance imaging data with diffusion tensor imaging data.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Vendi score in genomic epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vendi score (VS), a diversity metric recently conceived in the context of machine learning, with applications in a wide range of fields, has a few distinct advantages over the metrics commonly used in ecology. It is classification-independent, incorporates abundance information, and has a tunable sensitivity to rare/abundant types. Using rich COVID-19 sequence data as a paradigm, we develop methods for applying the VS to time-resolved sequence data. We show how the VS allows for characterization of the overall diversity of circulating viruses and for discernment of emerging variants prior to formal identification. Furthermore, applying the VS to phylogenetic trees provides a convenient overview of within-clade diversity which can aid viral variant detection.</description>

      <title>The Pfaffian Structure of CFN Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic techniques in phylogenetics have historically been successful at proving identifiability results and have also led to novel reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we study the ideal of phylogenetic invariants of the Cavender-Farris-Neyman (CFN) model on a phylogenetic network with the goal of providing a description of the invariants which is useful for network inference. It was previously shown that to characterize the invariants of any level-1 network, it suffices to understand all sunlet networks, which are those consisting of a single cycle with a leaf adjacent to each cycle vertex. We show that the parameterization of an affine open patch of the CFN sunlet model, which intersects the probability simplex, factors through the space of skew-symmetric matrices via Pfaffians. We then show that this affine patch is isomorphic to a determinantal variety and give an explicit Gr{\"o}bner basis for the associated ideal, which involves only $\binom{n}{2}$ coordinates rather than $2^{n}$. Lastly, we show that sunlet networks with at least 6 leaves are identifiable using only these polynomials and run extensive simulations, which show that these polynomials can be used to accurately infer the correct network from DNA sequence data.</description>
