      <title>Next Generation LLRF Control Platform for Compact C-band Linear Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Low-Level RF (LLRF) control circuits of linear accelerators (LINACs) are conventionally realized with heterodyne based architectures, which have analog RF mixers for up and down conversion with discrete data converters. We have developed a new LLRF platform for C-band linear accelerator based on the Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) device from AMD Xilinx. The integrated data converters in the RFSoC can directly sample the RF signals in C-band and perform the up and down mixing digitally. The programmable logic and processors required for signal processing for the LLRF control system are also included in a single RFSoC chip. With all the essential components integrated in a device, the RFSoC-based LLRF control platform can be implemented more cost-effectively and compactly, which can be applied to a broad range of accelerator applications. In this paper, the structure and configuration of the newly developed LLRF platform will be described. The LLRF prototype has been tested with high power test setup with a Cool Cooper Collider (C\(^3\)) accelerating structure. The LLRF and the solid state amplifier (SSA) loopback setup demonstrated phase jitter in 1 s as low as 115 fs, which is lower than the requirement of C\(^3\). The rf signals from the klystron forward and accelerating structure captured with peak power up to 16.45 MW will be presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Energy Depletion and Re-Acceleration of Driver Electrons in a Plasma-Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For plasma-wakefield accelerators to fulfil their potential for cost effectiveness, it is essential that their energy-transfer efficiency be maximized. A key aspect of this efficiency is the near-complete transfer of energy, or depletion, from the driver electrons to the plasma wake. Achieving full depletion is limited by the process of re-acceleration, which occurs when the driver electrons decelerate to non-relativistic energies, slipping backwards into the accelerating phase of the wakefield and being subsequently re-accelerated. Such re-acceleration is unambiguously observed here for the first time. At this re-acceleration limit, we measure a beam driver depositing (57 $\pm$ 3)\% of its energy into a 195-mm-long plasma. Combining this driver-to-plasma efficiency with previously measured plasma-to-beam and expected wall-plug-to-driver efficiencies, our result suggests that plasma-wakefield accelerators can in principle reach or even exceed the energy-transfer efficiency of conventional accelerators.</description>

      <title>Electron Diffusion in Microbunched Electron Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent electron cooling is a novel method to cool dense hadron beams on timescales of a few hours. This method uses a copropagating beam of electrons to pick up the density fluctuations within the hadron beam in one straight section and then provide corrective energy kicks to the hadrons in a downstream straight, cooling the beam. Microbunched electron cooling is an extension of this idea which induces a microbunching instability in the electron beam as it travels between the two straights, amplifying the signal. However, initial noise in the electron bunch will also be amplified, providing random kicks to the hadrons downstream which tend to increase their emittance. In this paper, we develop an analytic estimate of the effect of the electron noise and benchmark it against simulations. We also discuss how this effect has impacted the cooler design.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional maximum-entropy phase space tomography using normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle accelerators generate charged particle beams with tailored distributions in six-dimensional position-momentum space (phase space). Knowledge of the phase space distribution enables model-based beam optimization and control. In the absence of direct measurements, the distribution must be tomographically reconstructed from its projections. In this paper, we highlight that such problems can be severely underdetermined and that entropy maximization is the most conservative solution strategy. We leverage normalizing flows -- invertible generative models -- to extend maximum-entropy tomography to six-dimensional phase space and perform numerical experiments to validate the model's performance. Our numerical experiments demonstrate consistency with exact two-dimensional maximum-entropy solutions and the ability to fit complicated six-dimensional distributions to large measurement sets in reasonable time.</description>
