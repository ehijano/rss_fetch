      <title>Strong backreaction of gauge quanta produced during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During inflation an axion field coupled to a gauge field through a Chern-Simons term can trigger the production of gauge quanta due to a tachyonic instability. The amplification of the gauge field modes exponentially depends on the velocity of the axion field, which in turn slows down the rolling of the axion field when backreaction is taken into account. To illustrate how the strength of the Chern-Simons coupling and the slope of the axion potential influence the particle production, in this paper we consider a toy model in which the axion field is a spectator with a linear potential. In the strong backreaction regime, the energy density of the gauge field quasiperiodically oscillates. The steep slope of the axion potential linearly increases the peak amplitude of the energy density while the strong coupling linearly decreases the peak amplitude. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lorentz invariance from the event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is the cornerstone of relativity theory. Its implications have been verified experimentally with a variety of approaches. The detection of a muon at extremely high energy detected by the ARCA detector in the Mediterranean sea, the most energetic particle directly measured up to date, allows to put additional constraints on Lorentz non-invariant theories. The prediction of some of those theories is that the lifetimes of particles in the laboratory frame 'decrease' rather than 'increase' with increasing $\gamma$. In this frame the sheer fact that the muon traversed the whole ARCA detector puts a lower limit on the muon lifetime in the laboratory frame, that implies upper limits on Lorentz violating parameters.</description>

      <title>Hunting for heavy $Z^\prime$ with IceCube neutrinos and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the minimal gauged B-L extension of the Standard Model, we demonstrate that PeV-scale dark matter (DM) and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) can be simultaneously explained through the three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) present in the theory. The DM candidate undergoes decay into light neutrinos, providing an explanation for the observed IceCube events, while the other two RHNs generate the BAU via leptogenesis. The breaking of gauge symmetry gives rise to detectable gravitational waves (GWs) from decaying cosmic strings (CS), making this framework testable at several future GW detectors-despite being beyond the reach of conventional collider experiments due to the extremely weak coupling. The symmetry-breaking scale establishes a connection between particle masses, couplings, and the GW spectrum, offering a unified and predictive scenario.</description>

      <title>Charge-changing weak interactions for right-handed particles in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments have shown that the charge-changing weak interaction is purely left-handed, which is taken into account in the Standard Model by the inclusion of a left-handed projection operator in the Lagrangian. Nevertheless, it will be shown here that the Standard Model predicts charge-changing weak interactions for right-handed fermions that can be larger than those for left-handed fermions if the mass is sufficiently large, as is the case for the top quark. Here we are using the conventional terminology in which a massive fermion with its spin parallel to its momentum is referred to as being right-handed in the relativistic limit, where it is in an approximate eigenstate of the chirality operator. These effects are due to the way in which the field of the W boson is quantized, which gives a divergent tensor product in the Feynman propagator in the unitary gauge. It will be shown that the off-diagonal terms in the propagator can convert a left-handed projection operator into a right-handed projection operator, which allows an interaction with right-handed fermions even though the Lagrangian is left-handed. Experiments to date have only demonstrated charge-changing weak interactions for left-handed particles, and an alternative quantization approach that eliminates the divergent off-diagonal terms in the W boson propagator and avoids these difficulties will be considered. The alternative approach appears to be in agreement with existing experiments, but additional high-energy experiments may be required in order to distinguish its predictions from those of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Evolution of entropy at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) entropy, defined as $ S(x,\mu^2) \simeq \ln[xg(x,\mu^2)]$ at small Bjorken variable $x$, where $\mu$ is the observable scale and
  the gluon distribution $xg(x,\mu^2)$ is derived from the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations. We aim to evolve the DIS entropy, which is not directly observable, using a Laplace transform technique. This approach allows us to obtain an analytical solution for the DIS entropy based on known initial gluon distribution functions. We consider both leading-order (LO) and higher-order approximations for the DIS entropy, incorporating the evolved gluon distribution function at the initial scale. The DIS entropy, influenced by purely gluonic emissions, varies with higher-order corrections in the running coupling. By comparing predictions with charged hadron multiplicity data, we are able to define the evolution. Additionally, we investigate the derivative of the scaling entropy as a model dependent on the running coupling to determine the parameter $ \lambda$, the Pomeron intercept. We find that the values of $\lambda(x,\mu^2)$ decrease as the order of evolution increases, which is consistent with the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) Pomeron in the LO and NLO approximations. This investigation provides insights into the dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at high energies.</description>

      <title>A new study of the interactions of the axion with mesons and photons using a chiral effective Lagrangian model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the results obtained in a previous work and investigate the most interesting decay processes involving axions, photons and the lightest pseudoscalar mesons in the more general case in which the quarks (and, therefore, the mesons) may be charged under the $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry, making use of a chiral effective Lagrangian model with $N_f=3$ light quark flavors, which also includes the flavor-singlet pseudoscalar meson and implements the $U(1)$ axial anomaly of the fundamental theory. In particular, we compute the axion mass, the electromagnetic coupling of the axion to photons, and the amplitudes and widths of the decay processes $\eta/\eta'\rightarrow \pi\pi a$.</description>

      <title>Extraction of low-mass diffractive cross section from the discrepancy between ATLAS and TOTEM total cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the LHC, two experiments - ATLAS and TOTEM - measure the total proton-proton cross section. Unfortunately, a significant discrepancy, persisting at different collision energies, is observed between the values reported by the two groups. This paper considers the hypothesis that this tension is predominantly driven by the assumption about the low-mass diffraction used in one of the measurement methods. It is shown that in such a case it is possible to extract the low-mass diffraction cross section from measurements of ATLAS and TOTEM. The results are compared with other data-driven estimates, showing better agreement than the original assumption.</description>

      <title>No gauge cancellation at high energy in the five-vector $R_\xi$ gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel $R_\xi$ gauge in the five-vector (5V) framework within the Abelian Higgs model. In the Cartesian basis of the complex Higgs field, the 5V $R_\xi$ gauge ensures non-divergent tree-level amplitudes for each Feynman diagram in the high-energy limit. This framework pinpoints the origin of high-energy divergences in tree-level amplitudes for each diagram, providing a criterion for quantifying the degree of divergences from other gauges. The 5V description necessitates treating the Goldstone field as the fifth gauge-field component, offering deeper insight into the dynamics of massive gauge bosons, particularly its longitudinal mode. The impact of this framework is demonstrated by rigorously comparing tree-level amplitudes from the 5V $R_\xi$ gauge with those from the conventional 4V $R_\xi$ gauge and the Feynman diagram gauge, the latter of which exhibits no gauge cancellation, similar to the 5V $R_\xi$ gauge.</description>

      <title>Production of Dark Photons through Higher Electromagnetic Moments at LDMX: Simulations and Model Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the projected sensitivity of LDMX for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) to the case of dark photons produced through higher order electromagnetic moments. These moments arise from loop diagrams involving portal matter fields, along with the gauge fields of new symmetry groups. Due to the Lorentz structures, in particular the momentum dependence, of these additional interactions, the kinematic distributions expected at missing momentum/energy experiments vary with model in addition to dark photon mass. By considering four additional types of interactions -- magnetic and electric dipole, charge radius, and anapole moment -- we show that LDMX Phase-II is expected to probe the relic target of these additional dark photon models. We compare the analytic with the numerical methods for calculating the dark bremsstrahlung cross section, and compute the kinematic distributions for each model. The potential for model discrimination in the scenario of non-zero signal events at LDMX is discussed. We find that there is a degeneracy between the dark photon mass and model, which can be partially broken by considering both the energy and the transverse momentum of the recoil electron.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant quantum dynamics of a relativistic electron in counterpropagating laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of an ultrarelativistic electron in strong counterpropagating laser beams is investigated. In contrast to the stimulated Compton scattering regime, we consider the case when in the electron rest frame the frequency of the counterpropagating wave greatly exceeds that of the copropagating one. Taking advantage of the corresponding approximation recently developed by the authors for treating the classical dynamics in this setup, we solve the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in the quasiclassical approximation in the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) framework. The obtained wave function for the Dirac equation shows entanglement between the kinetic momentum and spin of the electron, while the spin-averaged momentum coincides with the classical counterpart as expected. The derived wave functions will enable the calculation of the probabilities of nonlinear QED processes in this counterpropagating fields configuration.</description>

      <title>$\Omega_c$ baryon spectrum and strong decays in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the masses of the $1S$-, $1P$-, $1D$-, $2S$-, and $2P$-wave $\Omega_c$ baryon states within a semi-relativistic constituent quark potential model. Furthermore, the strong decay properties for the excited $\Omega_c$ states are evaluated by using the masses and wave functions obtained from the potential model. In a unified framework, we provide a reasonable explanation of both the masses and widths for the newly observed $\Omega_c$ resonances $\Omega_c(3000)$, $\Omega_c(3050)$, $\Omega_c(3065)$, $\Omega_c(3090)$, $\Omega_c(3120)$, $\Omega_c(3185)$, and $\Omega_c(3327)$. Based on the obtained decay properties and mass spectrum, we further suggest optimal channels and mass regions to find the missing $\Omega_c$ resonances. We expect our study can provide a useful reference for establishing the $\Omega_c$ spectrum.</description>

      <title>Particle production from inhomogeneities: general metric perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present universal formulas for particle production from gravitational inhomogeneities. In the massless limit the result is strikingly simple and completely determined by the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor that is fixed up to a constant - the central charge - for conformally coupled scalars, massless fermions and gauge fields. This result can be applied to any conformally coupled theory, weakly or strongly interacting, unifying previous derivations for fields of different spin and for scalar and tensor perturbations. We derive the results using the Schwinger method of 1PI effective action and through Bogoliubov transformations that allows to compute exclusive information on the distribution of particles. We then apply these results to stochastic backgrounds of scalar and tensor perturbations that can be generated by various phenomena such us inflationary perturbations and first order phase transitions. Differently from particle production usually considered in cosmology this mechanism allows for the production of massless fields. In particular the abundance induced by inhomogeneities can easily reproduce the dark matter abundance if scalar perturbations produced from inflation are enhanced at short scales.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD model for heavy and exotic mesons at finite density: A self-consistent dynamical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent dynamical holographic QCD model to investigate the mass spectra and melting behavior of heavy and exotic mesons at finite temperature and finite density. Our approach is based on the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) framework and incorporates an elsewhere already introduced, albeit by hand, phenomenological non-quadratic dilaton profile. This allows one to capture the non-linear Regge trajectories of heavy-flavor mesons and model certain exotic states. We show how to construct such models by actually solving the coupled Einstein, Maxwell, and dilaton field equations, ensuring mathematical self-consistency to replace any ad-hoc input. At finite temperature, we analyze the confinement-deconfinement transition via a Hawking-Page phase transition. We compute the spectral functions, revealing the sequential melting of quarkonia as the temperature is increased. Extending to finite density, we explore the impact of baryon chemical potential on meson stability, showing significant modifications in spectral peaks and effective potentials that indicate a more rapid melting of mesonic states as the chemical potential increases in the deconfined phase. The dual of the small/large black hole transition now indicates towards a first order phase transition line ending at a second order critical point. Interestingly, the spectral functions smoothly cross this phase transition line.</description>

      <title>Positive-Energy Warp Drive in a De Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the result of H. Ellis who embedded a warp bubble in the background of a black hole, we introduce a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe. We show that under certain conditions (namely, that the bubble is moving in the radial direction at a velocity equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe), it is possible for the bubble to have strictly non--negative Eulerian energy density and satisfy the averaged weak and null energy conditions (though they are violated locally). We also prove a more generic theorem that if perturbations of vacuum energy produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames, they always result in local violations of NEC and WEC. We discuss the implications of these results and their possible applications to models of dark energy like "dark fluid" and quintessence, as well as to physical systems like Casimir cavities and analog gravity setups.</description>

      <title>Non-local high-$p_t$ transport in anisotropic QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a numerical study of non-local partonic transport in anisotropic QCD matter, relevant to the evolution of hard probes in the aftermath of high-energy nuclear scattering events. The recently derived master equation, obtained from QFT considerations, differs from Boltzmann transport by incorporating a non-local elastic scattering kernel arising from density gradients. After rewriting the master equation in a form suitable for numerical implementation and assuming a static density profile, we compare the non-local evolution to Boltzmann transport, demonstrating that the new interaction kernel is essential for accurately describing the azimuthal structure of the final-state momentum distribution. We further study the non-local partonic transport in the case of a matter profile governed by two-dimensional hydrodynamics, accounting for its flow and generalizing the evolution equation. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond classical transport at high-$p_t$ to accurately capture the structure of jets propagating through structured QCD matter. The master equation used in the numerical simulations can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art transport codes.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology -- Numerical analyses on lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Recently VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. These suggest that the Abelian mechanism based on the Abelian monopoles from VNABI play an important role in these topological quantities instead of instantons. The additional term L(x) is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG) and the Maximal Abelian +U(1) gauge (MAU1) in addition to the gradient flow. The additional term tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ({\tau}) when infrared monopoles responsible for color confinement are also suppressed. The topological charge Qt and its Abelian counterpart Qa are discussed also on lattice. Theoretically Qa(A)=3Qt(A) is expected, but a simple lattice definition of Qa(A) is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG and around -2 in MAU1 in a typical configuration where Qt(A) is stabilized around -1 after the flow time {\tau} is larger than 2.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation in Core Collapse Supernova: The Impact of Spacetime Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor evolution inside a core-collapse supernova is a topic of active research. The core of a supernova is an intense source of neutrinos and antineutrinos. Self-interaction among neutrinos (as well as antineutrinos) gives rise to a rich phenomenology not seen in terrestrial situations. In studies of the dynamics of flavor evolution in such environments, the gravitational effects are generally ignored. Although the curvature outside a dense core does not deviate much from a flat space, the spin of the neutrinos can still couple to the torsion of the spacetime. These extra degrees of freedom of curved spacetime have interaction strengths that are proportional to the density of the neutrinos and the other fermions \cite{Chakrabarty:2019cau} \cite{Barick:2023qjq} as well as the coupling constants of the spin-torsion interaction. We have studied the effects of such interactions in flavor evolution inside a core-collapse supernova \cite{Ghose:Manuscript}. The self-interaction gets modified by the spin-torsion interaction and the oscillation dynamics is modified. We have seen that there are noticeable changes in the flavor dynamics when the neutrino density is uniform. We have also studied the effects of such interaction in a realistic core-collapse supernova (CCSN). As neutrino astronomy enters the precision era, this study will shed light on the potential of neutrino fluxes from CCSN to probe the neutrino-neutrino interaction.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls with bias directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry can lead to the formation of domain walls in the early Universe. In this work, we explore the impact of bias directions on the dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls, mainly focusing on the $N = 3$ model with a biased potential. Utilizing the Press-Ryden-Spergel method, we numerically investigate the dynamics of domain walls with lattice simulations. We find notable differences in the dynamics of domain walls due to bias directions. Our results indicate that the annihilation time depends not only on the vacuum energy difference $\delta V$ but also on bias directions described by the relative potential difference $ \zeta $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is pointed out that every renormalizable field theory has a symmetry which is hidden in plain sight. In all practical cases, it is also broken softly, either explicitly or spontaneously. The soft explicit breaking mass terms may be assumed naturally small compared to the scalar mass-squared terms. Implications for extensions of the standard model are discussed. New left-right model of two-loop radiative Dirac neutrino mass is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmon, a collective mode of electronic excitation in solid-state detectors, provides a novel way to detect light dark matter (DM). In this work, we present the conditions of DM to produce plasmon resonance, requiring relativistic velocities for light DM, and generalize the collective excitation framework to account for relativistic DM. As a demonstration, we consider the cosmic ray boosted DM (CRDM) and find that the plasmon resonance can be significantly enhanced in the scenario with a light mediator. Utilizing the first data from SENSEI experiment with the skipper-CCDs at SNOLAB, we obtain a new strong limit on the sub-MeV DM-electron scattering cross section.</description>

Abstract: Under the exponential parametrization scheme $ m^{\nu}_{ij}\sim r e^{i \theta}$, we propose a \emph{unique} neutrino mass matrix texture that exhibits four correlations among its elements. The mixing scheme obtained from the proposed texture is consistent with experimental observations.

      <description>arXiv:2407.06520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigation of decay and scattering processes of particles in a vortex state offers a novel and promising approach for probing particle structure. Our study reveals distinct properties of vortex neutron decay, which deviate from those of classical plane-wave neutron decay. We present the energy-angle distributions of the final-state electron and antineutrino in unpolarized vortex neutrons, as well as angle distributions integrated over their energies. Notably, we provide theoretical calculations of the decay behavior of neutrons with varying vortex cone angles and initial energies. We propose that identifying the vortex state of the initial neutron can be achieved by analyzing the angular and energy distributions of the final-state particles, introducing new degrees of freedom for studying weak interactions and neutron decay kinematics that have been previously overlooked in particle physics. This timely investigation takes advantage of recent advancements in vortex neutron preparation and analysis, opening up new avenues for exploring the fundamental properties of matter.</description>

      <title>Graph Reinforcement Learning for Exploring BSM Model Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a methodology for performing scans of BSM parameter spaces with reinforcement learning (RL). We identify a novel procedure using graph neural networks that is capable of exploring spaces of models without the user specifying a fixed particle content, allowing broad classes of BSM models to be explored. In theory, the technique is applicable to nearly any model space with a pre-specified gauge group. We provide a generic procedure by which a suitable graph grammar can be developed for any BSM model which features user-specified symmetry groups and a finite number of different possible particle species. As a proof of concept, we construct the graph grammar for theories with vector-like leptons that may or may not be charged under a dark U(1) group, inspired by portal matter extensions of the sub-GeV vector portal/kinetic mixing simplified dark matter models. We then use this graph grammar to create a RL environment tasked with creating models with these vector-like leptons that are consistent with a list of a variety of precision observables. The RL agent succeeds in developing models that can address the observed muon anomalous magnetic moment discrepancy while remaining consistent with flavor violation and electroweak precision observables, including both constructions that have previously been studied as well as new models which have not, to our knowledge, previously been identified. By inspecting the resulting ensembles of models that the agent produces and experimenting with different configurations for our RL environment and graph grammar, we also infer various lessons about the development of these environments that can be transferable to RL scans of more complicated model spaces, and comment on future directions for the development of this technique into a more mature tool.</description>

      <title>Heavy Neutral Lepton searches at an ICARUS-like detector using NuMI beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of non-zero neutrino masses points to the likely existence of multiple SM neutral fermions. When such states are heavy enough that they cannot be produced in oscillations, they are referred to as Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs). In minimal models, the HNL production and decay are controlled by SM interactions and the mixing between HNLs and the active neutrino and typically result in relatively long lifetimes if the masses are in the MeV-GeV range. We have studied the physics case and technical feasibility for a dedicated HNL search using the NuMI beam at an ICARUS-like detector. Our analysis conclusively demonstrates that the constraints on the mixing of the HNL as a function of its mass for an ICARUS-like detector with NuMI beam are highly competitive with the limits obtained from present experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the solar basin -- the accumulated population of weakly-interacting particles on bound orbits in the Solar System. We focus on particles starting off on Sun-crossing orbits, corresponding to initial conditions of production inside the Sun, and investigate their evolution over the age of the Solar System. A combination of analytic methods, secular perturbation theory, and direct numerical integration of orbits sheds light on the long- and short-term evolution of a population of test particles orbiting the Sun and perturbed by the planets. Our main results are that the effective lifetime of a solar basin at Earth's location is $\tau_{\rm eff} = 1.20\pm 0.09 \,\mathrm{Gyr}$, and that there is annual (semi-annual) modulation of the basin density with known phase and amplitude at the fractional level of 6.5% (2.2%). These results have important implications for direct detection searches of solar basin particles, and the strong temporal modulation signature yields a robust discovery channel. Our simulations can also be interpreted in the context of gravitational capture of dark matter in the Solar System, with consequences for any dark-matter phenomenon that may occur below the local escape velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some phenomenological effects of kinetic mixing between the hypercharge field and a new $U(1)$ gauge field in specific $Z^\prime$ models that ameliorate the tensions between measurements and Standard Model predictions in $b \rightarrow s\ell^+ \ell^-$ decays. To this end, we rederive the dimension-6 SMEFT coefficients resulting from integrating out the kinetically-mixed (`malaphoric') $Z^\prime$ field. The kinetic mixing provides a family-universal component to the couplings of the $Z^\prime$ field, which can improve fits to lepton flavour universality observables. We show how kinetic mixing improves the best fit of the $B_3-L_2$ model to $b\rightarrow s$ data by 7.0 units of $\chi^2$ while remaining compatible with other relevant data sets such as electroweak precision observables and measurements of $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^-$ at LEP2.</description>

Our study consists of a ladder-box, a tennis-court, and two reducible ladder-box-like families. The results for the master integrals of these families are expressed up to order six in the dimensional regulator in terms of real-valued multiple polylogarithms. Furthermore, a semi-numeric solution is provided, employing generalized power series expansions using the package DiffExp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD), we study the production of doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ via photon-photon fusion at electron-positron colliders. Two diquark configurations of $(cc)[^3S_1]_{\bar{3}}$ and $(cc)[^1S_0]_{6}$ are considered, and the $(cc)[^3S_1]_{\bar{3}}$ state dominates the produciotn of $T_{cc}$. We discuss two hadronization models of $(cc)[^3S_1]_{\bar{3}}$ intermediate state into the tetraquark $T_{cc}$. It is found that it is promising to observe the tetraquark $T_{cc}$ via photon-photon fusion process both at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). We find that the cross sections are sensitive to charm quark mass, and they also have strong dependence on the hadronization models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the possibility that neutral and charged scalars lighter than the 125 GeV Higgs boson might exist within the framework of the $\mathcal{CP}$-conserving Aligned-two-Higgs-doublet model. Depending on which new scalar (scalars) is (are) light, seven different scenarios may be considered. Using the open-source code HEPfit, which relies on Bayesian statistics, we perform global fits for all seven light-mass scenarios. The constraints arising from vacuum stability, perturbativity, electroweak precision observables, flavour observables, Higgs signal strengths, and direct-detection results at the LEP and the LHC are taken into account. Reinterpreted data from slepton searches are considered too. It turns out that the seven scenarios contain sizeable regions of their parameter space compatible with all current data. Although not included in the global fits, the possible implications of $(g-2)_\mu$ are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Accidental Peccei-Quinn Symmetry From Gauged U(1) and a High Quality Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct explicit models that solve the axion quality problem originating from quantum gravitational effects. The general strategy we employ is to supplement the Standard Model and its grand unified extensions by an anomaly-free axial $U(1)_a$ symmetry that is gauged. We show that for several choices of the gauge quantum numbers of the fermions, this setup leads to an accidental $U(1)$ symmetry with a QCD anomaly which can be identified as the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry that solves the strong CP problem. The $U(1)_a$ gauge symmetry controls the amount of explicit PQ symmetry violation induced by quantum gravity, resulting in a high quality axion. We present two classes of models employing this strategy. In the first class (models I and II), the axial $U(1)_a$ gauge symmetry acts on vector-like quarks leading to an accidental KSVZ-type axion. The second class (model III) is based on $SO(10)$ grand unified theory extended by a gauged $U(1)_a$ symmetry that leads to a hybrid KSVZ--DFSZ type axion. The couplings of the axion to the electron and the nucleon are found to be distinct in this class of hybrid models from those in the KSVZ and DFSZ models, when the axion is identified as the dark matter of the universe, which can be used to test these models. Interestingly, all models presented here have domain wall number of one, which is free of cosmological problems that typically arise in axion models.</description>

      <title>QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ from $\tau$-decay: Summary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this talk, I summarize the recent determinations in Ref.[1] of the QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ within the SVZ expansion using the ratio of Laplace sum rule (LSR) ${\cal R}_{10}^A(\tau)$ and $\tau$-like moments ${\cal R}_{n,A},\, {\cal R}_{n,V-A}$within stability criteria in the axial-vector (A) and V-A channels of the $\tau$- semi-hadronic decays. The factorization of the four-quark condensate is violated by a factor 6 like in the case of the $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons data. There is no exponential growth of the size of higher dimension condensates which does not favour (by duality) a significant effect of the so-called Duality Violation (DV). The extracted value of $\alpha_s$ is in good agreement with the one from $e^+e^-$ and indicates that the determination at the observed $\tau$-mass is not the optimal one and leads to an overestimate of its actual value.</description>

      <title>Bell Inequalities and Quantum Correlations in $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 2e\,2\mu$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum correlations in Higgs-boson decays $\bigl(H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 2e\,2\mu\bigr)$ using CMS open data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV, incorporating realistic detector effects. By reconstructing the polarization density matrix of the two-boson system and evaluating the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) Bell operator $I_3$, we quantify entanglement in the $ZZ$ state. Our analysis shows that $90.7\%$ of signal events $\bigl(H \rightarrow ZZ^*\bigr)$ violate the Bell inequality $\bigl(I_3&gt;2\bigr)$, indicating strong quantum correlations, while only $11.8\%$ of non-resonant continuum background events $\bigl(pp \rightarrow ZZ\bigr)$ exhibit such a violation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of testing fundamental quantum mechanics at high energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effect of Chiral Torsion on Neutrino Oscillation in Long Baseline Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In curved spacetime, neutrinos experience an extra contribution to their effective Hamiltonian coming from a torsion-induced four-fermion interaction that is diagonal in mass basis and also causes neutrino mixing while propagating through fermionic matter. This geometrical quartic interaction term appears as the modification to the neutrino mass term and significantly influences both neutrino conversion and survival probabilities. Since this term varies linearly with matter density, long baseline (LBL) experiments would be a good choice to probe this effect. We put bounds on torsional coupling parameters and also see the impact of torsion on physics sensitivities in the DUNE experiment.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the constraints on superluminal neutrino Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) parameters from the observation of the ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A by KM3NeT collaboration in cases of linear $n=1$ and quadratic $n=2$ LIV scenarios. Assuming extragalactic origin of the event, we obtain the constraints on LIV mass scale $\Lambda_{n=1} = 5.4 \times 10^{30}\, \mbox{GeV}$ and $\Lambda_{n=2} = 3.5 \times 10^{19}\, \mbox{GeV}$ from the absence of neutrino splitting.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity study of a sapphire detector using Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment(ICNSE) has been proposed at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process using electron antineutrinos produced from reactors. Phenomenological studies are performed to find out the sensitivity of sapphire detector for various fundamental physics parameters at an exposure of one year. Reactors of different core compositions, sizes, and thermal powers have been considered as sources of electron antineutrinos. The potential of the ICNSE to measure the weak mixing angle at a low energy regime has been extracted. Furthermore, the detector's capability has been investigated for examining the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, including their magnetic moment. Additionally, an exploration has been conducted on the detector's sensitivity in restricting new interactions between neutrinos and electrons or nuclei, thereby constraining the parameter space related to light mediators. It is found that the ICNSE detector can put a stronger constraints on the scalar and vector mediators masses.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of final particle states in the resonant trident pair production in a strong electromagnetic wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resonant trident pair production process in the collision of ultrarelativistic electrons with a strong electromagnetic wave is theoretically studied. Under resonant conditions, the intermediate virtual gamma-quantum becomes real. As a result, the original resonant trident pair production process effectively splits into two first-order processes by the fine structure constant: the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect and the electromagnetic field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process. The kinematics of the resonant trident pair production process are studied in detail. It is shown that there are two different cases for the energies and outgoing angles of final particles (an electron and an electron-positron pair) in which their quantum entanglement is realized. In the first case, the energy and outgoing angles of final ultrarelativistic particles are uniquely determined by the parameters of the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect (the outgoing angle of the final electron and the quantum parameter of the Compton effect). In the second case, the energy and outgoing angles of final particles are uniquely determined by the electromagnetic field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process (the electron-positron pair outgoing angle and the Breit-Wheeler quantum parameter). It is shown that in a sufficiently wide range of frequencies and intensities of a strong electromagnetic wave, and in the case of ultrarelativistic initial electrons, the differential probability of the resonant trident pair production process with simultaneous registration of the outgoing angles of final particles can significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceed the total probability of the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect.</description>

      <title>Effect of Light Nuclei on Chemical Freeze-out Parameters at RHIC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the chemical freeze-out of hadrons, including light-and strange-flavor particles and light nuclei, produced in Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), was investigated. Using the thermal-FIST thermodynamic statistical model, we analyzed various particle sets: those inclusive of light nuclei, those exclusive to light nuclei, and those solely comprising light nuclei. We determined the chemical freeze-out parameters at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}=$ 7.7--200 GeV and four different centralities. A significant finding was the decrease in the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ with light nuclei inclusion, with an even more pronounced reduction when considering light nuclei yields exclusively. This suggests that light nuclei formation occurs at a later stage in the system's evolution at RHIC energies. We present parameterized formulas that describe the energy dependence of $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ and the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ for three distinct particle sets in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. Our results reveal at least three distinct $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ at RHIC energies correspond to different freeze-out hypersurfaces: a light-flavor freeze-out temperature of $T_L$ = 150.2$\pm$6 MeV, a strange-flavor freeze-out temperature $T_s$ = 165.1$\pm$2.7 MeV, and a light-nuclei freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ln}}$ = 141.7$\pm$1.4 MeV. Notably, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Pb+Pb 2.76 TeV, the expected lower freeze-out temperature for light nuclei was not observed; instead, the $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ for light nuclei was found to be approximately 10 MeV higher than that for light-flavor hadrons.</description>

Abstract: Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a modification of general relativity proposed to explain galactic and cosmological mass discrepancies conventionally attributed to dark matter.~The theory is able to fit the cosmic microwave background and the linear matter power spectrum.~In this work, we derive the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this theory and solve it for realistic nuclear equations of state to predict the mass-radius relation of neutron stars.~We find solutions that are compatible with all current observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>SpectrAx: Spectral Search of Axion-Like Particles Using Multi-Band Observations of Galaxy Clusters from SKA, SO, CMB-S4 and eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of axions or Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) has been predicted by various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories, and the proposed photon-ALP interaction is one of the ways to probe them. Such an interaction will lead to photon-ALP resonant conversion in galaxy clusters, resulting in a polarized spectral distortion in the CMB along the cluster line of sight. The estimation of this signal from galaxy clusters requires an estimation of their electron density and magnetic field profiles, as well as their redshifts. We have developed a new Bayesian framework \texttt{SpectrAx} that can use observations from different electromagnetic bands such as radio, CMB, optical, and X-ray to infer the astrophysical properties of a galaxy cluster, such as cluster its redshift, electron density and magnetic field, along with the BSM physics such as ALPs. We use simulated redshifts in our analysis, but that can be obtained by cross-matching with optical surveys having overlapping sky regions with the galaxy clusters. Also, we use radial profiles that are motivated from observations of galaxy clusters at low redshifts. By using the simulated data corresponding to the ALP mass of $10^{-14}$ eV for upcoming CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 in combination with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) we demonstrate the capability in accurately inferring the ALPs coupling strength along with the radial profile of electron density and magnetic field from galaxy clusters. The application of this framework to the data from future surveys by combining SKA+SO+eROSITA and SKA+CMB-S4+eROSITA will make it possible for the first time to explore both astrophysics and BSM physics from low-redshift galaxy clusters using a multi-band approach.</description>

      <title>Large Field Polynomial Inflation in Palatini $f(R,\phi)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Palatini formalism to investigate the dynamics of large-field inflation using a renormalizable polynomial inflaton potential in the context of $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. Assuming instant reheating, we make a comparative analysis of large-field polynomial inflation (PI). We first consider the minimal and non-minimal coupling of inflaton in $R$ gravity, and then we continue with the minimally and non-minimally coupled inflaton in $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. We scan the parameter space for the inflationary predictions ($n_s$ and $r$) consistent with the Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 results as well as the sensitivity forecast of the future CMB-S4 and depict the compliant regions in the $\phi_0-\beta$ plane where $\phi_0$ and $\beta$ are two parameters of polynomial inflation model which control the saddle point of the potential and the flatness in the vicinity of this point respectively. We find that a substantial portion of the parameter space aligns with the observational data.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the asymptotic behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high order/power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only off-diagonally across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The latter are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of higher dimensional renormalized operators in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for a CP broken deconfined phase at $\theta =\pi$ in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory through simulations at imaginary $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills at $\theta=\pi$, which has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we provide a numerical evidence that the CP symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken at low temperature and it gets restored above the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, which is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the situation predicted in the large-$N$ limit. We avoid the severe sign problem by performing simulations at imaginary $\theta$. We obtain the critical temperature of the CP restoration and that of deconfinement at $\theta=\pi$ by analytic continuation, which leads to the above conclusion.</description>

Abstract: Kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter [($Y$+$K$) phase], which may be realized in neutron stars, is discussed on the basis of chiral symmetry. With the use of the effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon--baryon and kaon--kaon interactions; coupled with the relativistic mean field theory and universal three-baryon repulsive interaction, we clarify the effects of the $s$-wave kaon--baryon scalar interaction simulated by the kaon--baryon sigma terms and vector interaction (Tomozawa--Weinberg term) on kaon properties in hyperon-mixed matter, the onset density of kaon condensation, and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase. In particular, the quark condensates in the ($Y$+$K$) phase are obtained, and their relevance to chiral symmetry restoration is discussed.</description>
