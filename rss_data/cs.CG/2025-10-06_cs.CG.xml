      <title>Cellular Learning: Scattered Data Regression in High Dimensions via Voronoi Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a regression algorithm that provides a continuous, piecewise-smooth function approximating scattered data. It is based on composing and blending linear functions over Voronoi cells, and it scales to high dimensions. The algorithm infers Voronoi cells from seed vertices and constructs a linear function for the input data in and around each cell. As the algorithm does not explicitly compute the Voronoi diagram, it avoids the curse of dimensionality. An accuracy of around 98.2% on the MNIST dataset with 722,200 degrees of freedom (without data augmentation, convolution, or other geometric operators) demonstrates the applicability and scalability of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fast Witness Persistence for MRI Volumes via Hybrid Landmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a scalable witness-based persistent homology pipeline for full-brain MRI volumes that couples density-aware landmark selection with a GPU-ready witness filtration. Candidates are scored by a hybrid metric that balances geometric coverage against inverse kernel density, yielding landmark sets that shrink mean pairwise distances by 30-60% over random or density-only baselines while preserving topological features. Benchmarks on BrainWeb, IXI, and synthetic manifolds execute in under ten seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, avoiding the combinatorial blow-up of Cech, Vietoris-Rips, and alpha filtrations. The package is distributed on PyPI as whale-tda (installable via pip); source and issues are hosted at https://github.com/jorgeLRW/whale. The release also exposes a fast preset (mri_deep_dive_fast) for exploratory sweeps, and ships with reproducibility-focused scripts and artifacts for drop-in use in medical imaging workflows.</description>

      <title>Note on the Number of Almost Ordinary Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane, not all on a line. According to the Gallai-Sylvester
  theorem, $X$ always spans an \emph{ordinary line}, i.e., one that passes through precisely 2
  elements of $X$. Given an integer $c\ge 2,$ a \emph{line} spanned by $X$ is called
  \emph{$c$-ordinary} if it passes through at most $c$ points of $X$. A \emph{triangle} spanned by 3
  noncollinear points of $X$ is called \emph{$c$-ordinary} if all 3 lines determined by its sides
  are \emph{$c$-ordinary}. Motivated by a question of Erd\H os, Fulek \emph{et al.}~\cite{FMN+17}
  proved that there exists an absolute constant $c &gt; 2$ such that if $X$ cannot be covered by 2
  lines, then it determines at least one $c$-ordinary triangle. Moreover, the number of such
  triangles grows at least linearly in $n$. They raised the question whether the true growth rate of
  this function is superlinear.
  We prove that if $X$ cannot be covered by 2 lines, and no line passes through more than $n-t(n)$
  points of $X$, for some function $t(n)\rightarrow\infty,$ then the number of $17$-ordinary
  triangles spanned by $X$ is at least constant times $n \cdot t(n)$, i.e., superlinear in $n$. We also
  show that the assumption $t(n)\rightarrow\infty$ is necessary. If we further assume that no line
  passes through more than $n/2-t(n)$ points of $X$, then the number of $17$-ordinary triangles
  grows superquadratically in $n$. This statement does not hold if $t(n)$ is bounded. We close this
  paper with some algorithmic results. In particular, we provide a $O(n^{2.372})$ time algorithm for
  counting all $c$-ordinary triangles in an $n$-element point set, for any $c&lt;n$.</description>

      <title>Counting Triangulations of Fixed Cardinal Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fixed set of vertices in the plane may have multiple planar straight-line triangulations in which the degree of each vertex is the same. As such, the degree information does not completely determine the triangulation. We show that even if we know, for each vertex, the number of neighbors in each of the four cardinal directions, the triangulation is not completely determined. In fact, we show that counting such triangulations is #P-hard via a reduction from #3-regular bipartite planar vertex cover.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Space Lower Bound for Diameter Estimation in Dynamic Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the space complexity of estimating the diameter of a subset of points in an arbitrary metric space in the dynamic (turnstile) streaming model. The input is given as a stream of updates to a frequency vector $x \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n$, where the support of $x$ defines a multiset of points in a fixed metric space $M = ([n], \mathsf{d})$. The goal is to estimate the diameter of this multiset, defined as $\max\{\mathsf{d}(i,j) : x_i, x_j &gt; 0\}$, to a specified approximation factor while using as little space as possible.
  In insertion-only streams, a simple $O(\log n)$-space algorithm achieves a 2-approximation. In sharp contrast to this, we show that in the dynamic streaming model, any algorithm achieving a constant-factor approximation to diameter requires polynomial space. Specifically, we prove that a $c$-approximation to the diameter requires $n^{\Omega(1/c)}$ space. Our lower bound relies on two conceptual contributions: (1) a new connection between dynamic streaming algorithms and linear sketches for {\em scale-invariant} functions, a class that includes diameter estimation, and (2) a connection between linear sketches for diameter and the {\em minrank} of graphs, a notion previously studied in index coding. We complement our lower bound with a nearly matching upper bound, which gives a $c$-approximation to the diameter in general metrics using $n^{O(1/c)}$ space.</description>

      <title>Discrete scalar curvature as a weighted sum of Ollivier-Ricci curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between discrete analogues of Ricci and scalar curvature that are defined for point clouds and graphs. In the discrete setting, Ricci curvature is replaced by Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Scalar curvature can be computed as the trace of Ricci curvature for a Riemannian manifold; this motivates a new definition of a scalar version of Ollivier-Ricci curvature. We show that our definition converges to scalar curvature for nearest neighbor graphs obtained by sampling from a manifold. We also prove some new results about the convergence of Ollivier-Ricci curvature to Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success across various scientific fields, yet their adoption in critical decision-making is often hindered by a lack of interpretability. Recently, intrinsically interpretable GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs, and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs, balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.</description>

      <title>Minimum Star Partitions of Simple Polygons in Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise a polynomial-time algorithm for partitioning a simple polygon $P$ into a minimum number of star-shaped polygons. The question of whether such an algorithm exists has been open for more than four decades [Avis and Toussaint, Pattern Recognit., 1981] and it has been repeated frequently, for example in O'Rourke's famous book [Art Gallery Theorems and Algorithms, 1987]. In addition to its strong theoretical motivation, the problem is also motivated by practical domains such as CNC pocket milling, motion planning, and shape parameterization.
  The only previously known algorithm for a non-trivial special case is for $P$ being both monotone and rectilinear [Liu and Ntafos, Algorithmica, 1991]. For general polygons, an algorithm was only known for the restricted version in which Steiner points are disallowed [Keil, SIAM J. Comput., 1985], meaning that each corner of a piece in the partition must also be a corner of $P$. Interestingly, the solution size for the restricted version may be linear for instances where the unrestricted solution has constant size. The covering variant in which the pieces are star-shaped but allowed to overlap--known as the Art Gallery Problem--was recently shown to be $\exists\mathbb R$-complete and is thus likely not in NP [Abrahamsen, Adamaszek and Miltzow, STOC 2018 &amp; J. ACM 2022]; this is in stark contrast to our result. Arguably the most related work to ours is the polynomial-time algorithm to partition a simple polygon into a minimum number of convex pieces by Chazelle and Dobkin~[STOC, 1979 &amp; Comp. Geom., 1985].</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes (SCs) have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets often leads to dense SCs, with many higher-order simplicies, which results in prohibitive computational requirements in terms of time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes is thus of broad interest, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser surrogate SC (with typically only a log-linear number of simplices) that maintains the spectrum of the original SC as closely as possible. In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsification of SCs that uses so-called local densities of states. Using this local densities of states, we can efficiently approximate so-called generalized effective resistance of each simplex, which is proportional to the required sampling probability for the sparsification of the SC. To avoid degenerate structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a ``kernel-ignoring'' decomposition to approximate the sampling probability. Additionally, we utilize certain error estimates to characterize the asymptotic algorithmic complexity of the developed method. We demonstrate the performance of our framework on a family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.</description>
