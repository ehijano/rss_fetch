      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). I. Astrometric Noise and Planetary Detection Efficiency due to Stellar Spots and Faculae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) is dedicated to the astrometric exploration for habitable-zone Earth-like planets orbiting solar-type stars in close proximity, achieving unprecedented micro-arcsecond precision. Given the elevated precision, thorough consideration of photocenter jitters induced by stellar activity becomes imperative. This study endeavors to model the stellar activity of solar-type stars, compute astrometric noise, and delineate the detection limits of habitable planets within the astrometric domain. Simulations were conducted for identified primary targets of CHES, involving the generation of simulated observed data for astrometry and photometry, accounting for the impact of stellar activity. Estimation of activity levels in our samples was achieved through chromospheric activity indices, revealing that over 90% of stars exhibited photocenter jitters below 1 $\mu\mathrm{as}$. Notably, certain proximate stars, such as $\alpha$ Cen A and B, displayed more discernible noise arising from stellar activity. Subsequent tests were performed to evaluate detection performance, unveiling that stellar activity tends to have a less pronounced impact on planetary detectability for the majority of stars. Approximately 95% of targets demonstrated a detection efficiency exceeding 80%. However, for several cold stars, e.g., HD 32450 and HD 21531, with the habitable zones close to the stars, a reduction in detection efficiency was observed. These findings offer invaluable insights into the intricate interplay between stellar activity and astrometric precision, significantly advancing our understanding in the search for habitable planets.</description>

      <title>Identifying coronal sources of L1 solar wind disturbances using the Fisk heliospheric magnetic field and potential field extrapolations during three solar minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar minima between solar cycles 22-23, 23-24 and 24-25 are the best observed minima on record. In situ solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field measurements by the WIND and ACE spacecraft at L1 with one-hour cadence are explored using wavelet analyses for the most quiescent year during each minimum. Times of local peaks in periodicities are identified in the solar wind velocity, magnetic field components, and proton number densities. The measured radial velocities at these times are used to trace magnetic field lines to the photosphere using two models. The first is the Fisk heliospheric magnetic field that traces field lines from L1 to the photosphere. They connect exclusively to solar poles and in 88% instances to locations of polar coronal holes. The second model uses the Parker spiral to trace from L1 to the solar source surface and potential field extrapolations from the source surface to the photosphere. These field lines terminate at equatorial and mid-latitude coordinates of which some are located close to coronal holes. This study connects for the first time coronal hole signatures in the ecliptic plane at L1 with polar coronal holes using the Fisk field. It shows how sources from both the solar equator and poles influence the solar wind at L1 and how the two models compliment each other to identify these sources.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Parameters of Astrophysical Plasma Turbulence and its Dissipation: Nonrelativistic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A specific set of dimensionless plasma and turbulence parameters is introduced to characterize the nature of turbulence and its dissipation in weakly collisional space and astrophysical plasmas. Key considerations are discussed for the development of predictive models of the turbulent plasma heating that characterize the partitioning of dissipated turbulent energy between the ion and electron species and between the perpendicular and parallel degrees of freedom for each species. Identifying the kinetic physical mechanisms that govern the damping of the turbulent fluctuations is a critical first step in constructing such turbulent heating models. A set of ten general plasma and turbulence parameters are defined, and reasonable approximations along with the exploitation of existing scaling theories for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence are used to reduce this general set of ten parameters to just three parameters in the isotropic temperature case. A critical step forward in this study is to identify the dependence of all of the proposed kinetic mechanisms for turbulent damping in terms of the same set of fundamental plasma and turbulence parameters. Analytical estimations of the scaling of each damping mechanism on these fundamental parameters are presented, and this information is synthesized to produce the first phase diagram for the turbulent damping mechanisms as a function of driving scale and ion plasma beta.</description>
