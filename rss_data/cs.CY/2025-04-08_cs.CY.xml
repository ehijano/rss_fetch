      <title>Improved visual-information-driven model for crowd simulation and its modular application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven crowd simulation models offer advantages in enhancing the accuracy and realism of simulations, and improving their generalizability is essential for promoting application. Current data-driven approaches are primarily designed for a single scenario, with very few models validated across more than two scenarios. It is still an open question to develop data-driven crowd simulation models with strong generalizibility. We notice that the key to addressing this challenge lies in effectively and accurately capturing the core common influential features that govern pedestrians' navigation across diverse scenarios. Particularly, we believe that visual information is one of the most dominant influencing features. In light of this, this paper proposes a data-driven model incorporating a refined visual information extraction method and exit cues to enhance generalizability. The proposed model is examined on four common fundamental modules: bottleneck, corridor, corner and T-junction. The evaluation results demonstrate that our model performs excellently across these scenarios, aligning with pedestrian movement in real-world experiments, and significantly outperforms the classical knowledge-driven model. Furthermore, we introduce a modular approach to apply our proposed model in composite scenarios, and the results regarding trajectories and fundamental diagrams indicate that our simulations closely match real-world patterns in the composite scenario. The research outcomes can provide inspiration for the development of data-driven crowd simulation models with high generalizability and advance the application of data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Steve: LLM Powered ChatBot for Career Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancements in systems deploying large language models (LLMs), as well as improvements in their ability to act as agents with predefined templates, provide an opportunity to conduct qualitative, individualized assessments, creating a bridge between qualitative and quantitative methods for candidates seeking career progression. In this paper, we develop a platform that allows candidates to run AI-led interviews to assess their current career stage and curate coursework to enable progression to the next level. Our approach incorporates predefined career trajectories, associated skills, and a method to recommend the best resources for gaining the necessary skills for advancement. We employ OpenAI API calls along with expertly compiled chat templates to assess candidate competence. Our platform is highly configurable due to the modularity of the development, is easy to deploy and use, and available as a web interface where the only requirement is candidate resumes in PDF format. We demonstrate a use-case centered on software engineering and intend to extend this platform to be domain-agnostic, requiring only regular updates to chat templates as industries evolve.</description>

      <title>An Intelligent and Privacy-Preserving Digital Twin Model for Aging-in-Place</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of older adults is steadily increasing, with a strong preference for aging-in-place rather than moving to care facilities. Consequently, supporting this growing demographic has become a significant global challenge. However, facilitating successful aging-in-place is challenging, requiring consideration of multiple factors such as data privacy, health status monitoring, and living environments to improve health outcomes. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive sensor system designed for installation in older adults' homes. Using data from the sensors, our system constructs a digital twin, a virtual representation of events and activities that occurred in the home. The system uses neural network models and decision rules to capture residents' activities and living environments. This digital twin enables continuous health monitoring by providing actionable insights into residents' well-being. Our system is designed to be low-cost and privacy-preserving, with the aim of providing green and safe monitoring for the health of older adults. We have successfully deployed our system in two homes over a time period of two months, and our findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of digital twin technology in supporting independent living for older adults. This study highlights that our system could revolutionize elder care by enabling personalized interventions, such as lifestyle adjustments, medical treatments, or modifications to the residential environment, to enhance health outcomes.</description>

      <title>Scope of Online Maternal Health Information in Kinyarwanda and Opportunities for Digital Health Developers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maternal health literacy is associated with greater odds of positive pregnancy outcomes. There is an increasing proliferation of websites dedicated to maternal health education, but the scope and quality of their content varies widely. In this study, we analyzed the main topics covered on maternal health websites that offer content in the low-resource Kinyarwanda language (mainly spoken by 12 million Rwandans). We used web scraping to identify maternal health websites. We utilized a topic modeling, using the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm, to identify the topics. We found five main topics: (1) pregnancy danger signs, (2) child care, (3) intimacy (sex), (4) nutrition, and (5) the importance of doctor consultations. However, the articles were short and did not cater to fathers, pregnant adolescents, or those experiencing gender-based violence (GBV) or mental health challenges. This is despite 12.5\% women of reproductive age in Rwanda being victims of GBV and one in five women in low- and middle-income countries experiencing mental illness during the perinatal period. We recommend three automated tools, a topic recommender tool, culturally relevant automated articles, and website quality check tools, to guide software and health content developers.</description>

      <title>Arti-"fickle" Intelligence: Using LLMs as a Tool for Inference in the Political and Social Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) are incredibly useful, versatile, and promising tools. However, they will be of most use to political and social science researchers when they are used in a way that advances understanding about real human behaviors and concerns. To promote the scientific use of LLMs, we suggest that researchers in the political and social sciences need to remain focused on the scientific goal of inference. To this end, we discuss the challenges and opportunities related to scientific inference with LLMs, using validation of model output as an illustrative case for discussion. We propose a set of guidelines related to establishing the failure and success of LLMs when completing particular tasks, and discuss how we can make inferences from these observations. We conclude with a discussion of how this refocus will improve the accumulation of shared scientific knowledge about these tools and their uses in the social sciences.</description>

      <title>Bridging LMS and Generative AI: Dynamic Course Content Integration (DCCI) for Connecting LLMs to Course Content -- The Ask ME Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) has the potential to enhance task automation and accessibility in education. However, hallucination where LLMs generate inaccurate or misleading information remains a significant challenge. This study introduces the Dynamic Course Content Integration (DCCI) mechanism, which dynamically retrieves and integrates course content and curriculum from Canvas LMS into the LLM-powered assistant, Ask ME. By employing prompt engineering to structure retrieved content within the LLM's context window, DCCI ensures accuracy, relevance, and contextual alignment, mitigating hallucination. To evaluate DCCI's effectiveness, Ask ME's usability, and broader student perceptions of AI in education, a mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating user satisfaction ratings and a structured survey. Results from a pilot study indicate high user satisfaction (4.614/5), with students recognizing Ask ME's ability to provide timely and contextually relevant responses for both administrative and course-related inquiries. Additionally, a majority of students agreed that Ask ME's integration with course content in Canvas LMS reduced platform-switching, improving usability, engagement, and comprehension. AI's role in reducing classroom hesitation and fostering self-directed learning and intellectual curiosity was also highlighted. Despite these benefits and positive perception of AI tools, concerns emerged regarding over-reliance on AI, accuracy limitations, and ethical issues such as plagiarism and reduced student-teacher interaction. These findings emphasize the need for strategic AI implementation, ethical safeguards, and a pedagogical framework that prioritizes human-AI collaboration over substitution.</description>

      <title>Building a Village: A Multi-stakeholder Approach to Open Innovation and Shared Governance to Promote Youth Online Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SIGCHI and Social Computing research communities have been at the forefront of online safety efforts for youth, ranging from understanding the serious risks youth face online to developing evidence-based interventions for risk protection. Yet, to bring these efforts to bear, we must partner with practitioners, such as industry stakeholders who know how to bring such technologies to market, and youth service providers who work directly with youth. Therefore, we interviewed 33 stakeholders in the space of youth online safety, including industry professionals (n=12), youth service providers (n=11), and researchers (n=10) to understand where their visions toward working together to protect youth online converged and surfaced tensions, as well as how we might reconcile conflicting viewpoints to move forward as one community with synergistic expertise on how to change the current sociotechnical landscape for youth online safety. Overall, we found that non-partisan leadership is necessary to chart actionable, equitable goals to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders, combat feelings of isolation, and foster trust between the stakeholder groups. Based on these findings, we recommend the use of open-innovation methods with their inherent transparency, federated governance models, and clear but inclusive leadership structures to promote collaboration between youth online safety stakeholders. We propose the creation of an open-innovation organization that unifies the diverse voices in youth online safety to develop open-standards and evidence-based design patterns that centralize otherwise fragmented efforts that have fallen short of the goal of effective technological solutions that keep youth safe online.</description>

      <title>Stochastic, Dynamic, Fluid Autonomy in Agentic AI: Implications for Authorship, Inventorship, and Liability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, exemplified by OpenAI's DeepResearch, autonomously pursue goals, adapting strategies through implicit learning. Unlike traditional generative AI, which is reactive to user prompts, agentic AI proactively orchestrates complex workflows. It exhibits stochastic, dynamic, and fluid autonomy: its steps and outputs vary probabilistically (stochastic), it evolves based on prior interactions (dynamic), and it operates with significant independence within human-defined parameters, adapting to context (fluid). While this fosters complex, co-evolutionary human-machine interactions capable of generating uniquely synthesized creative outputs, it also irrevocably blurs boundaries--human and machine contributions become irreducibly entangled in intertwined creative processes. Consequently, agentic AI poses significant challenges to legal frameworks reliant on clear attribution: authorship doctrines struggle to disentangle ownership, intellectual property regimes strain to accommodate recursively blended novelty, and liability models falter as accountability diffuses across shifting loci of control. The central issue is not the legal treatment of human versus machine contributions, but the fundamental unmappability--the practical impossibility in many cases--of accurately attributing specific creative elements to either source. When retroactively parsing contributions becomes infeasible, applying distinct standards based on origin becomes impracticable. Therefore, we argue, legal and policy frameworks may need to treat human and machine contributions as functionally equivalent--not for moral or economic reasons, but as a pragmatic necessity.</description>

      <title>When Will AI Transform Society? Swedish Public Predictions on AI Development Timelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates public expectations regarding the likelihood and timing of major artificial intelligence (AI) developments among Swedes. Through a mixed-mode survey (web/paper) of 1,026 respondents, we examined expectations across six key scenarios: medical breakthroughs, mass unemployment, democratic deterioration, living standard improvements, artificial general intelligence (AGI), and uncontrollable superintelligent AI. Findings reveal strong consensus on AI-driven medical breakthroughs (82.6%), while expectations for other major developments are significantly lower, ranging from 40.9% for mass unemployment down to 28.4% for AGI. Timeline expectations varied significantly, with major medical advances anticipated within 6-10 years, while more transformative developments like AGI were projected beyond 20 years. Latent class analysis identified three distinct groups: optimists (46.7%), ambivalents (42.2%), and skeptics (11.2%). The optimist group showed higher levels of self-rated AI knowledge and education, while gender differences were also observed across classes. The study addresses a critical gap in understanding temporal expectations of AI development among the general public, offering insights for policymakers and stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Beyond Answers: How LLMs Can Pursue Strategic Thinking in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential in education, enabling personalized learning, enhancing inclusivity, and encouraging creativity and curiosity. In this paper, we explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as both patient tutors and collaborative partners to enhance education delivery. As tutors, LLMs personalize learning by offering step-by-step explanations and addressing individual needs, making education more inclusive for students with diverse backgrounds or abilities. As collaborators, they expand students' horizons, supporting them in tackling complex, real-world problems and co-creating innovative projects. However, to fully realize these benefits, LLMs must be leveraged not as tools for providing direct solutions but rather to guide students in developing resolving strategies and finding learning paths together. Therefore, a strong emphasis should be placed on educating students and teachers on the successful use of LLMs to ensure their effective integration into classrooms. Through practical examples and real-world case studies, this paper illustrates how LLMs can make education more inclusive and engaging while empowering students to reach their full potential.</description>

      <title>Simulating Persuasive Dialogues on Meat Reduction with Generative Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meat reduction benefits human and planetary health, but social norms keep meat central in shared meals. To date, the development of communication strategies that promote meat reduction while minimizing social costs has required the costly involvement of human participants at each stage of the process. We present work in progress on simulating multi-round dialogues on meat reduction between Generative Agents based on large language models (LLMs). We measure our main outcome using established psychological questionnaires based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and additionally investigate Social Costs. We find evidence that our preliminary simulations produce outcomes that are (i) consistent with theoretical expectations; and (ii) valid when compared to data from previous studies with human participants. Generative agent-based models are a promising tool for identifying novel communication strategies on meat reduction-tailored to highly specific participant groups-to then be tested in subsequent studies with human participants.</description>

      <title>Measuring the right thing: justifying metrics in AI impact assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI Impact Assessments are only as good as the measures used to assess the impact of these systems. It is therefore paramount that we can justify our choice of metrics in these assessments, especially for difficult to quantify ethical and social values. We present a two-step approach to ensure metrics are properly motivated. First, a conception needs to be spelled out (e.g. Rawlsian fairness or fairness as solidarity) and then a metric can be fitted to that conception. Both steps require separate justifications, as conceptions can be judged on how well they fit with the function of, for example, fairness. We argue that conceptual engineering offers helpful tools for this step. Second, metrics need to be fitted to a conception. We illustrate this process through an examination of competing fairness metrics to illustrate that here the additional content that a conception offers helps us justify the choice for a specific metric. We thus advocate that impact assessments are not only clear on their metrics, but also on the conceptions that motivate those metrics.</description>

      <title>A moving target in AI-assisted decision-making: Dataset shift, model updating, and the problem of update opacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are vulnerable to performance decline over time due to dataset shift. To address this problem, experts often suggest that ML systems should be regularly updated to ensure ongoing performance stability. Some scholarly literature has begun to address the epistemic and ethical challenges associated with different updating methodologies. Thus far, however, little attention has been paid to the impact of model updating on the ML-assisted decision-making process itself, particularly in the AI ethics and AI epistemology literatures. This article aims to address this gap in the literature. It argues that model updating introduces a new sub-type of opacity into ML-assisted decision-making -- update opacity -- that occurs when users cannot understand how or why an update has changed the reasoning or behaviour of an ML system. This type of opacity presents a variety of distinctive epistemic and safety concerns that available solutions to the black box problem in ML are largely ill-equipped to address. A variety of alternative strategies may be developed or pursued to address the problem of update opacity more directly, including bi-factual explanations, dynamic model reporting, and update compatibility. However, each of these strategies presents its own risks or carries significant limitations. Further research will be needed to address the epistemic and safety concerns associated with model updating and update opacity going forward.</description>

Abstract: This systematic review examines peer-reviewed studies on application of GPT in business management, revealing significant knowledge gaps. Despite identifying interesting research directions such as best practices, benchmarking, performance comparisons, social impacts, our analysis yields only 42 relevant studies for the 22 months since its release. There are so few studies looking at a particular sector or subfield that management researchers, business consultants, policymakers, and journalists do not yet have enough information to make well-founded statements on how GPT is being used in businesses. The primary contribution of this paper is a call to action for further research. We provide a description of current research and identify knowledge gaps on the use of GPT in business. We cover the management subfields of finance, marketing, human resources, strategy, operations, production, and analytics, excluding retail and sales. We discuss gaps in knowledge of GPT potential consequences on employment, productivity, environmental costs, oppression, and small businesses. We propose how management consultants and the media can help fill those gaps. We call for practical work on business control systems as they relate to existing and foreseeable AI-related business challenges. This work may be of interest to managers, to management researchers, and to people working on AI in society.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Clinical Decision Support through Multi-Agent Systems and Ethical AI Governance</title>

Abstract: In the age of data-driven medicine, it is paramount to include explainable and ethically managed artificial intelligence in explaining clinical decision support systems to achieve trustworthy and effective patient care. The focus of this paper is on a new architecture of a multi-agent system for clinical decision support that uses modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and the clinical context and then integrates these results to drive predictions and validate outcomes. We describe our implementation with the eICU database to run lab-analysis-specific agents, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners and then run the prediction module and a validation agent. Everything is a transparent implementation of business logic, influenced by the principles of ethical AI governance such as Autonomy, Fairness, and Accountability. It provides visible results that this agent-based framework not only improves on interpretability and accuracy but also on reinforcing trust in AI-assisted decisions in an intensive care setting.</description>

      <title>Ethical AI on the Waitlist: Group Fairness Evaluation of LLM-Aided Organ Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming ubiquitous, promising automation even in high-stakes scenarios. However, existing evaluation methods often fall short -- benchmarks saturate, accuracy-based metrics are overly simplistic, and many inherently ambiguous problems lack a clear ground truth. Given these limitations, evaluating fairness becomes complex. To address this, we reframe fairness evaluation using Borda scores, a method from voting theory, as a nuanced yet interpretable metric for measuring fairness. Using organ allocation as a case study, we introduce two tasks: (1) Choose-One and (2) Rank-All. In Choose-One, LLMs select a single candidate for a kidney, and we assess fairness across demographics using proportional parity. In Rank-All, LLMs rank all candidates for a kidney, reflecting real-world allocation processes. Since traditional fairness metrics do not account for ranking, we propose a novel application of Borda scoring to capture biases. Our findings highlight the potential of voting-based metrics to provide a richer, more multifaceted evaluation of LLM fairness.</description>

      <title>Misaligned Roles, Misplaced Images: Structural Input Perturbations Expose Multimodal Alignment Blind Spots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Language Models (MMLMs) typically undergo post-training alignment to prevent harmful content generation. However, these alignment stages focus primarily on the assistant role, leaving the user role unaligned, and stick to a fixed input prompt structure of special tokens, leaving the model vulnerable when inputs deviate from these expectations. We introduce Role-Modality Attacks (RMA), a novel class of adversarial attacks that exploit role confusion between the user and assistant and alter the position of the image token to elicit harmful outputs. Unlike existing attacks that modify query content, RMAs manipulate the input structure without altering the query itself. We systematically evaluate these attacks across multiple Vision Language Models (VLMs) on eight distinct settings, showing that they can be composed to create stronger adversarial prompts, as also evidenced by their increased projection in the negative refusal direction in the residual stream, a property observed in prior successful attacks. Finally, for mitigation, we propose an adversarial training approach that makes the model robust against input prompt perturbations. By training the model on a range of harmful and benign prompts all perturbed with different RMA settings, it loses its sensitivity to Role Confusion and Modality Manipulation attacks and is trained to only pay attention to the content of the query in the input prompt structure, effectively reducing Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the model's general utility.</description>

      <title>POE-$\Delta$: a framework for change engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many organisational problems are addressed through systemic change and re-engineering of existing Information Systems rather than radical new design. In the face of widespread IT project failure, devising effective ways to tackle this type of change remains an open challenge. This work discusses the motivation, theoretical foundation, characteristics and evaluation of a novel framework - referred to as POE-$\Delta$, which is rooted in design and engineering and is aimed at providing systematic support for representing, structuring and exploring change problems of a socio-technical nature, including implementing their solutions when they exist. We generalise an existing framework of greenfield design as problem solving for application to change problems. From a theoretical perspective,POE-$\Delta$ is a strict extension to its parent framework, allowing the seamless integration of greenfield and brownfield design to tackle change problems.
  A Design Science Research methodology was applied over a decade to define and evaluate POE-$\Delta$, with significant case study research conducted to evaluate the framework in its application to real-world change problems of varying criticality and complexity. The results show that POE-$\Delta$ exhibits desirable characteristics of a design approach to organisational change and can bring tangible benefits when applied in practice as a holistic and systematic approach to change in socio-technical contexts.</description>

      <title>What Large Language Models Do Not Talk About: An Empirical Study of Moderation and Censorship Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as gateways to information, yet their content moderation practices remain underexplored. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs refuse to answer or omit information when prompted on political topics. To do so, we distinguish between hard censorship (i.e., generated refusals, error messages, or canned denial responses) and soft censorship (i.e., selective omission or downplaying of key elements), which we identify in LLMs' responses when asked to provide information on a broad range of political figures. Our analysis covers 14 state-of-the-art models from Western countries, China, and Russia, prompted in all six official United Nations (UN) languages. Our analysis suggests that although censorship is observed across the board, it is predominantly tailored to an LLM provider's domestic audience and typically manifests as either hard censorship or soft censorship (though rarely both concurrently). These findings underscore the need for ideological and geographic diversity among publicly available LLMs, and greater transparency in LLM moderation strategies to facilitate informed user choices. All data are made freely available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's digital era, the Internet, especially social media platforms, plays a significant role in shaping public opinions, attitudes, and beliefs. Unfortunately, the credibility of scientific information sources is often undermined by the spread of misinformation through various means, including technology-driven tools like bots, cyborgs, trolls, sock-puppets, and deep fakes. This manipulation of public discourse serves antagonistic business agendas and compromises civil society. In response to this challenge, a new scientific discipline has emerged: social cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>AdvKT: An Adversarial Multi-Step Training Framework for Knowledge Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) monitors students' knowledge states and simulates their responses to question sequences. Existing KT models typically follow a single-step training paradigm, which leads to discrepancies with the multi-step inference process required in real-world simulations, resulting in significant error accumulation. This accumulation of error, coupled with the issue of data sparsity, can substantially degrade the performance of recommendation models in the intelligent tutoring systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Adversarial Multi-Step Training Framework for Knowledge Tracing (AdvKT), which, for the first time, focuses on the multi-step KT task. More specifically, AdvKT leverages adversarial learning paradigm involving a generator and a discriminator. The generator mimics high-reward responses, effectively reducing error accumulation across multiple steps, while the discriminator provides feedback to generate synthetic data. Additionally, we design specialized data augmentation techniques to enrich the training data with realistic variations, ensuring that the model generalizes well even in scenarios with sparse data. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of AdvKT over existing KT models, showcasing its ability to address both error accumulation and data sparsity issues effectively.</description>

      <title>Teaching Data Science Students to Sketch Privacy Designs through Heuristics (Extended Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies reveal that experienced data practitioners often draw sketches to facilitate communication around privacy design concepts. However, there is limited understanding of how we can help novice students develop such communication skills. This paper studies methods for lowering novice data science students' barriers to creating high-quality privacy sketches. We first conducted a need-finding study (N=12) to identify barriers students face when sketching privacy designs. We then used a human-centered design approach to guide the method development, culminating in three simple, text-based heuristics. Our user studies with 24 data science students revealed that simply presenting three heuristics to the participants at the beginning of the study can enhance the coverage of privacy-related design decisions in sketches, reduce the mental effort required for creating sketches, and improve the readability of the final sketches.</description>

      <title>MedGNN: Capturing the Links Between Urban Characteristics and Medical Prescriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how urban socio-demographic and environmental factors relate with health is essential for public health and urban planning. However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and more broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance transdisciplinary public health research.</description>

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-driven tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), is reshaping professional writing. Still, key aspects of their adoption such as languages support, ethics, and long-term impact on writers voice and creativity remain underexplored. In this work, we conducted a questionnaire (N = 301) and an interactive survey (N = 36) targeting professional writers regularly using AI. We examined LLM-assisted writing practices across 25+ languages, ethical concerns, and user expectations. The findings of the survey demonstrate important insights, reflecting upon the importance of: LLMs adoption for non-English speakers; the degree of misinformation, domain and style adaptation; usability and key features of LLMs. These insights can guide further development, benefiting both writers and a broader user base.</description>

      <title>Addressing Label Leakage in Knowledge Tracing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is concerned with predicting students' future performance on learning items in intelligent tutoring systems. Learning items are tagged with skill labels called knowledge concepts (KCs). Many KT models expand the sequence of item-student interactions into KC-student interactions by replacing learning items with their constituting KCs. This approach addresses the issue of sparse item-student interactions and minimises the number of model parameters. However, we identified a label leakage problem with this approach. The model's ability to learn correlations between KCs belonging to the same item can result in the leakage of ground truth labels, which leads to decreased performance, particularly on datasets with a high number of KCs per item.
  In this paper, we present methods to prevent label leakage in knowledge tracing (KT) models. Our model variants that utilize these methods consistently outperform their original counterparts. This further underscores the impact of label leakage on model performance. Additionally, these methods enhance the overall performance of KT models, with one model variant surpassing all tested baselines on different benchmarks. Notably, our methods are versatile and can be applied to a wide range of KT models.</description>

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) pose significant risks, particularly in the realm of online election interference. This paper explores the nefarious applications of GenAI, highlighting their potential to disrupt democratic processes through deepfakes, botnets, targeted misinformation campaigns, and synthetic identities. By examining recent case studies and public incidents, we illustrate how malicious actors exploit these technologies to try influencing voter behavior, spread disinformation, and undermine public trust in electoral systems. The paper also discusses the societal implications of these threats, emphasizing the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies and international cooperation to safeguard democratic integrity.</description>

      <title>Identity-related Speech Suppression in Generative AI Content Moderation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated content moderation has long been used to help identify and filter undesired user-generated content online. Generative AI systems now use such filters to keep undesired generated content from being created by or shown to users. From classrooms to Hollywood, as generative AI is increasingly used for creative or expressive text generation, whose stories will these technologies allow to be told, and whose will they suppress? In this paper, we define and introduce measures of speech suppression, focusing on speech related to different identity groups incorrectly filtered by a range of content moderation APIs. Using both short-form, user-generated datasets traditional in content moderation and longer generative AI-focused data, including two datasets we introduce in this work, we create a benchmark for measurement of speech suppression for nine identity groups. Across one traditional and four generative AI-focused automated content moderation services tested, we find that identity-related speech is more likely to be incorrectly suppressed than other speech. We find differences in identity-related speech suppression for traditional versus generative AI data, with APIs performing better on generative AI data but worse on longer text instances, and by identity, with identity-specific reasons for incorrect flagging behavior. Overall, we find that on traditional short-form data incorrectly suppressed speech is likely to be political, while for generative AI creative data it is likely to be television violence.</description>

      <title>Combining Threat Intelligence with IoT Scanning to Predict Cyber Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the Web has become a global platform for communication; malicious actors, including hackers and hacktivist groups, often disseminate ideological content and coordinate activities through the "Dark Web" an obscure counterpart of the conventional web. Presently, challenges such as information overload and the fragmented nature of cyber threat data impede comprehensive profiling of these actors, thereby limiting the efficacy of predictive analyses of their online activities. Concurrently, the proliferation of internet-connected devices has surpassed the global human population, with this disparity projected to widen as the Internet of Things (IoT) expands. Technical communities are actively advancing IoT-related research to address its growing societal integration. This paper proposes a novel predictive threat intelligence framework designed to systematically collect, analyze, and visualize Dark Web data to identify malicious websites and correlate this information with potential IoT vulnerabilities. The methodology integrates automated data harvesting, analytical techniques, and visual mapping tools, while also examining vulnerabilities in IoT devices to assess exploitability. By bridging gaps in cybersecurity research, this study aims to enhance predictive threat modeling and inform policy development, thereby contributing to intelligence research initiatives focused on mitigating cyber risks in an increasingly interconnected digital ecosystem.</description>

      <title>MLLM-as-a-Judge for Image Safety without Human Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image content safety has become a significant challenge with the rise of visual media on online platforms. Meanwhile, in the age of AI-generated content (AIGC), many image generation models are capable of producing harmful content, such as images containing sexual or violent material. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify such unsafe images based on established safety rules. Pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential in this regard, given their strong pattern recognition abilities. Existing approaches typically fine-tune MLLMs with human-labeled datasets, which however brings a series of drawbacks. First, relying on human annotators to label data following intricate and detailed guidelines is both expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, users of safety judgment systems may need to frequently update safety rules, making fine-tuning on human-based annotation more challenging. This raises the research question: Can we detect unsafe images by querying MLLMs in a zero-shot setting using a predefined safety constitution (a set of safety rules)? Our research showed that simply querying pre-trained MLLMs does not yield satisfactory results. This lack of effectiveness stems from factors such as the subjectivity of safety rules, the complexity of lengthy constitutions, and the inherent biases in the models. To address these challenges, we propose a MLLM-based method includes objectifying safety rules, assessing the relevance between rules and images, making quick judgments based on debiased token probabilities with logically complete yet simplified precondition chains for safety rules, and conducting more in-depth reasoning with cascaded chain-of-thought processes if necessary. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is highly effective for zero-shot image safety judgment tasks.</description>

      <title>Critical Mathematical Economics and Progressive Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06015v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present elements and discuss the potential of a research program at the intersection between mathematics and heterodox economics, which we call Criticial Mathematical Economics (CME). We propose to focus on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and aim at providing an entrance to the literature as an invitation to mathematicians that are potentially interested in such a project.
  From our point of view, mathematics has been partly misused in mainstream economics to justify `unregulated markets'. We identify two key parts of CME, which leads to a natural structure of this article: The first part focusses on an analysis and critique of mathematical models used in mainstream economics, like e.g. the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) in Macroeconomics and the so-called ``Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu''-Theorems.
  The aim of the second part is to improve and extend heterodox models using ingredients from modern mathematics and computer science, a method with strong relation to Complexity Economics. We exemplify this idea by describing how methods from Non-Linear Dynamics have been used in Post-Keynesian Macroeconomics', and also discuss (Pseudo-) Goodwin cycles and possible Micro- and Mesofoundations.
  Finally, we outline in which areas a collaboration between mathematicians and heterodox economists could be most promising, and discuss both existing projects in such a direction as well as areas where new models for policy advice are most needed. In an outlook, we discuss the role of (ecological) data, and the need for what we call Progressive Data Science.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Ethical Insider Threat Detection through Data Synthesis and Analysis by LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insider threats wield an outsized influence on organizations, disproportionate to their small numbers. This is due to the internal access insiders have to systems, information, and infrastructure. %One example of this influence is where anonymous respondents submit web-based job search site reviews, an insider threat risk to organizations. Signals for such risks may be found in anonymous submissions to public web-based job search site reviews. This research studies the potential for large language models (LLMs) to analyze and detect insider threat sentiment within job site reviews. Addressing ethical data collection concerns, this research utilizes synthetic data generation using LLMs alongside existing job review datasets. A comparative analysis of sentiment scores generated by LLMs is benchmarked against expert human scoring. Findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate alignment with human evaluations in most cases, thus effectively identifying nuanced indicators of threat sentiment. The performance is lower on human-generated data than synthetic data, suggesting areas for improvement in evaluating real-world data. Text diversity analysis found differences between human-generated and LLM-generated datasets, with synthetic data exhibiting somewhat lower diversity. Overall, the results demonstrate the applicability of LLMs to insider threat detection, and a scalable solution for insider sentiment testing by overcoming ethical and logistical barriers tied to data acquisition.</description>

      <title>Superhuman Game AI Disclosure: Expertise and Context Moderate Effects on Trust and Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence surpasses human performance in select tasks, disclosing superhuman capabilities poses distinct challenges for fairness, accountability, and trust. However, the impact of such disclosures on diverse user attitudes and behaviors remains unclear, particularly concerning potential negative reactions like discouragement or overreliance. This paper investigates these effects by utilizing Persona Cards: a validated, standardized set of synthetic personas designed to simulate diverse user reactions and fairness perspectives. We conducted an ethics board-approved study (N=32), utilizing these personas to investigate how capability disclosure influenced behaviors with a superhuman game AI in competitive StarCraft II scenarios. Our results reveal transparency is double-edged: while disclosure could alleviate suspicion, it also provoked frustration and strategic defeatism among novices in cooperative scenarios, as well as overreliance in competitive contexts. Experienced and competitive players interpreted disclosure as confirmation of an unbeatable opponent, shifting to suboptimal goals. We release the Persona Cards Dataset, including profiles, prompts, interaction logs, and protocols, to foster reproducible research into human alignment AI design. This work demonstrates that transparency is not a cure-all; successfully leveraging disclosure to enhance trust and accountability requires careful tailoring to user characteristics, domain norms, and specific fairness objectives.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Technology Job Market: Data Driven Analysis of 3641 Job Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.</description>

      <title>I'm Sorry Dave: How the old world of personnel security can inform the new world of AI insider risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organisations are rapidly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) tools to perform tasks previously undertaken by people. The potential benefits are enormous. Separately, some organisations deploy personnel security measures to mitigate the security risks arising from trusted human insiders. Unfortunately, there is no meaningful interplay between the rapidly evolving domain of AI and the traditional world of personnel security. This is a problem. The complex risks from human insiders are hard enough to understand and manage, despite many decades of effort. The emerging security risks from AI insiders are even more opaque. Both sides need all the help they can get. Some of the concepts and approaches that have proved useful in dealing with human insiders are also applicable to the emerging risks from AI insiders.</description>
