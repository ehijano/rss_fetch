      <title>On the local thermodynamic relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate, by providing two specific examples, that the local differential thermodynamic relations used as educated guesses in relativistic hydrodynamics with spin, do not hold even at global thermodynamic equilibrium, where the expression of the entropy current is totally unambiguous. We show, by using a rigorous quantum statistical method, that for massless free fermions and massive free fermions with rotation and acceleration at global thermodynamic equilibrium, the derivative of the pressure function with respect to the spin potential differs from the spin density and acquires a correction of the same order. Therefore, for an accurate determination of the constitutive relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, the traditional method of assuming differential thermodynamic relations is not appropriate.</description>

      <title>Relativistic spin hydrodynamics with antisymmetric spin tensors and an extension of the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a formulation of relativistic spin hydrodynamics with totally antisymmetric spin tensors that satisfy the Frenkel-Mathisson-Pirani condition. In our proposed spin hydrodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled by the spin-induced corrections in the heat flow, the viscous tensor, and the antisymmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor. These corrections are interpreted as the inverse spin Hall effect and the anomalous Hall effect in the nonrelativistic limit. We show that our evolution equation for the spin density is interpreted as an extension of the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation known in relativistic many-body systems, including the Thomas precession term, the spin-rotation term, and new coupling terms between spin and hydrodynamic variables.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound of QCD matter at chiral crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach to thermodynamics of QCD motivated by cluster decomposition we present a unified equation of state of hot strongly interacting matter and analyze its properties in a wide range of temperatures. The hadrons are treated as color singlet multiquark clusters in medium with a background gluon field in the Polyakov gauge. The confining aspect of QCD is accounted for by the Polyakov loop mechanism and by a large vacuum quark mass motivated by a confining density functional approach. We demonstrate that an abrupt switching between hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, which is one of striking manifestations of dynamical restoration of chiral symmetry, is accompanied by a smooth behavior of entropy density at chiral crossover. Individual contributions of different components of strongly interacting matter to its speed of sound are analyzed for the first time. It is shown that restoration of chiral symmetry drives speed of sound of hadron gas to negative values, manifesting its mechanical instability and being in a strike disagreements with the lattice QCD data. Accounting for the partonic excitations naturally resolves this contradiction.</description>

      <title>Iterative Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd quantum algorithm for solving resonances with eigenvector continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving nuclear resonances, which is based on the iterative Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and eigenvector continuation with complex scaling. To validate this approach, we compute the resonant states of $\alpha-\alpha$ system and achieve results in good agreement with traditional methods. Our study offers a new perspective on calculating eigenvalues of non-Hermitian operators and lays some groundwork for further exploration of nuclear resonances using quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Proto-neutron Stars with Dark Matter Admixture: A Single-Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of dark matter (DM) on the microscopic and macroscopic properties of proto-neutron stars (PNSs). We employ a single-fluid framework in which DM interacts with ordinary matter (OM) via the Higgs portal and remains in thermal equilibrium through non-gravitational interactions. Using a quasi-static approximation, we analyze the evolution of PNSs during the Kelvin--Helmholtz phase by varying the DM mass while keeping the entropy per baryon and lepton fraction fixed. Our results show that DM absorbs thermal energy from the stellar medium without efficient re-emission, thereby altering neutrino emission and affecting the star's thermal evolution history. Furthermore, neutrinos contribute significantly to pressure support in the PNS phase, inhibiting DM mass accretion during neutrino-trapped stages. Based on the requirement to satisfy the observed $2\,\rm M_\odot$ neutron star mass constraint and to maintain consistency with supernova remnant data, we suggest an upper limit of $m_\chi \leq 0.62\,\rm GeV$ for the DM mass that can accrete in evolving PNSs. In contrast, we established that cold neutron stars (NSs) can support higher DM masses without compromising equilibrium stability, owing to increased central density, enhanced gravitational binding energy, and reduced thermal pressure.</description>

      <title>Linear sigma model with quarks and Polyakov loop in rotation: phase diagrams, Tolman-Ehrenfest law and mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of rotation on the confining and chiral properties of QCD using the Polyakov-enhanced linear sigma model coupled to quarks. Working in the homogeneous approximation, we obtain the phase diagram at finite temperature, baryon density and angular frequency, taking into account the causality constraint enforced by the spectral boundary conditions at a cylindrical surface. We explicitly address various limits with respect to system size $R$, angular frequency $\Omega$ and chemical potential $\mu$. We demonstrate that, in this model, the critical temperatures of both transitions diminish in response to the increasing rotation, being in contradiction with the first-principle lattice results. We demonstrate that consistency between the thermodynamics of the model and the Tolman-Ehrenfest law is achieved in the limit of large volume. We also compute the mechanical characteristics of rotating plasma, such as the moment of inertia and the $K_n$ shape coefficients describing the response of the thermodynamic potential with respect to the increase of angular velocity $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Rapidly spinning dark matter-admixed neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>Improved Honeycomb and Hyperhoneycomb Lattice Hamiltonians for Quantum Simulations of Non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improved Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonians for quantum simulations of non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theories are developed for honeycomb (2+1D) and hyperhoneycomb (3+1D) spatial tessellations. This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements. We have identified the (non-chiral) hyperhoneycomb as a candidate spatial tessellation for 3+1D quantum simulations of gauge theories, and determined the associated ${\cal O}(b)$-improved Hamiltonian.</description>
