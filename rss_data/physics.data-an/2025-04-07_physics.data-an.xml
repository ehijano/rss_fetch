      <title>Effect of Nonlinear Surface Inflows into Activity Belts on Solar Cycle Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Converging flows are visible around bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) on the solar surface, according to observations. Average flows are created by these inflows combined, and the strength of these flows depends on the amount of flux present during the solar cycle. In models of the solar cycle, this average flow can be depicted as perturbations to the meridional flow. In this article, we study the effects of introducing surface inflow to the surface flux transport models (SFT) as a possible nonlinear mechanism in the presence of latitude quenching for an inflow profile whose amplitude varies within a cycle depending on the magnetic activity. The results show that including surface inflows in the model in the presence of both LQ and tilt quenching (TQ) produced a polar field within a $\pm$1$\sigma$ of an average cycle polar field ($\sigma$ is the standard deviation) and a correlation coefficient of 0.85. We confirm that including inflows produces a lower net contribution to the dipole moment (10\,--\,25\%). Furthermore, the relative importance of LQ vs. inflows is inversely correlated with the dynamo effectivity range ($\lambda_{R}$). With no decay term, introducing inflows into the model resulted in a less significant net contribution to the dipole moment. Including inflows in the SFT model shows a possible nonlinear relationship between the surface inflows and the solar dipole moment, suggesting a potential nonlinear mechanism contributing to the saturation of the global dynamo. For lower $\lambda_R$ ($\lessapprox$ 10 $^\circ$), TQ always dominates LQ, and for higher $\lambda_R$ LQ dominate. However, including inflows will make the domination a little bit earlier in case of having a decay term in the model.</description>

      <title>The AI Cosmologist I: An Agentic System for Automated Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the AI Cosmologist, an agentic system designed to automate cosmological/astronomical data analysis and machine learning research workflows. This implements a complete pipeline from idea generation to experimental evaluation and research dissemination, mimicking the scientific process typically performed by human researchers. The system employs specialized agents for planning, coding, execution, analysis, and synthesis that work together to develop novel approaches. Unlike traditional auto machine-learning systems, the AI Cosmologist generates diverse implementation strategies, writes complete code, handles execution errors, analyzes results, and synthesizes new approaches based on experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the AI Cosmologist capabilities across several machine learning tasks, showing how it can successfully explore solution spaces, iterate based on experimental results, and combine successful elements from different approaches. Our results indicate that agentic systems can automate portions of the research process, potentially accelerating scientific discovery. The code and experimental data used in this paper are available on GitHub at https://github.com/adammoss/aicosmologist. Example papers included in the appendix demonstrate the system's capability to autonomously produce complete scientific publications, starting from only the dataset and task description</description>

      <title>Physics-informed 4D X-ray image reconstruction from ultra-sparse spatiotemporal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented X-ray flux density provided by modern X-ray sources offers new spatiotemporal possibilities for X-ray imaging of fast dynamic processes. Approaches to exploit such possibilities often result in either i) a limited number of projections or spatial information due to limited scanning speed, as in time-resolved tomography, or ii) a limited number of time points, as in stroboscopic imaging, making the reconstruction problem ill-posed and unlikely to be solved by classical reconstruction approaches. 4D reconstruction from such data requires sample priors, which can be included via deep learning (DL). State-of-the-art 4D reconstruction methods for X-ray imaging combine the power of AI and the physics of X-ray propagation to tackle the challenge of sparse views. However, most approaches do not constrain the physics of the studied process, i.e., a full physical model. Here we present 4D physics-informed optimized neural implicit X-ray imaging (4D-PIONIX), a novel physics-informed 4D X-ray image reconstruction method combining the full physical model and a state-of-the-art DL-based reconstruction method for 4D X-ray imaging from sparse views. We demonstrate and evaluate the potential of our approach by retrieving 4D information from ultra-sparse spatiotemporal acquisitions of simulated binary droplet collisions, a relevant fluid dynamic process. We envision that this work will open new spatiotemporal possibilities for various 4D X-ray imaging modalities, such as time-resolved X-ray tomography and more novel sparse acquisition approaches like X-ray multi-projection imaging, which will pave the way for investigations of various rapid 4D dynamics, such as fluid dynamics and composite testing.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation for networks of coupled oscillators: Inferring unknown model parameters from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the state and unknown parameters of a network of coupled oscillators is of utmost importance. This task is made harder when only partial and noisy observations are available, which is a typical scenario in realistic high-dimensional systems. The general task of inference falls under data assimilation, and a commonly used assimilation method is the Ensemble Kalman Filter. Employing network-specific localization of the forecast covariance, an Ensemble Kalman Filter with state space augmentation is shown to yield highly accurate estimates of both the oscillator phases and unknown model parameters in the case where only a subset of oscillator phases are observed. In contrast, standard data assimilation methods yield poor results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for Kuramoto oscillators and for networks of theta neurons, using a variety of network topologies.</description>

      <title>Stochastic reduced-order Koopman model for turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stochastic data-driven reduced-order model applicable to a wide range of turbulent natural and engineering flows is presented. Combining ideas from Koopman theory and spectral model order reduction, the stochastic low-dimensional inflated convolutional Koopman model (SLICK) accurately forecasts short-time transient dynamics while preserving long-term statistical properties. A discrete Koopman operator is used to evolve convolutional coordinates that govern the temporal dynamics of spectral orthogonal modes, which in turn represent the energetically most salient large-scale coherent flow structures. Turbulence closure is achieved in two steps: first, by inflating the convolutional coordinates to incorporate nonlinear interactions between different scales, and second, by modeling the residual error as a stochastic source. An empirical dewhitening filter informed by the data is used to maintain the second-order flow statistics within the long-time limit. The model uncertainty is quantified through either Monte Carlo simulation or by directly propagating the model covariance matrix. The model is demonstrated on the Ginzburg-Landau equations, large-eddy simulation (LES) data of a turbulent jet, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) data of the flow over an open cavity. In all cases, the model is predictive over time horizons indicated by a detailed error analysis and integrates stably over arbitrary time horizons, generating realistic surrogate data.</description>
