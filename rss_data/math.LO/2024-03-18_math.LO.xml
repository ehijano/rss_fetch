      <title>Fregean Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I humbly introduce a concept I call "Fregean flows," a graph theoretic representation of classical logic, to show how higher-dimensional graph characteristics might be useful to prove or perhaps at best show the provability of simple deductive statements typically represented as one-dimensional strings of characters. I apply these to a very simple proof, namely proving the equivalence of two definitions for an Abelian group G, an if-and-only-if statement, using a re-representation of statements as vertices and both conjunctions and implications as differently coloured edges. This re-representation of an if-and-only-if is simple but shows unexpected geometry, and I discuss its possible utility in terms of provability through ideas of graph topology, similarities of graph contraction to deductive elimination, and recursion.</description>

      <title>Almost sure OTM-realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining the approaches made in works with Galeotti and Passmann, we define and study a notion of "almost sure" realizability with parameter-free ordinal Turing machines (OTMs). In particular, we show that, in contrast to the classical case, almost sure realizability differs from plain realizability, while closure under intuitionistic predicate logic and realizability of Kripke-Platek set theory continue to hold.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We delve into the concept of categories with products that distribute over coproducts, which we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. We show various instances of doubly-infinitary distributive categories aiming for a comparative analysis with established notions such as extensivity, infinitary distributiveness, and cartesian closedness. Our exploration reveals that this condition represents a substantial extension beyond the classical understanding of infinitary distributive categories. Our main theorem establishes that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed. We end the paper with remarks on non-canonical isomorphisms, open questions, and future work.</description>

Abstract: There is an irreparable error in the proof of Theorem 3.26 in our "Model Theory of Fields with Virtually Free Group Actions" paper and we withdraw the claim of having proved that theorem. In fact, that theorem is false in a very strong sense.</description>

      <title>A Note on OTM-Realizability and Constructive Set Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.08945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an ordinalized version of Kleene's realizability interpretation of intuitionistic logic by replacing Turing machines with Koepke's ordinal Turing machines (OTMs), thus obtaining a notion of realizability applying to arbitrary statements in the language of set theory. We observe that every instance of the axioms of intuitionistic first-order logic are OTM-realizable and consider the question which axioms of Friedman's Intuitionistic Set Theory (IZF) and Aczel's Constructive Set Theory (CZF) are OTM-realizable.
  This is an introductory note, and proofs are mostly only sketched or omitted altogether. It will soon be replaced by a more elaborate version.</description>

      <title>A universal characterization of standard Borel spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.10510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the category $\mathsf{SBor}$ of standard Borel spaces is the (bi-)initial object in the 2-category of countably complete Boolean (countably) extensive categories. This means that $\mathsf{SBor}$ is the universal category admitting some familiar algebraic operations of countable arity (e.g., countable products, unions) obeying some simple compatibility conditions (e.g., products distribute over disjoint unions). More generally, for any infinite regular cardinal $\kappa$, the dual of the category $\kappa\mathsf{Bool}_\kappa$ of $\kappa$-presented $\kappa$-complete Boolean algebras is (bi-)initial in the 2-category of $\kappa$-complete Boolean ($\kappa$-)extensive categories.</description>

      <title>Structural, point-free, non-Hausdorff topological realization of Borel groupoid actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Becker--Kechris topological realization and change-of-topology theorems for Polish group actions in several directions. For Polish group actions, we prove a single result that implies the original Becker--Kechris theorems, as well as Sami's and Hjorth's sharpenings adapted levelwise to the Borel hierarchy; automatic continuity of Borel actions via homeomorphisms; and the equivalence of "potentially open" versus "orbitwise open" Borel sets. We also characterize "potentially open" $n$-ary relations, thus yielding a topological realization theorem for invariant Borel first-order structures. We then generalize to groupoid actions, and prove a result subsuming Lupini's Becker--Kechris-type theorems for open Polish groupoids, newly adapted to the Borel hierarchy, as well as topological realizations of actions on fiberwise topological bundles and bundles of first-order structures.
  Our proof method is new even in the classical case of Polish groups, and is based entirely on formal algebraic properties of category quantifiers; in particular, we make no use of either metrizability or the strong Choquet game. Consequently, our proofs work equally well in the non-Hausdorff context, for open quasi-Polish groupoids, and more generally in the point-free context, for open localic groupoids.</description>

      <title>Qualitative reasoning in a two-layered framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reasoning with qualitative uncertainty measures involves comparative statements about events in terms of their likeliness without necessarily assigning an exact numerical value to these events. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, we formalise reasoning with the qualitative counterparts of capacities, belief functions, and probabilities, within the framework of two-layered logics. Namely, we provide two-layered logics built over the classical propositional logic using a unary belief modality $\Be$ that connects the inner layer to the outer one where the reasoning is formalised by means of G\"{o}del logic. We design their Hilbert-style axiomatisations and prove their completeness. In the second part, we discuss the paraconsistent generalisations of the logics for qualitative uncertainty that take into account the case of the available information being contradictory or inconclusive.</description>

      <title>SB-property on metric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complete theory $T$ has the Schr\"oder-Bernstein property or simply the SB-property if any pair of elementarily bi-embeddable models are isomorphic. This property has been studied in the discrete first-order setting and can be seen as a first step towards classification theory. This paper deals with the SB-property on continuous theories. Examples of complete continuous theories that have this property include Hilbert spaces and any completion of the theory of probability algebras. We also study a weaker notion, the SB-property up to perturbations. This property holds if any two elementarily bi-embeddable models are isomorphic up to perturbations. We prove that the theory of Hilbert spaces expanded with a bounded self-adjoint operator has the SB-property up to perturbations of the operator and that the theory of atomless probability algebras with a generic automorphism have the SB-property up to perturbations of the automorphism. We also study how the SB-property behaves with respect to randomizations. Finally we prove, in the continuous setting, that if $T$ is a strictly stable theory then $T$ does not have the SB-property.</description>

      <title>Low level definability above large cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some connections between definability in generalized descriptive set theory and large cardinals, particularly measurable cardinals and limits thereof, working in ZFC. We show that if $\kappa$ is a limit of measurable cardinals then there is no $\Sigma_1(H_\kappa\cup\mathrm{OR})$ wellorder of a subset of $P(\kappa)$ of length $\geq\kappa^+$; this answers a question of L\"ucke and M\"uller. However, in $M_1$, the minimal proper class mouse with a Woodin cardinal, for every uncountable cardinal $\kappa$ which is not a limit of measurables, there is a $\Sigma_1(H_\kappa\cup\{\kappa\})$ good wellorder of $H_{\kappa^+}$. If $\kappa$ is a limit of measurables then there is no $\Sigma_1(H_\kappa\cup\mathrm{OR})$ mad family $F\subseteq P(\kappa)$ of cardinality $&gt;\kappa$, and if also $\mathrm{cof}(\kappa)&gt;\omega$ then there is no $\Sigma_1(H_\kappa\cup\mathrm{OR})$ almost disjoint family $F\subseteq P(\kappa)$ of cardinality $&gt;\kappa$. However, relative to the consistency of large cardinals, $\Pi_1(\{\kappa\})$ mad families and maximal independent families $F\subseteq P(\kappa)$ can exist, when $\kappa$ is a limit of measurables, and even more. We also examine some of the features of $L[U]$, and answer another question of L\"ucke and M\"uller, showing that if $\kappa$ is a weakly compact cardinal such that every $\Sigma_1(H_\kappa\cup\{\kappa\})$ subset of $P(\kappa)$ of cardinality $&gt;\kappa$ has a subset which is the range of a perfect function, then there is an inner model satisfying "there is a weakly compact limit of measurable cardinals".</description>

      <title>Universal Algebra in UniMath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.05952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our library for Universal Algebra in the UniMath framework dealing with multi-sorted signatures, their algebras, and the basics for equation systems. We show how to implement term algebras over a signature without resorting to general inductive constructions (currently not allowed in UniMath) still retaining the computational nature of the definition. We prove that our single sorted ground term algebras are instances of homotopy W-types. From this perspective, the library enriches UniMath with a computationally well-behaved implementation of a class of W-types. Moreover, we give neat constructions of the univalent categories of algebras and equational algebras by using the formalism of displayed categories, and show that the term algebra over a signature is the initial object of the category of algebras. Finally, we showcase the computational relevance of our work by sketching some basic examples from algebra and propositional logic.</description>
