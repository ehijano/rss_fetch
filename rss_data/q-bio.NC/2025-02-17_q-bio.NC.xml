      <title>Theory of enhanced-by-coincidence neural information transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The activity of neurons within brain circuits has been ubiquitously reported to be correlated. The impact of these correlations on brain function has been extensively investigated. Correlations can in principle increase or decrease the information that neural populations carry about sensory stimuli, but experiments in cortical areas have mostly reported information-limiting correlations, which decrease the information encoded in the population. However, a second stream of evidence suggests that temporal correlations between the spiking activity of different neurons may increase the impact of neural activity downstream, implying that temporal correlations affect both the encoding of information and its downstream readout. The principle of how encoding and readout combine are still unclear. Here, we consider a model of transmission of stimulus information encoded in pre-synaptic input spike trains with information-limiting time-correlations to the output firing of a post-synaptic biologicaly-plausible leaky integrate and fire (LIF) readout neuron. We derive an analytical solution of the model in the diffusion approximation, in which the encoding spiking activity is treated as a continuous-time stochastic variable. An ansatz based on a separation of timescales allows us compute the stimulus information transmitted to the readout over a broad range of parameters. Our analytical results reveal that, for sufficiently low input firing rates, large enough difference in input stimulus-specific activity, and moderately large input temporal correlations, the stimulus discriminability of the firing of the LIF readout neuron can be enhanced by the presence of input time correlations, despite they decrease the stimulus information encoded in its inputs.</description>

      <title>Structuring the Environment Nudges Participants Toward Hierarchical Over Shortest Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective planning is crucial for navigating complex environments and achieving goals efficiently. In this study, we investigated how environmental structure influences the selection of planning strategies. Participants navigated a space station to collect colored spheres, with environments either structured (spheres grouped by color) or unstructured (spheres scattered randomly). We tested three types of plans: hierarchical (grouping spheres by color), shortest path (minimizing travel distance), and neutral (none of the above). By manipulating environmental structure, we were able to nudge participants toward a preference for hierarchical planning in structured environments, while shortest path plans were favored in unstructured environments. A mismatch between self-reported preferences and actual choices indicated that participants often adopted implicit strategies, unaware of their decision-making processes. These findings highlight the powerful effect of environmental cues on planning and suggest that even subtle changes in structure can guide the selection of planning strategies.</description>

      <title>NeuroXVocal: Detection and Explanation of Alzheimer's Disease through Non-invasive Analysis of Picture-prompted Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through non invasive methods remains a significant healthcare challenge. We present NeuroXVocal, a novel dual-component system that not only classifies but also explains potential AD cases through speech analysis. The classification component (Neuro) processes three distinct data streams: acoustic features capturing speech patterns and voice characteristics, textual features extracted from speech transcriptions, and precomputed embeddings representing linguistic patterns. These streams are fused through a custom transformer-based architecture that enables robust cross-modal interactions. The explainability component (XVocal) implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, leveraging Large Language Models combined with a domain-specific knowledge base of AD research literature. This architecture enables XVocal to retrieve relevant clinical studies and research findings to generate evidence-based context-sensitive explanations of the acoustic and linguistic markers identified in patient speech. Using the IS2021 ADReSSo Challenge benchmark dataset, our system achieved state-of-the-art performance with 95.77% accuracy in AD classification, significantly outperforming previous approaches. The explainability component was qualitatively evaluated using a structured questionnaire completed by medical professionals, validating its clinical relevance. NeuroXVocal's unique combination of high-accuracy classification and interpretable, literature-grounded explanations demonstrates its potential as a practical tool for supporting clinical AD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Human foraging strategies flexibly adapt to resource distribution and time constraints</title>

Abstract: Foraging is a crucial activity, yet the extent to which humans employ flexible versus rigid strategies remains unclear. This study investigates how individuals adapt their foraging strategies in response to resource distribution and foraging time constraints. For this, we designed a video-game-like foraging task that requires participants to navigate a four-areas environment to collect coins from treasure boxes within a limited time. This task engages multiple cognitive abilities, such as navigation, learning, and memorization of treasure box locations. Findings indicate that participants adjust their foraging strategies -- encompassing both stay-or-leave decisions, such as the number of boxes opened in initial areas and behavioral aspects, such as the time to navigate from box to box -- depending on both resource distribution and foraging time. Additionally, they improved their performance over time as an effect of both enhanced navigation skills and adaptation of foraging strategies. Finally, participants' performance was initially distant from the reward-maximizing performance of optimal agents due to the learning process humans undergo; however, it approximated the optimal agent's performance towards the end of the task, without fully reaching it. These results highlight the flexibility of human foraging behavior and underscore the importance of employing optimality models and ecologically rich scenarios to study foraging.</description>

      <title>The shape of the brain's connections is predictive of cognitive performance: an explainable machine learning study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15108</link>

Abstract: The shape of the brain's white matter connections is relatively unexplored in diffusion MRI tractography analysis. While it is known that tract shape varies in populations and across the human lifespan, it is unknown if the variability in dMRI tractography-derived shape may relate to the brain's functional variability across individuals. This work explores the potential of leveraging tractography fiber cluster shape measures to predict subject-specific cognitive performance. We implement machine learning models to predict individual cognitive performance scores. We study a large-scale database from the HCP-YA study. We apply an atlas-based fiber cluster parcellation to the dMRI tractography of each individual. We compute 15 shape, microstructure, and connectivity features for each fiber cluster. Using these features as input, we train a total of 210 models to predict 7 different NIH Toolbox cognitive performance assessments. We apply an explainable AI technique, SHAP, to assess the importance of each fiber cluster for prediction. Our results demonstrate that shape measures are predictive of individual cognitive performance. The studied shape measures, such as irregularity, diameter, total surface area, volume, and branch volume, are as effective for prediction as microstructure and connectivity measures. The overall best-performing feature is a shape feature, irregularity, which describes how different a cluster's shape is from an idealized cylinder. Further interpretation using SHAP values suggest that fiber clusters with features highly predictive of cognitive ability are widespread throughout the brain, including fiber clusters from the superficial association, deep association, cerebellar, striatal, and projection pathways. This study demonstrates the strong potential of shape descriptors to enhance the study of the brain's white matter and its relationship to cognitive function.</description>

      <title>A Relative Homology Theory of Representation in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which the network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define the equivalence class of inputs $\sim_\Phi$, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the overlap decomposition $O_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and the input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to relative homology groups $H_k(\Phi(M)) \simeq H_k(M,O_\Phi)$. This lets us compute Betti numbers without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our relative homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on various classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.</description>
