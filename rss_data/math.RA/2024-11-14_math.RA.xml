      <title>On linear equations over split octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over an algebraically closed field, affine varieties of solutions of the linear equations a(xb)=c and a(bx)=c over split octonions are described. The set of solutions of a general linear monomial equation over split octonions is considered. We also study how the dimension of the set of solutions is changed under the degeneration of a linear equation.</description>

      <title>Projective Banach Lie bialgebras, the projective Yang-Baxter equation and projective Poisson Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the notion of projective Banach Lie bialgebras as the projective tensor product analogue of Banach Lie bialgebras. Then we consider the completion of the classical Yang-Baxter equation and classical r-matrices, and propose the notions of the projective Yang-Baxter equation and projective r-matrices. As in the finite-dimensional case, we prove that every quasi-triangular projective r-matrix gives rise to a projective Banach Lie bialgebra. Next adapting Poisson Banach-Lie groups to the projective tensor product setting, we propose the notion of projective Banach Poisson-Lie groups and show that the differentiation of a projective Banach Poisson-Lie group has the projective Banach Lie bialgebra structure. Finally considering bounded $\mathcal{O}$-operators on Banach Lie algebras, we give an equivalent description of triangular projective r-matrices.</description>

      <title>Maximal root subsystems of affine reflection systems and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any maximal root subsystem of a finite crystallographic reduced root system is either a closed root subsystem or its dual is a closed root subsystem in the dual root system. In this article, we classify the maximal root subsystems of an affine reflection system (reduced and non-reduced) and prove that this result holds in much more generality for reduced affine reflection systems. Moreover, we explicitly determine when a maximal root subsystem is a maximal closed root subsystem. Using our classification, at the end, we characterize the maximal root systems of affine reflection systems with nullity less than or equal to $2$ using Hermite normal forms; especially for Saito's EARS of nullity $2.$ This in turn classifies the maximal subgroups of the Weyl group of an affine reflection system that are generated by reflections.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous quadratic Lie super algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we state a version of the double extension for homogeneous quadratic Lie super algebras that includes even and odd cases. We prove that any indecomposable, non-simple and homogeneous quadratic Lie super algebra is obtained by means of this type of double extension. We also show that with this construction we can recover previously studied cases as well as some other which can not be recover with former versions of double extensions.</description>

      <title>Extended Shuffle Product for Multiple Zeta Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shuffle product on positive integer points, which corresponds to the shuffle algebra for multiple zeta values, is extended uniquely to all integer points, by making the linear operator which decreases the first entry by one a differential operator. We then show that all convergent integer points form a subalgebra under this extended shuffle product. By lifting the extended shuffle product to the locality algebra of Chen symbols, we prove that the multiple zeta series defines an algebra homomorphism from the subalgebra of convergent points to real numbers, which shows that the extended shuffle product is a structure for convergent integer points.</description>

      <title>On the Terwilliger algebra of the group association scheme of the symmetric group $\operatorname {sym}(7)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terwilliger algebras are finite-dimensional semisimple algebras that were first introduced by Paul Terwilliger in 1992 in studies of association schemes and distance-regular graphs. The Terwilliger algebras of the conjugacy class association schemes of the symmetric groups $\operatorname {sym}(n)$, for $3\leq n \leq 6$, have been studied and completely determined. The case for $\operatorname {sym}(7)$ is computationally much more difficult and has a potential application to find the size of the largest permutation codes of $\operatorname {sym}(7)$ with a minimal distance of at least $4$. In this paper, the dimension, the Wedderburn decomposition, and the block dimension decomposition of the Terwilliger algebra of the conjugacy class scheme of the group $\operatorname {sym}(7)$ are determined.</description>

      <title>The Mittag-Leffler condition descents via pure monomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This notes aims to clarify the proof given by Raynaud and Gruson that the Mittag-Leffler property descents via pure rings monomorphism of commutative rings. A consequence of that is that projectivity dencents via such ring homomorphisms, a revision of the proof also allows to prove that the property of being pure-projective also descents via pure monomorphisms between commutative rings}.</description>

      <title>The fork and its role in unification of closure algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16824v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-pronged fork frame $F$ and the variety $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ generated by its dual closure algebra $B_F$. We describe the finite projective algebras in $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ and give a purely semantic proof that unification in $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ is finitary and not unitary.</description>

      <title>Colimits of Heyting Algebras through Esakia Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we generalize the construction, due to Ghilardi, of the free Heyting algebra generated by a finite distributive lattice, to the case of arbitrary distributive lattices. Categorically, this provides an explicit construction of a left adjoint to the inclusion of Heyting algebras in the category of distributive lattices This is shown to have several applications, both old and new, in the study of Heyting algebras: (1) it allows a more concrete description of colimits of Heyting algebras, as well as, via duality theory, limits of Esakia spaces, by knowing their description over distributive lattices and Priestley spaces; (2) It allows a direct proof of the amalgamation property for Heyting algebras, and of related facts; (3) it allows a proof of the fact that the category of Heyting algebras is co-distributive. We also study some generalizations and variations of this construction to different settings. First, we analyse some subvarieties of Heyting algebras -- such as Boolean algebras, $\mathsf{KC}$ and $\mathsf{LC}$ algebras, and show how the construction can be adapted to this setting. Second, we study the relationship between the category of image-finite posets with p-morphisms and the category of posets with monotone maps, showing that a variation of the above ideas provides us with an appropriate general idea.</description>
