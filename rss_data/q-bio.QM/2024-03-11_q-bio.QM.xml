      <title>The temperature affects the impact levels of synthetic insecticides on a parasitoid wasp used in the biological control of pentatomid pests in soybean crops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of climate change has led to growing global concern about the interaction of temperature and xenobiotics in agricultural toxicological studies. Thus, for the first time, we evaluated the lethal, sublethal and transgerational effects of six insecticides used in the management of stink bug complex in soybean crops on the different life stages of the parasitoid Telenomus podisi (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) in three temperature levels (15, 25 and 30 {\deg}C). Telenomus podisi adults (F0 generation), when exposed to insecticides based on acephate, spinosad and thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin, showed accumulated mortality of 100% at all temperature levels tested. On the other hand, methoxyfenozide + spinetoram caused average mortalities of 88.75% at 15 {\deg}C and 38.75% at 25 and 30 {\deg}C. In contrast, the mortality rates caused by chlorfenapyr at 15, 25 and 30 {\deg}C were 1.25, 71.25 and 71.25%. On the other hand, surviving adults in lethal toxicity bioassay did not show differences in egg parasitism (F0 generation) and emergence of F1 generation in all temperature levels studied; however, the insecticide methoxyfenozide + spinetoram showed the lowest level of parasitism and emergence of T. podisi. In addition, our results demonstrated significant changes in the proportion of emerged males and females as the temperature increased; however, we did not find any differences when comparing the insecticides studied. Furthermore, we detected a significant interaction between insecticides and temperatures by contaminating the host's parasitized eggs (parasitoid pupal stage). Generally, the highest emergence reduction values were found at the highest temperature studied (30 {\deg}C). Our results highlighted the temperature-dependent impact of synthetic insecticides on parasitoids, which should be considered in toxicological risk assessments and under predicted climate change scenarios.</description>

      <title>Not all tickets are equal and we know it: Guiding pruning with domain-specific knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural structure learning is of paramount importance for scientific discovery and interpretability. Yet, contemporary pruning algorithms that focus on computational resource efficiency face algorithmic barriers to select a meaningful model that aligns with domain expertise. To mitigate this challenge, we propose DASH, which guides pruning by available domain-specific structural information. In the context of learning dynamic gene regulatory network models, we show that DASH combined with existing general knowledge on interaction partners provides data-specific insights aligned with biology. For this task, we show on synthetic data with ground truth information and two real world applications the effectiveness of DASH, which outperforms competing methods by a large margin and provides more meaningful biological insights. Our work shows that domain specific structural information bears the potential to improve model-derived scientific insights.</description>

      <title>The Michaelis--Menten reaction at low substrate concentrations: Pseudo-first-order kinetics and conditions for timescale separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Michaelis-Menten reaction mechanism can be accurately approximated by a linear system when the initial substrate concentration is low. This leads to pseudo-first-order kinetics, simplifying mathematical calculations and experimental analysis. Our proof utilizes a monotonicity property of the system and Kamke's comparison theorem. This linear approximation yields a closed-form solution, enabling accurate modeling and estimation of reaction rate constants even without timescale separation. Building on prior work, we establish that the sufficient condition for the validity of this approximation is $s_0 \ll K$, where $K=k_2/k_1$ is the Van Slyke-Cullen constant. This condition is independent of the initial enzyme concentration. Further, we investigate timescale separation within the linear system, identifying necessary and sufficient conditions and deriving the corresponding reduced one-dimensional equations.</description>

      <title>Mixed Models with Multiple Instance Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting patient features from single-cell data can help identify cellular states implicated in health and disease. Linear models and average cell type expressions are typically favored for this task for their efficiency and robustness, but they overlook the rich cell heterogeneity inherent in single-cell data. To address this gap, we introduce MixMIL, a framework integrating Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), upholding the advantages of linear models while modeling cell state heterogeneity. By leveraging predefined cell embeddings, MixMIL enhances computational efficiency and aligns with recent advancements in single-cell representation learning. Our empirical results reveal that MixMIL outperforms existing MIL models in single-cell datasets, uncovering new associations and elucidating biological mechanisms across different domains.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Interpretable Data-Driven Models for Early Prediction of Antimicrobial Multidrug Resistance Using Multivariate Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) is an inherently multimodal register of the patient's health status characterized by static data and multivariate time series (MTS). While MTS are a valuable tool for clinical prediction, their fusion with other data modalities can possibly result in more thorough insights and more accurate results. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as fundamental tools for identifying and defining underlying patterns in the healthcare domain. However, fundamental improvements in interpretability are needed for DNN models to be widely used in the clinical setting. In this study, we present an approach built on a collection of interpretable multimodal data-driven models that may anticipate and understand the emergence of antimicrobial multidrug resistance (AMR) germs in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada (Madrid, Spain). The profile and initial health status of the patient are modeled using static variables, while the evolution of the patient's health status during the ICU stay is modeled using several MTS, including mechanical ventilation and antibiotics intake. The multimodal DNNs models proposed in this paper include interpretable principles in addition to being effective at predicting AMR and providing an explainable prediction support system for AMR in the ICU. Furthermore, our proposed methodology based on multimodal models and interpretability schemes can be leveraged in additional clinical problems dealing with EHR data, broadening the impact and applicability of our results.</description>
