      <title>Tracking Dynamical Transitions using Link Density of Recurrence Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Link Density (LD) computed from the Recurrence Network (RN) of a time series data as an effective measure that can detect dynamical transitions in a system. We illustrate its use using time series from the standard Rossler system in the period doubling transitions and the transition to chaos. Moreover, we find that the standard deviation of LD can be more effective in highlighting the transition points. We also consider the variations in data when the parameter of the system is varying due to internal or intrinsic perturbations but at a time scale much slower than that of the dynamics. In this case also, the measure LD and its standard deviation correctly detect transition points in the underlying dynamics of the system. The computation of LD requires minimal computing resources and time, and works well with short data sets. Hence, we propose this measure as a tool to track transitions in dynamics from data, facilitating quicker and more effective analysis of large number of data sets.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Part Similarity for Goal-Guided Accelerated Experiment Design in Metal Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing is gaining broad interest and increased use in the industrial and academic fields. However, the quantification and commercialization of standard parts usually require extensive experiments and expensive post-characterization, which impedes the rapid development and adaptation of metal AM technologies. In this work, a similarity-based acceleration (S-acceleration) method for design of experiments is developed to reduce the time and costs associated with unveiling process-property (porosity defects) relationships during manufacturing. With S-acceleration, part semantic features from machine-setting parameters and physics-effects informed characteristics are explored for measuring mutual part similarities. A user-defined simplification rate of experiments is proposed to purposely remove redundant parts before conducting experiments printing without sacrificing information gain as original full factorial experiment design. This S-acceleration design of experiments is demonstrated on a Concept Laser M2 machine for the experimental plan of modeling relationships between process parameters and part porosity defects. The printed part has 2 mm diameter by 4 mm tall pin geometry considering variations in build location and orientation, laser settings and powder feedstock are held constant. In total, 242 parts are measured to create a ground truth data set of porosity levels by using X-ray tomography microscopy. The S-acceleration method is assessed for performance considering 40%, 50%, and 60% of user-defined experiment simplification rates. The repeated experiments are removed without ignoring the minority experiments outlier, assuring a similar process-property relation in the original experiment plan. The experiment number is significantly reduced based on part similarity with minimal compromise of model accuracy and obtained knowledge.</description>

      <title>Photon Classification with Gradient Boosted Trees at CLAS12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dihadron semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) of 10.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electrons off the proton has been measured using the CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab. Two separate channels, $\pi^+\pi^0$ and $\pi^-\pi^0$, were analyzed, requiring the reconstruction of diphoton pairs. In this analysis, we addressed the problem of false neutral particles being reconstructed by CLAS12's event builder, polluting the otherwise physical combinatorial background underneath the $\pi^0$ peak. A photon classifier using a Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs) architecture was trained with Monte Carlo simulations to reduce the amount of background $\pi^0$'s. We show that the nearest-neighbor features learned by the model lead to a substantial increase in signal vs. background discrimination compared to previous CLAS12 $\pi^0$ analyses. The machine learning approach recovers several times more dihadron statistics for the dataset.</description>
