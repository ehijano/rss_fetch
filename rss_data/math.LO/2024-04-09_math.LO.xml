      <title>Equivalence of multiset-based consequence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pioneering work of Blok and J\'onsson and its further development by Galatos and Tsinakis initiated an abstract study of consequence relations using the tools of module theory, where consequence relations over all types of syntactic objects are put on an equal footing. However, the assumption that in a consequence relation the premises form merely a set, as opposed to a more complicated structure, is still retained. An attempt to extend this framework to account for inferentially substructural generalizations of consequence relations, where the premises have the structure of a finite multiset, was recently made by Cintula, Gil-F\'erez, Moraschini, and Paoli. In this paper, we develop a different inferentially substructural generalization of the work of Galatos and Tsinakis, where we instead assume that the premises have the structure of a set of finite multisets. This leads a somewhat smoother framework which, unlike that of Cintula et al., covers the original theory of Galatos and Tsinakis as a special case.</description>

      <title>Levin's and Prucnal's theorems on Medvedev's logic of finite problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to provide a transparent and unified retelling of both Skvortsov's proof of the structural completeness of Medvedev's logic of finite problems, which is a classical result originally due to Prucnal, and of Levin's proof that Medvedev's logic of finite problems is the largest extension of the (weak) Kreisel-Putnam logic with the disjunction property. Presenting both results together allows us to simplify their presentation, as they both hinge on the same lemma. There is no novel content in this note, its purpose is merely to present the material in a more accessible way.</description>

      <title>Classification properties for some ternary structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a model-theoretic classification of the countable homogeneous $\mathbf{H}_4$-free 3-hypertournament studied by Cherlin, Hubi\v{c}ka, Kone\v{c}n\'y, and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. Our main result is that the theory of this structure is $\mathrm{SOP}_3$, $\mathrm{TP}_2$, and $\mathrm{NSOP}_4$. We offer two proofs of this fact: one is a direct proof, and the other employs part of the abstract machinery recently developed by Mutchnik.</description>

      <title>The Isomorphism Problem for Oligomorphic Groups with Weak Elimination of Imaginaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [21] it was asked if equality on the reals is sharp as a lower bound for the complexity of topological isomorphism between oligomorphic groups. We prove that under the assumption of weak elimination of imaginaries this is indeed the case. Our methods are model theoretic and they also have applications on the classical problem of reconstruction of isomorphisms of permutation groups from (topological) isomorphisms of automorphisms groups. As a concrete application, we give an explicit description of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{GL}(V))$ for any vector space $V$ of dimension $\aleph_0$ over a finite field, in affinity with the classical description for finite dimensional spaces due to Schreier and van der Waerden.</description>

      <title>Sets and Classes: Operational Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this book is to lay out certain aspects of descriptive set theory. After initially establishing notation and generalities we proceed to the following topics: partitions, semirings, rings, $\sigma$-rings, $\delta$-rings, products and sums, extension and generation. Extensive references and historical comments are included at the end of each section, as are further examples in the form of exercises and problems.</description>

      <title>On the unification problem for GLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the polymodal provability logic GLP, in a language with at least two modalities and one variable, has nullary unification type. More specifically, we show that the formula [1]p does not have maximal unifiers, and exhibit an infinite complete set of unifiers for it. Further, we discuss the algorithmic problem of whether a given formula is unifiable in GLP and remark that this problem has a positive solution. Finally, we state the arithmetical analogues of the unification and admissibility problems for GLP and formulate a number of open questions.</description>

      <title>Toward the van Benthem Characterization Theorem for Non-Distributive Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the simulations and bisimulations on polarity-based semantics for non-distributive modal logic, which are natural generalizations of those notions on Kripke semantics for modal logic. We also generalize other important model-theoretic notions about Kripke semantics such as image-finite models, modally-saturated models, ultrafilter extension and ultrapower extension to the non-distributive setting. By using these generalizations, we prove the Hennessy-Milner theorem and the van Benthem characterization theorem for non-distributive modal logic based on polarity-based semantics.</description>

      <title>On the first-order theories of quaternions and octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the language of rings. We provide an axiomatization of the $L$-theories of quaternions and octonions and we characterize the models of mentioned theories: they coincide, up to isomorphism, to quaternion and octonion algebras over a real closed field, respectively. We prove these theories are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis slice they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of the zero locus of ordered polynomials from completeness and we prove the failure of qantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas as well.</description>

      <title>Function spaces for orbit-finite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbit-finite sets are a generalisation of finite sets, and as such support many operations allowed for finite sets, such as pairing, quotienting, or taking subsets. However, they do not support function spaces, i.e. if X and Y are orbit-finite sets, then the space of finitely supported functions from X to Y is not orbit-finite. In this paper we propose two solutions to this problem: one is obtained by generalising the notion of orbit-finite set, and the other one is obtained by restricting it. In both cases, function spaces and the original closure properties are retained. Curiously, both solutions are "linear": the generalisation is based on linear algebra, while the restriction is based on linear logic.</description>

Abstract: Strongly dependent ordered abelian groups have finite dp-rank. They are precisely those groups with finite spines and $|\{p\text{ prime}:[G:pG]=\infty\}|&lt;\infty$. We apply this to show that if $K$ is a strongly dependent field, then $(K,v)$ is strongly dependent for any henselian valuation $v$.</description>

Abstract: We study dependence and independence concepts found in quantum physics, especially those related to hidden variables and non-locality, through the lens of team semantics and probabilistic team semantics, adapting a relational framework introduced by the first author in a prior paper. This leads to new developments also in independence logic and probabilistic independence logic.</description>

      <title>Model-completeness and decidability of the additive structure of integers expanded with a function for a Beatty sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.01673v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a recursive model-complete theory which completely axiomatizes the structure $Z_{\alpha}=(Z, +, 0, 1, f)$ where $f : x \to \lfloor{\alpha} x \rfloor $ is a unary function with ${\alpha}$ a fixed transcendental number.When {\alpha}$ is computable, our theory is recursively enumerable, and hence decidable as a result of completeness. Therefore, this result fits into the more general theme of adding traces of multiplication to integers without losing decidability.</description>

      <title>On groups interpretable in various valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite groups interpretable in three families of valued fields: $V$-minimal, power bounded $T$-convex, and $p$-adically closed fields. We show that every such group $G$ has unbounded exponent and that if $G$ is dp-minimal then it is abelian-by-finite.
  Along the way, we associate with any infinite interpretable group an infinite type-definable subgroup which is definably isomorphic to a group in one of four distinguished sorts: the underlying valued field $K$, its residue field $\mathbf{k}$ (when infinite), its value group $\Gamma$, or $K/\mathcal{O}$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the valuation ring.
  Our work uses and extends techniques developed in [11] to circumvent elimination of imaginaries.</description>

      <title>Every countable model of arithmetic or set theory has a pointwise-definable end extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the math tea argument, there must be real numbers that we cannot describe or define, because there are uncountably many real numbers, but only countably many definitions. And yet, the existence of pointwise-definable models of set theory, in which every individual is definable without parameters, challenges this conclusion. In this article, I introduce a flexible new method for constructing pointwise-definable models of arithmetic and set theory, showing furthermore that every countable model of Zermelo-Fraenkel ZF set theory and of Peano arithmetic PA has a pointwise-definable end extension. In the arithmetic case, I use the universal algorithm and its $\Sigma_n$ generalizations to build a progressively elementary tower making any desired individual $a_n$ definable at each stage $n$, while preserving these definitions through to the limit model, which can thus be arranged to be pointwise definable. A similar method works in set theory, and one can moreover achieve $V=L$ in the extension or indeed any other suitable theory holding in an inner model of the original model, thereby fulfilling the resurrection phenomenon. For example, every countable model of ZF with an inner model with a measurable cardinal has an end extension to a pointwise-definable model of $\text{ZFC}+V=L[\mu]$.</description>

      <title>Pointed lattice subreducts of varieties of residuated lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the pointed lattice subreducts of varieties of residuated lattices (RLs) and commutative residuated lattices (CRLs), i.e. lattice subreducts expanded by the constant 1 denoting the multiplicative unit. Given any positive universal class of pointed lattices K satisfying a certain equation, we describe the pointed lattice subreducts of semi-K and of pre-K RLs and CRLs. The quasivariety of semi-prime-pointed lattices generated by pointed lattices with a join prime constant 1 plays an important role here. In particular, the pointed lattices reducts of integral (semiconic) RLs and CRLs are precisely the integral (semiconic) semi-prime-pointed lattices. We also describe the pointed lattice subreducts of integral cancellative CRLs, proving in \mbox{particular} that every lattice is a subreduct of some integral cancellative CRL. This resolves an open problem about cancellative CRLs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some topics about \L o\'s's theorem without assuming the Axiom of Choice. We prove that \L o\'s's fundamental theorem of ultraproducts is equivalent to a weak form that every ultrapower is elementary equivalent to its source structure. On the other hand, it is consistent that there is a structure $M$ and an ultrafilter $U$ such that the ultrapower of $M$ by $U$ is elementary equivalent to $M$, but the fundamental theorem for the ultrapower of $M$ by $U$ fails. We also show that weak fragments of the Axiom of Choice, such as the Countable Choice, do not follow from \L o\'s's theorem, even assuming the existence of non-principal ultrafilters.</description>

      <title>Logic meets Wigner's Friend (and their Friends)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at Wigner's Friend thought-experiment and some of its more recent variants and extensions, such as the Frauchiger-Renner (FR) Paradox. We discuss various solutions proposed in the literature, focusing on a few questions: What is the correct epistemic interpretation of the multiplicity of state assignments in these scenarios? Under which conditions can one include classical observers into the quantum state descriptions, in a way that is still compatible with traditional Quantum Mechanics? Under which conditions can one system be admitted as an additional 'observer' from the perspective of another background observer? When can the standard axioms of multi-agent Epistemic Logic (that allow "knowledge transfer" between agents) be applied to quantum-physical observers? In the last part of the paper, we propose a new answer to these questions, sketch a particular formal implementation of this answer, and apply it to obtain a principled solution to Wigner Friend-type paradoxes.</description>
