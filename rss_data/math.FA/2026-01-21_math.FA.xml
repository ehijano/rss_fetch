      <title>Subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ Invariant Under Shifts by a Crystal Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a crystal group $\Gamma$ in dimension $n$, a closed subspace $\mathcal{V}$ of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is called $\Gamma$--shift invariant if, for every $f\in\mathcal{V}$, the shifts of $f$ by every element of $\Gamma$ also belong to $\mathcal{V}$. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a characterization of the $\Gamma$--shift invariant closed subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$.</description>

      <title>The nonlinear estimates on quantum Besov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superposition operators have been widely studied in nonlinear analysis, which are essential for the well-posedness theory of nonlinear equations. In this paper, we investigate the boundedness estimates of superposition operators with non-smooth symbols on quantum Besov spaces, which significantly generalize McDonald's results \cite{McNLE} for infinitely differentiable symbols and have rich applications in the well-posedness theory of noncommutative PDEs. As a byproduct, we prove the equivalence of the two descriptions of quantum Besov spaces, resolving the conjecture proposed in \cite[Remark 3.16]{McNLE}. The new ingredients in the proof also involve quantum chain rule and nonlinear interpolation.</description>

      <title>Invariant Means on $VN^n(G)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group, and $VN^n(G)$ is the dual of the multidimensional Fourier algebra $A^n(G)$. In this article, we define invariant means on $VN^n(G)$ and prove that the set of all invariant means on $VN^n(G)$ is non-empty. Further, we investigated the invariant means on $VN^n(G)$ for discrete and non-discrete cases of $G$. Also, we show that if $H$ is an open subgroup of $G$, then the number of invariant means on $VN^n(H)$ is the same as that of $VN^n(G)$. Finally, we study invariant means on the dual of the algebra $A_0^n(G)$, the closure of Fourier algebra $A^n(G)$ in the cb-multiplier norm.</description>

      <title>Majorization between symplectic spectra of positive semidefinite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite matrix $A$ with symplectic kernel, there exists a real $2n \times 2n$ \emph{symplectic matrix} $M$ such that $M^TAM= D \oplus D$, where $D$ is an $n \times n$ non-negative diagonal matrix which is unique up to permutation of its diagonal entries.
  The diagonal entries of $D$ are called the \emph{symplectic eigenvalues} or symplectic spectrum of $A$.
  In this work, we investigate some majorization and weak supermajorization relations between the symplectic spectra of two positive semidefinite matrices.
  More explicitly, suppose $A$ and $B$ are $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite matrices with symplectic kernels.
  We show that if the symplectic spectrum of $A$ is majorized by the symplectic spectrum of $B$, then $A$ lies in the convex hull of the symplectic orbit of $B$.
  We also establish that only a weak converse of this statement holds; i.e., if $A$ lies in the convex hull of the symplectic orbit of $B$ then the symplectic spectrum of $A$ is \emph{weakly supermajorized} by the symplectic spectrum of $B$.
  Several consequences of our results are also presented.
  Our methods make use of well-known connections between the theory of majorization, doubly stochastic, doubly superstochastic, and symplectic matrices.</description>

      <title>A Functorial Approach to Multi-Space Interpolation with Function Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of interpolation theory to more than two spaces by employing a functional parameter, while retaining a fully functorial and systematic framework. This approach allows for the construction of generalized intermediate spaces and ensures stability under natural operations such as powers and convex combinations. As a significant application, we demonstrate that the interpolation of multiple generalized Sobolev spaces yields a generalized Besov space. Our framework provides explicit tools for handling multi-parameter interpolation, highlighting both its theoretical robustness and practical relevance.</description>

      <title>Generalized Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces: A Functional Analytic Framework for Abstract Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a generalization of Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS), which we term \emph{Generalized Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces} (GRKBS). The motivation stems from recent results showing that classical fully connected neural networks can be understood as finite-dimensional subspaces of RKBS. Our generalization extends this perspective to settings with Banach-valued codomains, allowing the construction of \emph{abstract neural networks} (AbsNN) as compositions of GRKBS. This framework provides a natural pathway to model neural architectures that go beyond classical machine learning paradigms, including physically-informed structures governed by differential equations. We establish a unified definition of GRKBS, prove structural uniqueness results, and analyze the existence of sparse minimizers for the corresponding abstract training problem. This contributes to bridging functional analytic theory and the design of new neural architectures with applications in both approximation theory and mathematical modeling.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Packet Content for Positive Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple way to attach ``content" to the nodes of a wavelet packet tree when a positive operator is given. At a fixed packet depth, the packet projections split the operator into positive pieces, and this decomposition induces a boundary measure on the packet path space, together with vector-dependent densities that show how energy is distributed across the tree. We then study a sequential extraction procedure and two depth-fixed greedy rules for choosing packet blocks, one based on trace weights and one based on Hilbert-Schmidt weights. The main results are explicit geometric decay estimates for the remainder under these greedy removals. In the Hilbert-Schmidt case we also isolate a coherence quantity that measures how close the operator is to being block-diagonal in the packet partition. We close with a concrete patch-based denoising procedure for images, where packet blocks are selected by these content weights computed from an empirical second-moment operator; the construction ensures that both the approximants and the remainders stay positive at every step.</description>

      <title>Existence of Decreasing Nambu Solutions to the Rainbow Ladder Gap Equation of QCD by Cone Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying Nambu solutions of the rainbow-ladder gap equation in QCD at zero temperature and chemical potential, we prove that the mass function emerges continuously from zero as the interaction strength is increased past the critical point for all positive, asymptotically perturbative kernels almost everywhere continuous in $L^1$ using the Krasnosel'skii-Guo Cone Compression Theorem. We prove that the coupled system of equations must have a positive, continuous Nambu solution with decreasing mass function for all current quark masses for a class of models which includes the physical point of a popular model of QCD by using a hybrid Krasnosel'skii-Schauder Fixed Point Theorem.</description>

      <title>Weak quantum hypergroups from finite index C*-inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a finite index inclusion of simple unital C*-algebras and construct a canonical completely positive coproduct on the second relative commutant, thereby endowing it with a natural coalgebra structure. Motivated by this construction, we introduce the notion of a weak quantum hypergroup, a generalization of the quantum hypergroups of Chapovsky and Vainerman. We show that every finite index inclusion gives rise to such a weak quantum hypergroup, and that the corresponding weak quantum hypergroup possesses a Haar integral. In the irreducible case, this structure satisfies the axioms of a quantum hypergroup in the sense of Chapovsky and Vainerman, while in the depth 2 setting our framework yields the associated weak Hopf algebra constructed by Nikshych and Vainerman. These results provide a unified and intrinsically C*-algebraic framework for generalized quantum symmetries associated with finite index inclusions.</description>

      <title>PDE aspects of the dynamical optimal transport in the Lorentzian setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the crucial features of optimal transport on Riemannian manifolds is the equivalence of the `static', original, formulation of the problem and of the `dynamic' one, based on the study of the continuity equation. This furnishes the key link between Wasserstein geometry and PDEs that has found so many applications in the last 20 years.
  In this paper we investigate this kind of equivalence on spacetimes. At the PDE level, this requires to transition from the continuity equation to a suitable `continuity inequality', to which we shall refer to as `causal continuity inequality'. As a direct consequence of our findings we obtain a Lorentzian version of the celebrated Benamou--Brenier formula.</description>

      <title>Inverting the Fisher information operator in non-linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider non-linear regression models corrupted by generic noise when the regression functions form a non-linear subspace of L^2, relevant in non-linear PDE inverse problems and data assimilation. We show that when the score of the model is injective, the Fisher information operator is automatically invertible between well-identified Hilbert spaces, and we provide an operational characterization of these spaces. This allows us to construct in broad generality the efficient Gaussian involved in the classical minimax and convolution theorems to establish information lower bounds, that are typically achieved by Bayesian algorithms thus showing optimality of these methods. We illustrate our results on time-evolution PDE models for reaction-diffusion and Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Wasserstein regularization, defective local concentration and a cutoff criterion beyond non-negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Notions of positive curvature have been shown to imply many remarkable properties for Markov processes, in terms, e.g., of regularization effects, functional inequalities, mixing time bounds and, more recently, the cutoff phenomenon. In this work, we are interested in a relaxed variant of Ollivier's coarse Ricci curvature, where a Markov kernel $P$ satisfies only a weaker Wasserstein bound $W_p(\mu P, \nu P) \leq K W_p(\mu,\nu)+M$ for constants $M\ge 0, K\in [0,1], p \ge 1$. Under appropriate additional assumptions on the one-step transition measures $\delta_x P$, we establish (i) a form of local concentration, given by a defective Talagrand inequality, and (ii) an entropy-transport regularization effect. We consider as illustrative examples the Langevin dynamics and the Proximal Sampler when the target measure is a log-Lipschitz perturbation of a log-concave measure. As an application of the above results, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the cutoff phenomenon in some negatively curved settings.</description>

Abstract: We prove a noncommutative analogue of Minkowski's integral inequality for commuting squares of tracial von Neumann algebras. The inequality implies a necessary condition for a quadruple of graphs to be realized as inclusion graphs of a commuting square of multi-matrix algebras. As a corollary, we obtain a unitary categorification criterion for based rings, in particular, fusion rings.</description>

Abstract: We extend the results of (Liu and Firoozi, 2025), which develops the theory of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games in Hilbert spaces, by incorporating a common noise. This common noise is an infinite-dimensional Wiener process affecting the dynamics of all agents. In the presence of common noise, the mean-field consistency condition is characterized by a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic evolution equations (FBSEEs) in Hilbert spaces, whereas in its absence, it is represented by forward-backward deterministic evolution equations. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled linear FBSEEs associated with the LQ MFG setting for small time horizons and prove the $\epsilon$-Nash property of the resulting equilibrium strategy. Furthermore, for the first time in the literature, we develop an analysis that establishes the well-posedness of these coupled linear FBSEEs in Hilbert spaces, for which only mild solutions exist, over arbitrary finite time horizons.</description>

      <title>The norm of the Hilbert matrix operator on Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Karapetrovi\'c conjectured that the norm of the Hilbert matrix operator on the Bergman space $A^p_\alpha$ is equal to $\pi/\sin((2+\alpha)\pi/p)$ when $-1&lt;\alpha&lt;p-2$. In this paper, we provide a proof of this conjecture for $0\leq \alpha \leq \frac{6p^3-29p^2+17p-2+2p\sqrt{6p^2-11p+4}}{(3p-1)^2}$, and this range of $\alpha$ improves the best known result when $\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{47}$ and $\alpha \not=1$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Quantitative Forms of the Hardy Inequality on Cartan-Hadamard Manifolds via Sobolev-Lorentz Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the quantitative form of the classical Hardy inequality. In our first result, we prove the following quantitative bound under the assumption that the $\mathbb{M}^N$ is a Riemannian model satisfying the centered isoperimetric inequality: We prove that $$ \|\nabla_g u\|^2_{L^{2}(\mathbb{M}^N)} - \frac{(N-2)^2}{4}\left\|\frac{u}{r(x)}\right\|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{M}^N)} \geq C [\mbox{dist}(u, Z)]^{\frac{4N}{N-2}}\left\|\frac{u}{r(x)}\right\|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{M}^N)},$$ for every real-valued weakly differentiable function $u$ on $\mathbb{M}^N$ such that $|\nabla_g u| \in L^2(\mathbb{M}^N)$ and $u$ decays to zero at infinity. Here $r(x) = d_g(x,x_0)$ denotes the geodesic distance from a fixed pole $x_0,$ the set $Z$ represents the family of virtual extremals, and the distance is understood in an appropriate generalized Lorentz-type space. Our approach is built on the symmetrization technique on manifolds, combined with a novel Jacobian-type transformation that provides a precise way for comparing volume growth, level sets, and gradient terms across the two geometries of Euclidean and manifold settings. When coupled with symmetrization, this framework yields sharp control over the relevant functionals and reveals how the underlying curvature influences extremal behavior. Our result generalizes the seminal result of Cianchi-Ferone [Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e C Anal. Non Lin\'eaire 25 (2008)] to the curved spaces. Moreover, building upon this transformation, we succeed in extending Sobolev-Lorentz embedding-classically formulated in the Euclidean setting to the broader framework of Cartan-Hadamard models and we establish an optimal Sobolev-Lorentz embedding in this geometric setting. Finally, we establish a quantitative correspondence between the Hardy deficit on the manifold and an appropriate weighted Hardy deficit in Euclidean space, showing that each controls the other.</description>

      <title>On rough ideal convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of ideal convergence for sequences $(x_n)$ with values in a topological space $X$ with respect to a family $\{F_\eta:\eta\in X\}$ of subsets of $X$ with $\eta\in F_\eta$, where each $F_\eta$ measures the allowed ``roughness'' of convergence toward $\eta$.
  More precisely, after introducing the corresponding notions of cluster and limit points, we prove several inclusion and invariance properties, discuss their structural properties, and give examples showing that the rough notions are genuinely different from the classical ideal ones.</description>

      <title>Improving the local solution of the DG predictor of the ADER-DG method for solving systems of ordinary differential equations and its applicability to systems of differential-algebraic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved local numerical solution for the ADER-DG numerical method with a local DG predictor for solving the initial value problem for a first-order ODE system is proposed. The improved local numerical solution demonstrates convergence orders of one higher than the convergence order of the local numerical solution of the original ADER-DG numerical method and has the property of continuity at grid nodes. Rigorous proofs of the approximation orders of the local numerical solution and the improved local numerical solution are presented. Obtaining the proposed improved local numerical solution does not require significant changes to the structure of the ADER-DG numerical method. Therefore, all conclusions regarding the convergence orders of the numerical solution at grid nodes, the resulting superconvergence, and the high stability of the ADER-DG numerical method remain unchanged. A wide range of applications of the ADER-DG numerical method is presented for solving specific initial value problems for ODE systems for a wide range of polynomial degrees. The obtained results provide strong confirmation for the developed rigorous theory. The improved local numerical solution is shown to exhibit both higher accuracy and improved smoothness and point-wise comparability. Empirical convergence orders of all individual numerical solutions were calculated for a wide range of error norms, which well agree with the expected convergence orders. The rigorous proof, based on the $\epsilon$-embedding method, of the applicability of the ADER-DG numerical method with a local DG predictor to solving DAE systems is presents.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Conditioning of Multivariate Vandermonde Matrices in High-Degree Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multivariate monomial Vandermonde matrices $V_N(Z)$ with arbitrary distinct nodes $Z=\{z_1,\dots,z_s\}\subset B_2^n$ in the high-degree regime $N\ge s-1$. Introducing a projection-based geometric statistic -- the \emph{max-min projection separation} $\rho(Z,j)$ and its minimum $\kappa(Z)=\min_j\rho(Z,j)$ -- we construct Lagrange polynomials $Q_j\in\mathcal P_N^n$ with explicit coefficient bounds $$ \|Q_j\|_\infty \lesssim s\Bigl(\frac{4n}{\rho(Z,j)}\Bigr)^{s-1}. $$ These polynomials yield quantitative distance-to-span estimates for the rows of $V_N(Z)$ and, as consequences, $$ \sigma_{\min}(V_N(Z)) \gtrsim \frac{\kappa(Z)^{s-1}}{(4n)^{s-1} s\sqrt{s \nu(n,N)}}, \quad \nu(n,N)={N+n\choose N}, $$ and an explicit right inverse $V_N(Z)^+$ with operator-norm control $$ \|V_N(Z)^+\| \lesssim s^{3/2}\sqrt{\nu(n,N)}\Bigl(\frac{4n}{\kappa(Z)}\Bigr)^{s-1}. $$ Our estimates are dimension-explicit and expressed directly in terms of the local geometry parameter $\kappa(Z)$; they apply to \emph{every} distinct node set $Z\subset B_2^n$ without any \emph{a priori} separation assumptions. In particular, $V_N(Z)$ has full row rank whenever $N\ge s-1$. The results complement the Fourier-type theory (on the complex unit circle/torus), where lower bounds for $\sigma_{\min}$ hinge on uniform separation or cluster structure; here stability is quantified instead via high polynomial degree and the projection geometry of $Z$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop some tools, of an algebraic and combinatorial nature, which enable us to obtain a detailed description of certain quadratic subgroups of the (outer) reduced Weyl group of the Cuntz algebra ${\mathcal O}_n$. In particular, for $n=4$ our findings give a self-contained theoretical interpretation of the groups tabulated in [AJS18], which were obtained with the help of a computer. For each of these groups we provide a set of generators. A prominent role in our analysis is played by a certain family of subgroups of the symmetric group of a discrete square which we call bicompatible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Input-Connected Multilayer Perceptron (IC-MLP), a feedforward neural network architecture in which each hidden neuron receives, in addition to the outputs of the preceding layer, a direct affine connection from the raw input. We first study this architecture in the univariate setting and give an explicit and systematic description of IC-MLPs with an arbitrary finite number of hidden layers, including iterated formulas for the network functions. In this setting, we prove a universal approximation theorem showing that deep IC-MLPs can approximate any continuous function on a closed interval of the real line if and only if the activation function is nonlinear. We then extend the analysis to vector-valued inputs and establish a corresponding universal approximation theorem for continuous functions on compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.10937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fock space can be characterized (up to a positive multiplicative factor) as the only Hilbert space of entire functions in which the adjoint of derivation is multiplication by the complex variable. Similarly (and still up to a positive multiplicative factor) the Hardy space is the only space of functions analytic in the open unit disk for which the adjoint of the backward shift operator is the multiplication operator. In the present paper we characterize the Hardy space and some related reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in terms of the adjoint of the differentiation operator. We use reproducing kernel methods, which seem to also give a new characterization of the Fock space.</description>

Abstract: In this thesis we consider crystal groups in dimension $n$ and their natural unitary representation on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$. We show that this representation is unitarily equivalent to a direct integral of factor representations, and use this to characterize the subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ invariant under crystal symmetry shifts. Finally, by giving an explicit unitary equivalence of the natural crystal group representation, we find the \textit{central decomposition} guaranteed by direct integral theory.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a p-adic Hilbert space. Let $A:\mathcal{D}(A)\subseteq \mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$ and $B: \mathcal{D}(B)\subseteq \mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$ be possibly unbounded self-adjoint linear operators. For $x \in \mathcal{D}(A)$ with $\langle x, x \rangle =1$, define $ \Delta_x(A):= \|Ax- \langle Ax, x \rangle x \|.$ Then for all $x \in \mathcal{D}(AB)\cap \mathcal{D}(BA)$ with $\langle x, x \rangle =1$, we show that \begin{align*} (1) \quad \quad \quad \max\{\Delta_x(A), \Delta_x(B)\}\geq \frac{\sqrt{\bigg|\big\langle [A,B]x, x \big\rangle ^2+\big(\langle \{A,B\}x, x \rangle -2\langle Ax, x \rangle\langle Bx, x \rangle\big)^2\bigg|}}{\sqrt{|2|}} \end{align*} and \begin{align*} (2) \quad \quad \quad \max\{\Delta_x(A), \Delta_x(B)\} \geq |\langle (A+B)x, y \rangle |, \quad \forall y \in \mathcal{X} \text{ satisfying } \|y\|\leq 1, \langle x, y \rangle =0. \end{align*} We call Inequality (1) as p-adic Heisenberg-Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty principle and Inequality (2) as p-adic Maccone-Pati uncertainty principle.</description>

Abstract: We characterize all $f$-algebra products on AM-spaces by constructing a canonical AM-space $W_X$ associated to each AM-space $X$, such that the $f$-algebra products on $X$ correspond bijectively to the positive cone $(W_X)_+$. This generalizes the classical description of $f$-algebra products on $C(K)$ spaces. We also identify the unique product (when it exists) that embeds $X$ as a closed subalgebra of $C(K)$, and study AM-spaces for which this product exists -- the so-called AM-algebras. Finally, we investigate AM-spaces that admit only the zero product, providing a characterization in the AL-space case and examples showing that no simple characterization exists in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the norms for symmetric and antisymmetric tensor products of weighted shift operators. By proving that for $n\geq 2$,
  $$\|S_{\alpha}^{l_1}\odot\cdots \odot S_{\alpha}^{l_k}\odot S_{\alpha}^{*l_{k+1}}\odot\cdots \odot S_{\alpha}^{*l_{n}}\| =\mathop{\prod}_{i=1}^n\left \| S_{\alpha}^{{l_{i}}}\right\|, \text{ for any} \ (l_1,l_2\cdots l_n)\in\mathbb N^n$$ if and only if the weight satisfies the regularity condition, we partially solve \cite[Problem 6 and Problem 7]{GA}. It will be seen that most weighted shift operators on function spaces, including weighted Bergman shift, Hardy shift, Dirichlet shift, etc, satisfy the regularity condition. Moreover, at the end of the paper, we solve \cite[Problem 1 and Problem 2]{GA}.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)\setminus\{1\}$, $p&gt;0$ and positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, we consider the quasi-extension $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=\mathcal{M}_\alpha(A^p,B^p)^{1/p}$ of several $\alpha$-weighted geometric type matrix means $\mathcal{M}_\alpha(A,B)$ such as the $\alpha$-weighted geometric mean in Kubo--Ando's sense, the R\'enyi mean, etc. The log-majorization $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\prec_{\log}\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ is examined for pairs $(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N})$ of those $\alpha$-weighted geometric type means. The joint concavity/convexity of the trace functions $\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}$ is also discussed based on theory of quantum divergences.</description>

      <title>Folded optimal transport and its application to separable quantum optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce folded optimal transport, as a method to extend a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole convex, related to convex extension. This construction broadens the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case of the convex being a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the folded Kantorovich cost and folded Wasserstein distances, and study their induced metric properties. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-Franca [4], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. We also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [16] cost writes as a folded Kantorovich cost. Folded optimal transport therefore provides a unified framework for classical, semiclassical and separable quantum optimal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known characterization of Jordan vectors of a matrix polynomial $L(z)$ is generalized to a characterization of Jordan vectors of the operator-valued function $Q(z)$ at an eigenvalue $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. The results are then applied to solve a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations.</description>

      <title>Frame eversion and contextual geometric rigidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove rigidity results describing contextually-constrained maps defined on Grassmannians and manifolds of ordered independent line tuples in finite-dimensional vector or Hilbert spaces. One statement in the spirit of the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry classifies maps between full Grassmannians of two $n$-dimensional Hilbert spaces, $n\ge 3$, preserving dimension and lattice operations for pairs with commuting orthogonal projections, as precisely those induced by semilinear injections unique up to scaling.
  In a different but related direction, denote the manifolds of ordered orthogonal (linearly-independent) $n$-tuples of lines in an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $V$ by $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(V)$ (respectively $\mathbb{F}(V)$) and, for partitions $\pi$ of the set $\{1..n\}$, call two tuples $\pi$-linked if the spans along $\pi$-blocks agree. A Wigner-style rigidity theorem proves that the symmetric maps $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(\mathbb{C}^n)\to \mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, $n\ge 3$ respecting $\pi$-linkage are precisely those induced by semilinear injections, hence by linear or conjugate-linear maps if also assumed measurable. On the other hand, in the $\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$-defined analogue the only other possibility is a qualitatively new type of purely-contextual-global symmetry transforming a tuple $(\ell_i)_i$ of lines into $\left(\left(\bigoplus_{j\ne i}\ell_j\right)^{\perp}\right)_i$.</description>

      <title>On some Sobolev and P\'olya-Szeg\"o type inequalities with weights and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are motivated by studying a boundary-value problem for a class of semilinear degenerate elliptic equations
  \begin{align}\tag{P}\label{P}
  \begin{cases}
  - \Delta_x u - |x|^{2\alpha} \dfrac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = f(x,y,u), &amp; \textrm{in } \Omega,
  u = 0, &amp; \textrm{on } \partial \Omega,
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}
  where $x = (x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$, $(0,0,0) \in \Omega $, and $\alpha &gt; 0$.
  In this paper, we will study this problem by establishing embedding theorems for weighted Sobolev spaces. To this end, we need a new P\'olya-Szeg\"o type inequality, which can be obtained by studying an isoperimetric problem for the corresponding weighted area. Our results then extend the existing ones in \cite{nga, Luyen2} to the three-dimensional context.</description>

Abstract: In 1996, Meshulam proved that every sequence generated by applying projections onto affine subspaces, drawn from a finite collection in Euclidean space, must be bounded.
  In this paper, we extend his result not only from affine subspaces to convex polyhedral subsets, but also from Euclidean to general Hilbert space. Various examples are provided to illustrate the sharpness of the results.</description>

      <title>Locally similar distances and equality of the induced intrinsic distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a set and $d_1,d_2$ be two distances on $X$. We say that $d_1$ and $d_2$ are locally similar and write $d_1\cong d_2$ if $d_1$ and $d_2$ are topologically equivalent and, for every $a$ in $X$, \[ \lim_{x\to a} \frac{d_2(x,a)}{d_1(x,a)}=1. \] We prove that if $d_1\cong d_2$, then the intrinsic distances induced by $d_1$ and $d_2$ coincide. We also provide sufficient conditions for $d_1\cong d_2$ and consider several examples related to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates of self-repelling diffusions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of self-repelling diffusions on compact Riemannian manifolds whose drift is the gradient of a potential accumulated along their trajectory. When the interaction potential admits a suitable spectral decomposition, the dynamics and its environment are equivalent to a finite-dimensional degenerate diffusion. We show that this diffusion is a second-order lift of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose invariant law corresponds to the Gaussian invariant measure of the environment, and immediately obtain a general upper bound on the rate of convergence to stationarity using the framework of second-order lifts. Furthermore, using a flow Poincar\'e inequality, we develop lower bounds on the convergence rate. We show that, in the periodic case, these lower bounds improve upon those of Bena\"im and Gauthier (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 2016), and even match the order of the upper bound in some cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantitative stability associated with the adjoint Fourier restriction inequality, focusing on the paraboloid and two-dimensional sphere cases. We show that these Strichartz-stability inequalities admit minimizers attaining their sharp constants, provided that these sharp constants are strictly smaller than the corresponding spectral-gap constants. Furthermore, for the two-dimensional sphere case, we obtain the existence of minimizers.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Stability of Entropy Minimizers under Block-Separable Convex Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate entropy minimization problems for quantum states subject to convex block-separable constraints. Our principal result is a quantitative stability theorem: under a natural confining (fixed-support) hypothesis, if a state has entropy within {\epsilon} of the minimum permitted by the constraint, then it must lie within O({\epsilon}^{1/2}) in trace norm of the set of entropy minimizers. We show that this rate is optimal and cannot be improved uniformly.
  The analysis is entirely finite-dimensional and exploits the block-separable structure of the constraint set, which induces a natural decomposition of entropy into a marginal (classical) component and conditional (internal) components. Quadratic stability emerges from the curvature of Shannon entropy on the marginal polytope and of von Neumann entropy on the constrained block states, yielding explicit stability constants determined by the geometry of the constraint.
  We further demonstrate that this stability phenomenon cannot be derived from Pinsker-type inequalities or standard entropy continuity bounds, since no reference state is fixed a priori and the entropy minimizer arises intrinsically from the constraint geometry. The framework is abstract and independent of any arithmetic input, and provides a general quadratic stability principle for entropy minimization under structured convex constraints.</description>

      <title>Horizon Activation Mapping for Neural Networks in Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks for time series forecasting have relied on error metrics and architecture-specific interpretability approaches for model selection that don't apply across models of different families. To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, architectural choices, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other. Multivariate forecasting models including MLP-based CycleNet, N-Linear, N-HITS, self attention-based FEDformer, Pyraformer, SSM-based SpaceTime and diffusion-based Multi-Resolution DDPM over different horizon sizes trained over the ETTm2 dataset are used for HAM plots in this study. NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families.</description>

      <title>Spectral Fusion Deformations for Locally Compact Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a deformation framework for $C^*$-algebras equipped with a coaction of a locally compact quantum group, formulated intrinsically at the level of spectral subspaces determined by the coaction. The construction is defined algebraically on a finite spectral core and extended by continuity to a natural Fr\'echet $*$-algebra completion under mild analytic regularity assumptions.
  Deformations are governed by scalar fusion data assigning phases to fusion channels of irreducible corepresentations. Associativity and $*$-compatibility are characterized by explicit algebraic identities. The framework recovers a range of known deformation procedures, including Rieffel, Kasprzak, and Drinfeld-type constructions, and also yields genuinely new deformations that do not arise from dual $2$--cocycles or crossed-product methods.
  At the $C^*$-level, we identify a minimal reduced setting in which the deformed algebra admits a canonical completion, formulated in terms of boundedness of the deformed left regular action on the Haar--GNS space. This separates algebraic coherence from analytic implementability and clarifies the precise role of higher-order fusion data in deformation theory for locally compact quantum groups. In particular, the framework exhibits explicit associator-level deformations governed by fusion $3$--cocycles that cannot arise from any dual $2$--cocycle or crossed-product construction.</description>
