      <title>Auto-Stabilized Weak Galerkin Finite Element Methods for Biharmonic Equations on Polytopal Meshes without Convexity Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an auto-stabilized weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for biharmonic equations with built-in stabilizers. Unlike existing stabilizer-free WG methods limited to convex elements in finite element partitions, our approach accommodates both convex and non-convex polytopal meshes, offering enhanced versatility. It employs bubble functions without the restrictive conditions required by existing stabilizer-free WG methods, thereby simplifying implementation and broadening application to various partial differential equations (PDEs). Additionally, our method supports flexible polynomial degrees in discretization and is applicable in any dimension, unlike existing stabilizer-free WG methods that are confined to specific polynomial degree combinations and 2D or 3D settings. We demonstrate optimal order error estimates for WG approximations in both a discrete $H^2$ norm for $k\geq 2$ and a $L^2$ norm for $k&gt;2$, as well as a sub-optimal error estimate in $L^2$ when $k=2$, where $k\geq 2$ denotes the degree of polynomials in the approximation.</description>

      <title>A Canonical Gauge for Computing of Eigenpairs of the Magnetic Schr\"odinger Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalue problem for the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator and take advantage of a property called gauge invariance to transform the given problem into an equivalent problem that is more amenable to numerical approximation. More specifically, we propose a canonical magnetic gauge that can be computed by solving a Poisson problem, that yields a new operator having the same spectrum but eigenvectors that are less oscillatory. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate that accurate computation of eigenpairs can be done more efficiently and stably with the canonical magnetic gauge.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of some Magnus-type schemes for the finite element discretization of non-autonomous parabolic SPDEs driven by additive fractional Brownian motion and Poisson random measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to provide the strong convergence results of numerical approximations of a general second order non-autonomous semilinear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven simultaneously by an additive fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurst parameter H \in (1/2,1) and a Poisson random measure, more realistic in modelling real world phenomena.
  Approximations in space are performed by the standard finite element method and in time by the stochastic Magnus-type integrator or the linear semi-implicit Euler method. We investigate the mean-square errors estimates of our fully discrete schemes and the results show how the convergence orders depend on the regularity of the initial data and the driven processes. To the best of our knowledge, these two schemes are the first numerical methods to approximate the non-autonomous semilinear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven simultaneously by an additive fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H and a Poisson random measure.</description>

      <title>A construction of canonical nonconforming finite element spaces for elliptic equations of any order in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified construction of canonical $H^m$-nonconforming finite elements is developed for $n$-dimensional simplices for any $m, n \geq 1$. Consistency with the Morley-Wang-Xu elements [Math. Comp. 82 (2013), pp. 25-43] is maintained when $m \leq n$. In the general case, the degrees of freedom and the shape function space exhibit well-matched multi-layer structures that ensure their alignment. Building on the concept of the nonconforming bubble function, the unisolvence is established using an equivalent integral-type representation of the shape function space and by applying induction on $m$. The corresponding nonconforming finite element method applies to $2m$-th order elliptic problems, with numerical results for $m=3$ and $m=4$ in 2D supporting the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>A Second Moment Method for k-Eigenvalue Acceleration with Continuous Diffusion and Discontinuous Transport Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second moment method is a linear acceleration technique which couples the transport equation to a diffusion equation with transport-dependent additive closures. The resulting low-order diffusion equation can be discretized independent of the transport discretization, unlike diffusion synthetic acceleration, and is symmetric positive definite, unlike quasi-diffusion. While this method has been shown to be comparable to quasi-diffusion in iterative performance for fixed source and time-dependent problems, it is largely unexplored as an eigenvalue problem acceleration scheme due to thought that the resulting inhomogeneous source makes the problem ill-posed. Recently, a preliminary feasibility study was performed on the second moment method for eigenvalue problems. The results suggested comparable performance to quasi-diffusion and more robust performance than diffusion synthetic acceleration. This work extends the initial study to more realistic reactor problems using state-of-the-art discretization techniques. Results in this paper show that the second moment method is more computationally efficient than its alternatives on complex reactor problems with unstructured meshes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Matrix Decomposition for High-Dimensional Structured Systems: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel matrix decomposition method, referred to as the \( D \)-decomposition, designed to improve computational efficiency and stability for solving high-dimensional linear systems. The decomposition factorizes a matrix \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \) into three matrices \( A = PDQ \), where \( P \), \( D \), and \( Q \) are structured to exploit sparsity, low rank, and other matrix properties. We provide rigorous proofs for the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the decomposition under various conditions, including noise perturbations and rank constraints. The \( D \)-decomposition offers significant computational advantages, particularly for sparse or low-rank matrices, reducing the complexity from \( O(n^3) \) for traditional decompositions to \( O(n^2 k) \) or better, depending on the structure of the matrix. This method is particularly suited for large-scale applications in machine learning, signal processing, and data science. Numerical examples demonstrate the method's superior performance over traditional LU and QR decompositions, particularly in the context of dimensionality reduction and large-scale matrix factorization.</description>

      <title>Randomized low-rank Runge-Kutta methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes and analyzes a new class of numerical integrators for computing low-rank approximations to solutions of matrix differential equation. We combine an explicit Runge-Kutta method with repeated randomized low-rank approximation to keep the rank of the stages limited. The so-called generalized Nystr\"om method is particularly well suited for this purpose; it builds low-rank approximations from random sketches of the discretized dynamics. In contrast, all existing dynamical low-rank approximation methods are deterministic and usually perform tangent space projections to limit rank growth. Using such tangential projections can result in larger error compared to approximating the dynamics directly. Moreover, sketching allows for increased flexibility and efficiency by choosing structured random matrices adapted to the structure of the matrix differential equation. Under suitable assumptions, we establish moment and tail bounds on the error of our randomized low-rank Runge-Kutta methods. When combining the classical Runge-Kutta method with generalized Nystr\"om, we obtain a method called Rand RK4, which exhibits fourth-order convergence numerically -- up to the low-rank approximation error. For a modified variant of Rand RK4, we also establish fourth-order convergence theoretically. Numerical experiments for a range of examples from the literature demonstrate that randomized low-rank Runge-Kutta methods compare favorably with two popular dynamical low-rank approximation methods, in terms of robustness and speed of convergence.</description>

      <title>Block structured matrix-sequences and their spectral and singular value canonical distributions: a general theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years more and more involved block structures appeared in the literature in the context of numerical approximations of complex infinite dimensional operators modeling real-world applications. In various settings, thanks the theory of generalized locally Toeplitz matrix-sequences, the asymptotic distributional analysis is well understood, but a general theory is missing when general block structures are involved. The central part of the current work deals with such a delicate generalization when blocks are of (block) unilevel Toeplitz type, starting from a problem of recovery with missing data. Visualizations, numerical tests, and few open problems are presented and critically discussed.</description>

      <title>Two-level Restricted Additive Schwarz preconditioner based on Multiscale Spectral Generalized FEM for Heterogeneous Helmholtz Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze a two-level restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner for heterogeneous Helmholtz problems, based on a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) proposed in [C. Ma, C. Alber, and R. Scheichl, SIAM. J. Numer. Anal., 61 (2023), pp. 1546--1584]. The preconditioner uses local solves with impedance boundary conditions, and a global coarse solve based on the MS-GFEM approximation space constructed from local eigenproblems. It is derived by first formulating MS-GFEM as a Richardson iterative method, and without using an oversampling technique, reduces to the preconditioner recently proposed and analyzed in [Q. Hu and Z.Li, arXiv 2402.06905].
  We prove that both the Richardson iterative method and the preconditioner used within GMRES converge at a rate of $\Lambda$ under some reasonable conditions, where $\Lambda$ denotes the error of the underlying MS-GFEM \rs{approximation}. Notably, the convergence proof of GMRES does not rely on the `Elman theory'. An exponential convergence property of MS-GFEM, resulting from oversampling, ensures that only a few iterations are needed for convergence with a small coarse space. Moreover, the convergence rate $\Lambda$ is not only independent of the fine-mesh size $h$ and the number of subdomains, but decays with increasing wavenumber $k$. In particular, in the constant-coefficient case, with $h\sim k^{-1-\gamma}$ for some $\gamma\in (0,1]$, it holds that $\Lambda \sim k^{-1+\frac{\gamma}{2}}$.</description>

      <title>A robust fourth-order finite-difference discretization for the strongly anisotropic transport equation in magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a second-order temporally implicit, fourth-order-accurate spatial discretization scheme for the strongly anisotropic heat transport equation characteristic of hot, fusion-grade plasmas. Following [Du Toit et al., Comp. Phys. Comm., 228 (2018)], the scheme transforms mixed-derivative diffusion fluxes (which are responsible for the lack of a discrete maximum principle) into nonlinear advective fluxes, amenable to nonlinear-solver-friendly monotonicity-preserving limiters. The scheme enables accurate multi-dimensional heat transport simulations with up to seven orders of magnitude of heat-transport-coefficient anisotropies with low cross-field numerical error pollution and excellent algorithmic performance, with the number of linear iterations scaling very weakly with grid resolution and grid anisotropy, and scaling with the square-root of the implicit timestep. We propose a multigrid preconditioning strategy based on a second-order-accurate approximation that renders the scheme efficient and scalable under grid refinement. Several numerical tests are presented that display the expected spatial convergence rates and strong algorithmic performance, including fully nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics simulations of kink instabilities in a Bennett pinch in 2D helical geometry and of ITER in 3D toroidal geometry.</description>

      <title>Differentiable programming across the PDE and Machine Learning barrier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning and physical laws has shown immense potential for solving scientific problems driven by partial differential equations (PDEs) with the promise of fast inference, zero-shot generalisation, and the ability to discover new physics. Examples include the use of fundamental physical laws as inductive bias to machine learning algorithms, also referred to as physics-driven machine learning, and the application of machine learning to represent features not represented in the differential equations such as closures for unresolved spatiotemporal scales. However, the simulation of complex physical systems by coupling advanced numerics for PDEs with state-of-the-art machine learning demands the composition of specialist PDE solving frameworks with industry-standard machine learning tools. Hand-rolling either the PDE solver or the neural net will not cut it. In this work, we introduce a generic differentiable programming abstraction that provides scientists and engineers with a highly productive way of specifying end-to-end differentiable models coupling machine learning and PDE-based components, while relying on code generation for high performance. Our interface automates the coupling of arbitrary PDE-based systems and machine learning models and unlocks new applications that could not hitherto be tackled, while only requiring trivial changes to existing code. Our framework has been adopted in the Firedrake finite-element library and supports the PyTorch and JAX ecosystems, as well as downstream libraries.</description>

      <title>A Policy Iteration Method for Inverse Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We further prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian Vortex Method on Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an Eulerian vortex method based on the theory of flow maps to simulate the complex vortical motions of incompressible fluids. Central to our method is the novel incorporation of the flow-map transport equations for line elements, which, in combination with a bi-directional marching scheme for flow maps, enables the high-fidelity Eulerian advection of vorticity variables. The fundamental motivation is that, compared to impulse $\mathbf{m}$, which has been recently bridged with flow maps to encouraging results, vorticity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ promises to be preferable for its numerically stability and physical interpretability. To realize the full potential of this novel formulation, we develop a new Poisson solving scheme for vorticity-to-velocity reconstruction that is both efficient and able to accurately handle the coupling near solid boundaries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with a range of vortex simulation examples, including leapfrog vortices, vortex collisions, cavity flow, and the formation of complex vortical structures due to solid-fluid interactions.</description>

      <title>KANtrol: A Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for Solving Multi-Dimensional and Fractional Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the KANtrol framework, which utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to solve optimal control problems involving continuous time variables. We explain how Gaussian quadrature can be employed to approximate the integral parts within the problem, particularly for integro-differential state equations. We also demonstrate how automatic differentiation is utilized to compute exact derivatives for integer-order dynamics, while for fractional derivatives of non-integer order, we employ matrix-vector product discretization within the KAN framework. We tackle multi-dimensional problems, including the optimal control of a 2D heat partial differential equation. The results of our simulations, which cover both forward and parameter identification problems, show that the KANtrol framework outperforms classical MLPs in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Tropical Laurent series, their tropical roots, and localization results for the eigenvalues of nonlinear matrix functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.07982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tropical roots of tropical polynomials have been previously studied and used to localize roots of classical polynomials and eigenvalues of matrix polynomials. We extend the theory of tropical roots from tropical polynomials to tropical Laurent series. Our proposed definition ensures that, as in the polynomial case, there is a bijection between tropical roots and slopes of the Newton polygon associated with the tropical Laurent series. We show that, unlike in the polynomial case, there may be infinitely many tropical roots; moreover, there can be at most two tropical roots of infinite multiplicity. We then apply the new theory by relating the inner and outer radii of convergence of a classical Laurent series to the behavior of the sequence of tropical roots of its tropicalization. Finally, as a second application, we discuss localization results both for roots of scalar functions that admit a local Laurent series expansion and for nonlinear eigenvalues of regular matrix valued functions that admit a local Laurent series expansion.</description>

      <title>A reduced-order model for advection-dominated problems based on Radon-Cumulative-Distribution Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problems with dominant advection, discontinuities, travelling features, or shape variations are widespread in computational mechanics. However, classical linear model reduction and interpolation methods typically fail to reproduce even relatively small parameter variations, making the reduced models inefficient and inaccurate. This work proposes a model order reduction approach based on the Radon-Cumulative-Distribution transform (RCDT). We demonstrate numerically that this non-linear transformation can overcome some limitations of standard proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reconstructions and is capable of interpolating accurately some advection-dominated phenomena, although it may introduce artefacts due to the discrete forward and inverse transform. The method is tested on various test cases coming from both manufactured examples and fluid dynamics problems.</description>

      <title>On the Identifiablility of Nonlocal Interaction Kernels in First-Order Systems of Interacting Particles on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a critical issue in nonparametric inference for systems of interacting particles on Riemannian manifolds: the identifiability of the interaction functions. Specifically, we define the function spaces on which the interaction kernels can be identified given infinite i.i.d observational derivative data sampled from a distribution. Our methodology involves casting the learning problem as a linear statistical inverse problem using a operator theoretical framework. We prove the well-posedness of inverse problem by establishing the strict positivity of a related integral operator and our analysis allows us to refine the results on specific manifolds such as the sphere and Hyperbolic space. Our findings indicate that a numerically stable procedure exists to recover the interaction kernel from finite (noisy) data, and the estimator will be convergent to the ground truth. This also answers an open question in [MMQZ21] and demonstrate that least square estimators can be statistically optimal in certain scenarios. Finally, our theoretical analysis could be extended to the mean-field case, revealing that the corresponding nonparametric inverse problem is ill-posed in general and necessitates effective regularization techniques.</description>

      <title>Numerical stability of the symplectic $LL^T$ factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give the detailed error analysis of two algorithms $W_1$ and $W_2$ for computing the symplectic factorization of a symmetric positive definite and symplectic matrix $A \in \mathbb R^{2n \times 2n}$ in the form $A=LL^T$,
  where $L \in \mathbb R^{2n \times 2n}$ is a symplectic block lower triangular matrix. We prove that Algorithm $W_2$ is numerically stable for a broader class of symmetric positive definite matrices $A \in \mathbb R^{2n \times 2n}$. It means that Algorithm $W_2$ is producing the computed factors $\tilde L$ in floating-point arithmetic with machine precision $\mathcal{u}$ such that $||A-\tilde L {\tilde L}^T||_{2} = {\cal O}(\mathcal{u} ||{A}||_{2})$. On the other hand, Algorithm $W_1$ is unstable, in general, for symmetric positive definite and symplectic matrix $A$. In this paper we also give corresponding bounds for Algorithm $W_1$ that are weaker. We show that the factorization error depends on the condition number $\kappa_2(A_{11})$ of the principal submatrix $A_{11}$.
  Bounds for the loss of symplecticity of the lower block triangular matrices $L$ for both Algorithms $W_1$ and $W_2$ that hold in exact arithmetic for a broader class of symmetric positive definite matrices $A$ (but not necessarily symplectic) are also given. The tests performed in \textsl{MATLAB} illustrate that our error bounds for considered algorithms are reasonably sharp.</description>

      <title>A low-rank solver for conforming multipatch Isogeometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an innovative isogeometric low-rank solver for the linear elasticity model problem, specifically designed to allow multipatch domains. Our approach splits the domain into subdomains, each formed by the union of neighboring patches. Within each subdomain, we employ Tucker low-rank matrices and vectors to approximate the system matrices and right-hand side vectors, respectively. This enables the construction of local approximate fast solvers. These local solvers are then combined into an overlapping Schwarz preconditioner, which is utilized in a truncated preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant memory storage benefits and a uniformly bounded number of iterations with respect to both mesh size and spline degree.</description>

      <title>Discretization of Total Variation in Optimization with Integrality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce discretizations of infinite-dimensional optimization problems with total variation regularization and integrality constraints on the optimization variables. We advance the discretization of the dual formulation of the total variation term with Raviart--Thomas functions which is known from literature for certain convex problems. Since we have an integrality constraint, the previous analysis from Caillaud and Chambolle [10] does not hold anymore. Even weaker $\Gamma$-convergence results do not hold anymore because the recovery sequences generally need to attain non-integer values to recover the total variation of the limit function. We solve this issue by introducing a discretization of the input functions on an embedded, finer mesh. A superlinear coupling of the mesh sizes implies an averaging on the coarser mesh of the Raviart--Thomas ansatz, which enables to recover the total variation of integer-valued limit functions with integer-valued discretized input functions. Moreover, we are able to estimate the discretized total variation of the recovery sequence by the total variation of its limit and an error depending on the mesh size ratio. For the discretized optimization problems, we additionally add a constraint that vanishes in the limit and enforces compactness of the sequence of minimizers, which yields their convergence to a minimizer of the original problem. This constraint contains a degree of freedom whose admissible range is determined. Its choice may have a strong impact on the solutions in practice as we demonstrate with an example from imaging.</description>

      <title>Fourth-order entropy-stable lattice Boltzmann schemes for hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for the development of fourth-order lattice Boltzmann schemes to tackle multidimensional nonlinear systems of conservation laws.  As for other numerical schemes for hyperbolic problems, high-order accuracy applies only to smooth solutions. Our numerical schemes preserve two fundamental characteristics inherent in classical lattice Boltzmann methods: a local relaxation phase and a transport phase composed of elementary shifts on a Cartesian grid. Achieving fourth-order accuracy is accomplished through the composition of second-order time-symmetric basic schemes utilizing rational weights. This enables the representation of the transport phase in terms of elementary shifts. Introducing local variations in the relaxation parameter during each stage of relaxation ensures entropy stability of the schemes. This not only enhances stability in the long-time limit but also maintains fourth-order accuracy. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive testing on scalar equations and systems in both one and two spatial dimensions.</description>

Abstract: With the development of multi-layer elastic systems in the field of engineering mechanics, the corresponding variational inequality theory and algorithm design have received more attention and research. In this study, a class of equivalent saddle point problems with interlayer Tresca friction conditions and the mixed finite element method are proposed and analyzed. Then, the convergence of the numerical solution of the mixed finite element method is theoretically proven, and the corresponding algebraic dual algorithm is given. Finally, through numerical experiments, the mixed finite element method is not only compared with the layer decomposition method, but also its convergence relationship with respect to the spatial discretization parameter $H$ is verified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the numerical approximation of a class of ergodic Backward Stochastic Differential Equations. These equations are formulated in an infinite horizon framework and provide a probabilistic representation for elliptic Partial Differential Equations of ergodic type. In order to build our numerical scheme, we put forward a new representation of the PDE solution by using a classical probabilistic representation of the gradient. Then, based on this representation, we propose a fully implementable numerical scheme using a Picard iteration procedure, a grid space discretization and a Monte-Carlo approximation. Up to a limiting technical condition that guarantees the contraction of the Picard procedure, we obtain an upper bound for the numerical error. We also provide some numerical experiments that show the efficiency of this approach for small dimensions.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advection-dominated problems are commonly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and a wide range of industrial processes. For these problems, linear approximation methods (proper orthogonal decomposition and reduced basis method) are not suitable, as the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay is slow, leading to inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models. There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural-network shift augmented transformation technique, that employs automatic-shit detection and detects the optimal non-linear transformation of the full-order model solution manifold $\mathcal{M}$. We exploit a deep-learning framework to derive parameter-dependent bijective mapping between the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. It consists of two neural networks, 1) ShiftNet, to employ automatic-shift detection by learning the shift-operator, which finds the optimal shifts for numerous snapshots of the full-order solution manifold, to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay, and 2) InterpNet, which learns the reference configuration and can reconstruct the field values of the same, for each shifted grid distribution. We construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear subspaces and employ automatic-shift detection for predictions. We test our methodology on advection-dominated problems, such as 1D travelling waves, 2D isentropic convective vortex and 2D two-phase flow test cases. This work leads to the development of the complete NNsPOD-ROM algorithm for model reduction of advection-dominated problems, comprising both offline-online stages.</description>

      <title>On nonlinear magnetic field solvers using local Quasi-Newton updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed-point or Newton-methods are typically employed for the numerical solution of nonlinear systems arising from discretization of nonlinear magnetic field problems. We here discuss an alternative strategy which uses local Quasi-Newton updates to construct appropriate linearizations of the material behavior during the nonlinear iteration. The resulting scheme shows similar fast convergence as the Newton-method but, like the fixed-point methods, does not require derivative information of the underlying material law. As a consequence, the method can be used for the efficient solution of models with hysteresis which involve nonsmooth material behavior. The implementation of the proposed scheme can be realized in standard finite-element codes in parallel to the fixed-point and the Newton method. A full convergence analysis of all three methods is established proving global mesh-independent convergence. The theoretical results and the performance of the nonlinear iterative schemes are evaluated by computational tests for a typical benchmark problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work extends our previous study from S. Shrestha et al. (2024) by introducing a new abstract framework for Variational Multiscale (VMS) methods at the discrete level. We introduce the concept of what we define as the optimal projector and present an approach where the infinite-dimensional unresolved scales are approximated in a finite-dimensional subspace using the numerically computed Fine-Scale Greens' function of the underlying symmetric problem. The proposed approach involves solving the VMS problem on two separate meshes: a coarse mesh for the full PDE and a fine mesh for the symmetric part of the continuous differential operator. We consider the 1D and 2D steady advection-diffusion problems in both direct and mixed formulations as the test cases in this paper. Moreover, we demonstrate the working of this method using the Mimetic Spectral Element Method (MSEM), however, it may be applied to other Finite/Spectral Element or Isogeometric frameworks. Furthermore, we propose that VMS should not be viewed as a stabilisation technique; instead, the base scheme should be inherently stable, with VMS enhancing the solution quality by supplementing the base scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a shape optimization based method for finding the best interpolation data in the compression of images with noise. The aim is to reconstruct missing regions by means of minimizing a data fitting term in an $L^p$-norm between original images and their reconstructed counterparts using linear diffusion PDE-based inpainting. Reformulating the problem as a constrained optimization over sets (shapes), we derive the topological asymptotic expansion of the considered shape functionals with respect to the insertion of small ball (a single pixel) using the adjoint method. Based on the achieved distributed topological shape derivatives, we propose a numerical approach to determine the optimal set and present numerical experiments showing, the efficiency of our method. Numerical computations are presented that confirm the usefulness of our theoretical findings for PDE-based image compression.</description>

      <title>An inexact infeasible arc-search interior-point method for linear programming problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inexact interior-point methods (IPMs) are a type of interior-point methods that inexactly solve the linear equation system for obtaining the search direction. On the other hand, arc-search IPMs approximate the central path with an ellipsoidal arc obtained by solving two linear equation systems in each iteration, while conventional line-search
  IPMs solve one linear system. Therefore, the improvement due to the inexact solutions of the linear equation systems can be more beneficial in arc-search IPMs than conventional IPMs. In this paper, we propose an inexact infeasible arc-search interior-point method. We establish that the proposed method is a polynomial-time algorithm through its convergence analysis. The numerical experiments for the large benchmark problems show that the proposed method using the conjugate gradient method as the inexact linear system solver can reduce both of the number of iterations and the computation time compared to the existing inexact IPM due to the reduction in computational complexity by the arc-search. Andmore, it can reduce the computation time compared to the existing exact IPMs because the dependence of the computational complexity on the dimension $n$ of the coefficient matrix is smaller for the conjugate gradient method than for the Cholesky factorization.</description>

      <title>Some Results on Neural Network Stability, Consistency, and Convergence: Insights into Non-IID Data, High-Dimensional Settings, and Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses critical challenges in machine learning, particularly the stability, consistency, and convergence of neural networks under non-IID data, distribution shifts, and high-dimensional settings. We provide new theoretical results on uniform stability for neural networks with dynamic learning rates in non-convex settings. Further, we establish consistency bounds for federated learning models in non-Euclidean spaces, accounting for distribution shifts and curvature effects. For Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we derive stability, consistency, and convergence guarantees for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in noisy environments. These results fill significant gaps in understanding model behavior in complex, non-ideal conditions, paving the way for more robust and reliable machine learning applications.</description>
