      <title>Differentiable Graph Neural Network Simulator for the Back-Analysis of Post-Liquefaction Residual Strength from Flow Failure Runout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces Differentiable Graph Neural Network Simulators (Diff-GNS) as a physics-informed and automated framework for estimating post-liquefaction residual strengths ($S_r$). Traditional approaches to estimate $S_r$ rely on simplified physics, manual iterations, and assumptions about runout development. Diff-GNS overcomes these limitations by integrating a Graph Neural Network Simulator (GNS) that simulates granular flows, with gradient-based optimization through automatic differentiation. GNS accelerates forward runout simulations that are otherwise computationally intensive with conventional numerical methods, while gradient-based optimization automates the inversion to back-calculate $S_r$. The GNS is trained on simulations with the material point method on geometries informed by case-history runout failures, enabling focused learning of realistic runout mechanisms and the ability to simulate slopes across small and large scales. The Diff-GNS framework is validated using two well-documented liquefaction-induced flow failure case histories: the Lower San Fernando dam and La Marquesa dam. In the two cases, the inferred $S_r$ agrees closely with published estimates and reproduces physically consistent runout behaviors. The framework also has the ability to jointly infer multiple interacting parameters, extending beyond single-parameter back-analyses. By embedding the physics of runout processes, minimizing manual intervention, and accelerating the inversion process to estimate $S_r$, Diff-GNS provides an efficient, reproducible, and physically grounded approach for geotechnical analysis of liquefaction-induced flow failures.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Reciprocity in Operator Learning for Seismic Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient wavefield modeling underpins seismic structure and source studies. Traditional methods comply with physical laws but are computationally intensive. Data-driven methods, while opening new avenues for advancement, have yet to incorporate strict physical consistency. The principle of reciprocity is one of the most fundamental physical laws in wave propagation. We introduce the Reciprocity-Enforced Neural Operator (RENO), a transformer-based architecture for modeling seismic wave propagation that hard-codes the reciprocity principle. The model leverages the cross-attention mechanism and commutative operations to guarantee invariance under swapping source and receiver positions. Beyond improved physical consistency, the proposed architecture supports simultaneous realizations for multiple sources without crosstalk issues. This yields an order-of-magnitude inference speedup at a similar memory footprint over an reciprocity-unenforced neural operator on a realistic configuration. We demonstrate the functionality using the reciprocity relation for particle velocity fields under single forces. This architecture is also applicable to pressure fields under dilatational sources and travel-time fields governed by the eikonal equation, paving the way for encoding more complex reciprocity relations.</description>

      <title>pycopm: An open-source tool to tailor OPM Flow geological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir simulations help the energy industry make better decisions by predicting how fluids like oil, gas, water, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide will flow underground. To keep these predictions accurate, engineers often need to update geological models quickly as new information becomes available. pycopm is a tool designed to make this process faster and easier. It allows users to adjust geological models in several ways, such as simplifying complex grids, focusing on specific parts of a reservoir, or changing the shape and position of the model. These capabilities help engineers test different scenarios efficiently. Although pycopm was first used on two well-known public datasets, it has since become useful in many other situations because of its easy-to-use features and recent extensions. Today, it supports studies involving model refinement, comparing coarse and detailed models, analyzing interactions between nearby sites, and speeding up troubleshooting in large simulations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Testing of a Hybrid Machine Learning-Physics Global Atmosphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based models have demonstrated high skill and computational efficiency, often outperforming conventional physics-based models in weather and subseasonal predictions. While prior studies have assessed their fidelity in capturing synoptic-scale atmospheric dynamics, their performance across timescales and under out-of-distribution forcing, such as +3K or +4K uniform-warming forcings, and the sources of biases remain elusive, to establish the model reliability for Earth science. Here, we design three sets of experiments targeting synoptic-scale phenomena, interannual variability, and out-of-distribution uniform-warming forcings. We evaluate the Neural General Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid model integrating a dynamical core with ML-based component, against observations and physics-based Earth system models (ESMs). At the synoptic scale, NeuralGCM captures the evolution and propagation of extratropical cyclones with performance comparable to ESMs. At the interannual scale, when forced by El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, NeuralGCM successfully reproduces associated teleconnection patterns but exhibits deficiencies in capturing nonlinear response. Under out-of-distribution uniform-warming forcings, NeuralGCM simulates similar responses in global-average temperature and precipitation and reproduces large-scale tropospheric circulation features similar to those in ESMs. Notable weaknesses include overestimating the tracks and spatial extent of extratropical cyclones, biases in the teleconnected wave train triggered by tropical SST anomalies, and differences in upper-level warming and stratospheric circulation responses to SST warming compared to physics-based ESMs. The causes of these weaknesses were explored.</description>

      <title>Efficient parallel finite-element methods for planetary gravitation: DtN and multipole expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Poisson equation governing a planet's gravitational field is posed on the unbounded domain, $\mathbb{R}^3$, whereas finite-element computations require bounded meshes. We implement and compare three strategies for handling the infinite exterior in the finite-element method: (i) naive domain truncation; (ii) Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map on a truncated boundary; (iii) multipole expansion on a truncated boundary. While all these methods are known within the geophysical literature, we discuss their parallel implementations within modern open-source finite-element codes, focusing specifically on the widely-used MFEM package. We consider both calculating the gravitational potential for a static density structure and computing the linearised perturbation to the potential caused by a displacement field - a necessary step for coupling self-gravitation into planetary dynamics. In contrast to some earlier studies, we find that the domain truncation method can provide accurate solutions at an acceptable cost, with suitable coarsening of the mesh within the exterior domain. Nevertheless, the DtN and multipole methods provide superior accuracy at a lower cost within large-scale parallel geophysical simulations despite their need for non-local communication associated with spherical harmonic expansions. The DtN method, in particular, admits an efficient parallel implementation based on an MPI-communicator limited to processors that contain part of the mesh's outer boundary. A series of further illustrative calculations are provided to show the potential of the DtN and multipole methods within realistic geophysical modelling.</description>

      <title>Function-Space Decoupled Diffusion for Forward and Inverse Modeling in Carbon Capture and Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface flow is critical for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) but remains challenged by the ill-posed nature of inverse problems with sparse observations. We present Fun-DDPS, a generative framework that combines function-space diffusion models with differentiable neural operator surrogates for both forward and inverse modeling. Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation. We demonstrate Fun-DDPS on synthetic CCS modeling datasets, achieving two key results: (1) For forward modeling with only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error compared to 86.9% for standard surrogates (an 11x improvement), proving its capability to handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic methods fail. (2) We provide the first rigorous validation of diffusion-based inverse solvers against asymptotically exact Rejection Sampling (RS) posteriors. Both Fun-DDPS and the joint-state baseline (Fun-DPS) achieve Jensen-Shannon divergence less than 0.06 against the ground truth. Crucially, Fun-DDPS produces physically consistent realizations free from the high-frequency artifacts observed in joint-state baselines, achieving this with 4x improved sample efficiency compared to rejection sampling.</description>
