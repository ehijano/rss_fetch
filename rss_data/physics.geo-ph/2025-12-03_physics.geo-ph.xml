      <title>Leveraging generative adversarial networks with spatially adaptive denormalization for multivariate stochastic seismic data inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic seismic inverse modeling often requires the prediction of both spatially correlated geological heterogeneities (e.g., facies) and continuous parameters (e.g., rock and elastic properties). Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an efficient training-image-based simulation framework capable of reproducing complex geological models with high accuracy and comparably low generative cost. However, their application in stochastic geophysical inversion for multivariate property prediction is limited, as representing multiple coupled properties requires large and unstable networks with high memory and training demands. A more recent variant of GANs with spatially adaptive denormalization (SPADE-GAN) enables the direct conditioning of facies spatial distributions on local probability maps. Leveraging on such features, an iterative geostatistical inversion algorithm is proposed, SPADE-GANInv, integrating a pre-trained SPADE-GAN with geostatistical simulation, for the prediction of facies and multiple correlated continuous properties from seismic data. The SPADE-GAN is trained to reproduce realistic facies geometries, while sequential stochastic co-simulation predicts the spatial variability of the facies-dependent continuous properties. At each iteration, a set of subsurface realizations is generated and used to compute synthetic seismic data. The realizations providing the highest similarity coefficient to the observed data are used to update the subsurface probability models in the next iteration. The method is demonstrated on both 2-D synthetic scenarios and field data, targeting the prediction of facies, porosity, and acoustic impedance from full-stack seismic data. Results show that the algorithm enables accurate multivariate prediction, mitigates the impact of biased prior data, and accommodates additional local conditioning such as well logs.</description>

      <title>Remotely sensing stress evolution in elastic media: a passive approach to earthquake monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00268v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stress evolution governs material failure across scales, from microscopic fractures to large earthquakes, yet direct observation of its dynamics in natural systems has remained elusive. Laboratory experiments using active ultrasonic measurements have shown that seismic velocity and attenuation are sensitive to stress, but such monitoring has not previously been achievable remotely or passively.
  Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transform that enables passive monitoring of stress evolution using ambient seismic or acoustic noise. The method quantifies relative energy shifts between adjacent frequency bands, capturing subtle changes in wave-propagation properties linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied across scales, from laboratory stick-slip and slow-slip experiments to natural fault systems including the 2018 Kilauea collapse, Cascadia slow-slip episodes, and major earthquakes such as the 2011 Tohoku, 2010 Maule, 2002 Denali, and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals distinctive precursory trajectories and stress-cycle patterns.
  These results demonstrate that stress evolution in elastic Earth materials can be remotely and passively monitored, bridging laboratory rock physics and large-scale seismology and offering a new foundation for real-time tracking of fault mechanics and earthquake preparation.</description>

      <title>Vessel Detection and Localization Using Distributed Acoustic Sensing in Submarine Optical Fiber Cables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submarine cables play a critical role in global internet connectivity, energy transmission, and communication but remain vulnerable to accidental damage and sabotage. Recent incidents in the Baltic Sea highlighted the need for enhanced monitoring to protect this vital infrastructure. Traditional vessel detection methods, such as synthetic aperture radar, video surveillance, and multispectral satellite imagery, face limitations in real-time processing, adverse weather conditions, and coverage range. This paper explores Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) as an alternative by repurposing submarine telecommunication cables as large-scale acoustic sensor arrays. DAS offers continuous real-time monitoring, operates independently of cooperative systems like the "Automatic Identification System" (AIS), being largely unaffected by lighting or weather conditions. However, existing research on DAS for vessel tracking is limited in scale and lacks validation under real-world conditions. To address these gaps, a general and systematic methodology is presented for vessel detection and distance estimation using DAS. Advanced machine learning models are applied to improve detection and localization accuracy in dynamic maritime environments. The approach is evaluated over a continuous ten-day period, covering diverse ship and operational conditions, representing one of the largest-scale DAS-based vessel monitoring studies to date, and for which we release the full evaluation dataset. Results demonstrate DAS as a practical tool for maritime surveillance, with an overall F1-score of over 90% in vessel detection, and a mean average error of 141 m for vessel distance estimation, bridging the gap between experimental research and real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Slip, Differentiate, Observe: State and Parameter Estimation for Rate and State Friction from Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying frictional properties of interfaces remains a major challenge in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial geomechanics, where available samples, laboratory apparatuses, and geophysical observations are inherently limited. We introduce an analytic and numerical framework, grounded in nonlinear control theory, to infer the emergent frictional behavior of seismic faults. From noisy slip measurements, we first reconstruct the slip rate and frictional response in finite time using a Robust Exact Filtering Differentiator (REFD) that attenuates measurement noise. Building on these reconstructions, we design an exponentially convergent adaptive-gain observer that estimates the internal state variable and the key parameters (a - b) and dc of the rate-and-state friction (RSF) law, widely used in fault mechanics. Numerical experiments show that, in fast slip regimes where data are sufficiently rich, the method recovers RSF parameters with errors on the order of 20% and accurately tracks the RSF state variable despite noise contamination, whereas slowly varying sliding periods lack the observability required for reliable estimation. We also establish observability and identifiability conditions for the extended system, enabling the determination of additional parameters and outlining pathways for more advanced control-theoretic approaches to friction and state identification in fault systems. Although we apply the approach to a reduced spring-slider analogue, it improves on classical RSF calibration methods that depend on laboratory access to shear and normal stress. It also offers convergence guarantees and explicit error bounds, and it can further support model-based inversions that embed RSF in forward simulations.</description>

      <title>Interplay of non-standard interactions and Earth's composition in atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many geophysical and geochemical phenomena in the Earth's interior are related to physical and chemical processes in the outer core and the core-mantle boundary, which are directly linked to the isotopic composition. Determining the composition using standard geophysical methods has been challenging. Atmospheric neutrino oscillations, influenced by their weak interactions with terrestrial matter, offer a new way to gather valuable information about the Earth's internal structure and, in particular, to constrain the composition of the core. If neutrinos had as yet unknown non-standard interactions (NSI), this could affect their propagation in matter and consequently impact studies of Earth's composition using neutrino oscillation tomography. This study focuses on scalar-mediated NSI and their potential impact on atmospheric neutrino oscillations, which could obscure information about the hydrogen content in the outer core. In turn, compositional uncertainties could affect the characterization of NSI parameters. The analysis is based on a Monte-Carlo simulation of the energy distribution and azimuthal angles of neutrino-generated $\mu$ events. Using a model of the Earth consisting of 55 concentric shells with constant densities determined from the PREM, we evaluate the effect on the number of events due to changes in the outer core composition (Z/A)$_{oc}$ and the NSI strength parameter $\epsilon$. To examine the detection capability to observe such variations, we consider regions in the plane of (Z/A)$_{oc}$ and $\epsilon$ where the statistical significance of the discrepancies between the modified Earth model and the reference model is less than $1\sigma$.</description>

      <title>On the planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo: Evidence from a Lagrangian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether planetary motions influence the solar magnetic cycle has remained an open question due to the lack of a rigorous physical mechanism. Here we develop a Lagrangian framework based on the Virial theorem to show that planetary orbital angular momentum modulates the Sun's rotation through barycentric dynamics, consistent with angular momentum conservation. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to sunspot number (SSN) and terrestrial length-of-day (LOD) records spanning the past 250 years, we identify two non-linear trends plus 11 common pseudo-cycles whose periods match those of planetary resonances (LR$^{*}$). We then demonstrate that a reduced nonlinear $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo model, forced solely by the summed planetary right ascension RA(t), reproduces both the Schwabe cycle and its multi-decadal envelope, including the Dalton Minimum and the Modern Maximum. These results provide strong evidence, based on a physically-grounded model, that the solar dynamo is weakly forced by planetary motion, suggesting that the solar dynamo, classically viewed as autonomous, may in fact behave as a synchronized system.</description>
