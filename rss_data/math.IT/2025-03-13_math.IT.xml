      <title>Channel Estimation for Rydberg Atomic Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of the quantum technology presents huge opportunities for 6G communications. Leveraging the quantum properties of highly excited Rydberg atoms, Rydberg atom-based antennas present distinct advantages, such as high sensitivity, broad frequency range, and compact size, over traditional antennas. To realize efficient precoding, accurate channel state information is essential. However, due to the distinct characteristics of atomic receivers, traditional channel estimation algorithms developed for conventional receivers are no longer applicable. To this end, we propose a novel channel estimation algorithm based on projection gradient descent (PGD), which is applicable to both one-dimensional (1D) and twodimensional (2D) arrays. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation method.</description>

      <title>Phase-mismatched STAR-RIS with FAS-assisted RSMA Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers communication between a base station (BS) to two users, each from one side of a simultaneously transmitting-reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in the absence of a direct link. Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) strategy is employed and the STAR-RIS is subjected to phase errors. The users are equipped with a planar fluid antenna system (FAS) with position reconfigurability for spatial diversity. First, we derive the distribution of the equivalent channel gain at the FAS-equipped users, characterized by a t-distribution. We then obtain analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and average capacity (AC), with the latter obtained via a heuristic approach. Our findings highlight the potential of FAS to mitigate phase imperfections in STAR-RIS-assisted communications, significantly enhancing system performance compared to traditional antenna systems (TAS). Also, we quantify the impact of practical phase errors on system efficiency, emphasizing the importance of robust strategies for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>New construction of Locally Perfect Nonlinear Functions with Application to Sequences Sets with Low Ambiguity Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Ambiguity Zone (LAZ) sequences play a pivotal role in modern integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Recently, Wang et al.[1] proposed a definition of locally perfect nonlinear functions (LPNFs) and constructed three classes of both periodic and aperiodic LAZ sequence sets with flexible parameters by applying such functions and interleaving method. Some of these LAZ sequence sets are asymptotically optimal with respect to the Ye-Zhou-Liu-Fan-Lei-Tang bounds undercertain conditions. In this paper, we proceed with the construction of LPNFs with new parameters. By using these LPNFs, we also present a series of LAZ sequence sets with more flexible parameters, addressing the limitations of existing parameter choices. Furthermore, our results show that one of these classes is asymptotically optimal in both the periodic and aperiodic cases, respectively.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Statistical Analysis of the DoF of Continuous Linear Arrays in the Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the number of communication modes, that is, the degrees of freedom (DoF), in a wireless setup comprising a small continuous linear intelligent antenna array in the near field of a large one. The framework allows for any orientations between the arrays and any positions in a two-dimensional space assuming that the transmitting array is placed at the origin. Therefore, apart from the length of the two continuous arrays, four key parameters determine the DoF and are hence considered in the analysis: the Cartesian coordinates of the center of the receiving array and two angles that model the rotation of each array around its center. The paper starts with the calculation of the deterministic DoF for a generic geometric setting, which extends beyond the widely studied paraxial case. Subsequently, a stochastic geometry framework is proposed to study the statistical DoF, as a first step towards the investigation of the system-level performance in near field networks. Numerical results applied to millimeter wave networks reveal the large number of DoF provided by near-field communications and unveiled key system-level insights.</description>

      <title>Optimal ISAC Beamforming Structure and Efficient Algorithms for Sum Rate and CRLB Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a promising paradigm to unify wireless communications and radar sensing, enabling efficient spectrum and hardware utilization. A core challenge with realizing the gains of ISAC stems from the unique challenges of dual purpose beamforming design due to the highly non-convex nature of key performance metrics such as sum rate for communications and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity structured approach to ISAC beamforming optimization to simultaneously enhance spectral efficiency and estimation accuracy. Specifically, we develop a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm which transforms the original non-convex problem into a sequence of convex subproblems ensuring convergence to a locally optimal solution. Furthermore, leveraging the proposed SCA framework and the Lagrange duality, we derive the optimal beamforming structure for CRLB optimization in ISAC systems. Our findings characterize the reduction in radar streams one can employ without affecting performance. This enables a dimensionality reduction that enhances computational efficiency. Numerical simulations validate that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance to the considered benchmarks while requiring much lower computational costs.</description>

      <title>A Note on Clifford Stabilizer Codes for Ising Anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a streamlined elaboration on existing ideas that link Ising anyon (or equivalently, Majorana) stabilizer codes to certain classes of binary classical codes. The groundwork for such Majorana-based quantum codes can be found in earlier works (including, for example, Bravyi (arXiv:1004.3791) and Vijay et al. (arXiv:1703.00459)), where it was observed that commuting families of fermionic (Clifford) operators can can often be systematically lifted from weakly self-dual or self-orthogonal binary codes. Here, we recast and unify these ideas into a classification theorem that explicitly shows how explicitly shows how q-isotropic subspaces in $\mathbb{F}_2^{2n}$ yield commuting Clifford operators relevant to Ising anyons, and how these subspaces naturally correspond to punctured self-orthogonal codes in $\mathbb{F}_2^{2n+1}$.</description>

      <title>Fundamental work costs of preparation and erasure in the presence of quantum side information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thought experiment of Maxwell's demon highlights the effect of side information in thermodynamics. In this paper, we present an axiomatic treatment of a quantum Maxwell's demon, by introducing a resource-theoretic framework of quantum thermodynamics in the presence of quantum side information. Under minimal operational assumptions that capture the demon's behaviour, we derive the one-shot work costs of preparing, as well as erasing, a thermodynamic system whose coupling with the demon's mind is described by a bipartite quantum state. With trivial Hamiltonians, these work costs are precisely captured by the smoothed conditional min- and max-entropies, respectively, thus providing operational interpretations for these one-shot information-theoretic quantities in microscopic thermodynamics. An immediate, information-theoretic implication of our results is an affirmative proof of the conjectured maximality of the conditional max-entropy among all axiomatically plausible conditional entropies, complementing the recently established minimality of the conditional min-entropy. We then generalize our main results to the setting with nontrivial Hamiltonians, wherein the work costs of preparation and erasure are captured by a generalized type of mutual information. Finally, we present a macroscopic second law of thermodynamics in the presence of quantum side information, in terms of a conditional version of the Helmholtz free energy. Our results extend the conceptual connection between thermodynamics and quantum information theory by refining the axiomatic common ground between the two theories and revealing fundamental insights of each theory in light of the other.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Feature Selection from Variable Feature Sets Using Features of Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models usually assume that a set of feature values used to obtain an output is fixed in advance. However, in many real-world problems, a cost is associated with measuring these features. To address the issue of reducing measurement costs, various methods have been proposed to dynamically select which features to measure, but existing methods assume that the set of measurable features remains constant, which makes them unsuitable for cases where the set of measurable features varies from instance to instance. To overcome this limitation, we define a new problem setting for Dynamic Feature Selection (DFS) with variable feature sets and propose a deep learning method that utilizes prior information about each feature, referred to as ''features of features''. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively selects features based on the prior information, even when the set of measurable features changes from instance to instance.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimality of the Probability Flow ODE for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have become a foundational paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in generating samples from complex high-dimensional distributions. Despite the dominant adoption of probability flow ODE-based samplers in practice due to their superior sampling efficiency and precision, rigorous statistical guarantees for these methods have remained elusive in the literature. This work develops the first end-to-end theoretical framework for deterministic ODE-based samplers that establishes near-minimax optimal guarantees under mild assumptions on target data distributions. Specifically, focusing on subgaussian distributions with $\beta$-H\"older smooth densities for $\beta\leq 2$, we propose a smooth regularized score estimator that simultaneously controls both the $L^2$ score error and the associated mean Jacobian error. Leveraging this estimator within a refined convergence analysis of the ODE-based sampling process, we demonstrate that the resulting sampler achieves the minimax rate in total variation distance, modulo logarithmic factors. Notably, our theory comprehensively accounts for all sources of error in the sampling process and does not require strong structural conditions such as density lower bounds or Lipschitz/smooth scores on target distributions, thereby covering a broad range of practical data distributions.</description>

      <title>Secret-Key Agreement Using Physical Identifiers for Degraded and Less Noisy Authentication Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10478v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secret-key agreement based on biometric or physical identifiers is a promising security protocol for authenticating users or devices with small chips due to its lightweight security. In previous studies, the fundamental limits of such a protocol were analyzed, and the results showed that two auxiliary random variables were involved in the capacity region expressions. However, with these two auxiliary random variables, the complexity of computing the capacity regions may be prohibitively high. To deal with this problem, we explore classes of authentication channels that require only one auxiliary random variable in the expressions of the capacity regions. It is revealed that for the classes of degraded and less noisy authentication channels, a single auxiliary random variable is sufficient to express the capacity regions. As specific examples, we derive the closed-form expressions for binary and Gaussian sources. Also, numerical calculations for Gaussian sources are provided to show the trade-off between secret-key and privacy-leakage rates under a given storage rate, and to illustrate how the noise in the enrollment phase affects the capacity region.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Beam Squint Effect For Near-Field Wideband Communication Through Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this correspondence, we study deploying movable antenna (MA) array in a wideband multiple-input-single-output (MISO) communication system, where near-field (NF) channel model is considered. To alleviate beam squint effect, we propose to maximize the minimum analog beamforming gain across the entire wideband spectrum by appropriately adjusting MAs' positions, which is a highly challenging task. By introducing a slack variable and adopting the cutting-the-edge smoothed-gradient-descent-ascent (SGDA) method, we develop algorithms to resolve the aforementioned challenge. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the benefit of utilizing MA array to mitigate beam squint effect in NF wideband system.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Measures on Lattices for High-Order Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional measures based solely on pairwise associations often fail to capture the complex statistical structure of multivariate data. Existing approaches for identifying information shared among $d&gt;3$ variables are frequently computationally intractable, asymmetric with respect to a target variable, or unable to account for all the ways in which the joint probability distribution can be factorised. Here we present a systematic framework based on lattice theory to derive higher-order information-theoretic measures for multivariate data. Our construction uses lattice and operator function pairs, whereby an operator function is applied over a lattice that represents the algebraic relationships among variables. We show that many commonly used measures can be derived within this framework, yet they fail to capture all interactions for $d&gt;3$, either because they are defined on restricted sublattices, or because the use of the KL divergence as an operator function, a typical choice, leads to undesired disregard of groups of interactions. To fully characterise all interactions among $d$ variables, we introduce the Streitberg Information, which is defined over the full partition lattice and uses generalised divergences (beyond KL) as operator functions. We validate the Streitberg Information on synthetic data, and illustrate its application in detecting complex interactions among stocks, decoding neural signals, and performing feature selection in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Learned Recognizer with Customized RIS Phases and Sensing Durations</title>

Abstract: Future wireless communication networks are expected to be smarter and more aware of their surroundings, enabling a wide range of context-aware applications. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are set to play a critical role in supporting various sensing tasks, such as target recognition. However, current methods typically use RIS configurations optimized once and applied over fixed sensing durations, limiting their ability to adapt to different targets and reducing sensing accuracy. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an advanced wireless communication system that multiplexes downlink signals for environmental sensing and introduces an intelligent recognizer powered by deep learning techniques. Specifically, we design a novel neural network based on the long short-term memory architecture and the physical channel model. This network iteratively captures and fuses information from previous measurements, adaptively customizing RIS phases to gather the most relevant information for the recognition task at subsequent moments. These configurations are dynamically adjusted according to scene, task, target, and quantization priors. Furthermore, the recognizer includes a decision-making module that dynamically allocates different sensing durations, determining whether to continue or terminate the sensing process based on the collected measurements. This approach maximizes resource utilization efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques while minimizing the impact on communication performance, even when sensing and communication occur simultaneously.

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Device-to-Device Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.03344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose to employ reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for enhancing the D2D underlaying system performance. We study the joint power control, receive beamforming, and passive beamforming for RIS assisted D2D underlaying cellular communication systems, which is formulated as a sum rate maximization problem. To address this issue, we develop a block coordinate descent method where uplink power, receive beamformer and refection phase shifts are alternatively optimized. Then, we provide the closed-form solutions for both uplink power and receive beamformer. We further propose a quadratic transform based semi-definite relaxation algorithm to optimize the RIS phase shifts, where the original passive beamforming problem is translated into a separable quadratically constrained quadratic problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RIS assisted design significantly improves the sum-rate performance.</description>
