      <title>Optical sound pressure measurement using Fabry-p\'erot cavity for primary acoustic standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical sound pressure measurement is a promising technology to establish primary acoustic standards without reliance on specific types of microphones. We developed a precision optical sound pressure measurement system by combining a Fabry-p\'erot optical cavity, a phase-stabilized optical frequency comb, and a custom-made phasemeter. The optical cavity detects changes in the air's refractive index induced by sound waves as changes in its resonance frequency. A continuous-wave laser frequency is stabilized at the resonance, and the frequency comb detects the changes in the laser frequency. The frequency changes are measured with high sensitivity and accuracy using a phasemeter that we developed. The sound pressures measured by this system agreed with the measurement value obtained using a reference microphone within 5% at sound pressure levels of 78 dB and 84 dB, within a frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 kHz. A systematic deviation of 2.6% was observed, with the optical system yielding higher values than the microphone. To identify the cause of this deviation, we performed vibration displacement measurements of the cavity mirrors and finite element analysis, which revealed that fluctuations in the optical path length due to insufficient fixation of the mirrors were responsible.</description>

      <title>Development of a national thrust test facility for electric propulsion at Robinson Research Institute, New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Robinson Research Institute is developing a type of electric propulsion for spacecraft called an applied-field magneto-plasma-dynamic (AF-MPD) thruster. The applied field module of the thruster features a cryocooler-cooled high-temperature-superconducting (HTS) magnet generating central fields exceeding 1 Tesla. This paper reports on the progress to date of the thruster test facilities established at the Institute to enable development of the AF-MPD and electric propulsion in general. The vacuum facilities consist primarily of a 1 m diameter, 3 m3 cylindrical chamber with a high-vacuum pumping speed, measured to be about 4200 L/s (Ar). The chamber can be reduced from atmospheric pressure to 1E10-5 hPa in about 2 h, enabling a rapid testing turn-around time, and maintains 5E10-4 hPa during thruster operation at typical mass flow rates of 5 mg/s (Ar). A pendulum thrust-stand has been purpose built to withstands static thruster loads of up to 30 kg and measure thrust forces up to 200 mN. It is also designed to be inherently insensitive to the unique challenges of measuring AF-MPD with superconducting magnets; strong magnetic fields, cryocooler vibration, and the thermal gradients. Initial thrust-stand testing, whilst implementing both water-cooling and a cryocooler showed it to be capable of measuring forces to a precision of approximately 1 mN and with an absolute accuracy of +/-2.3 mN (full scale). An extensive suite of software tools has also been developed to coordinate the large set of instruments needed to run the vacuum facilities, the thrust-stand, HTS magnet and cryocooler in addition to the many other auxiliary- and logging systems. Various upgrades to the facilities are in progress or planned.</description>

      <title>Design and performance of the prototype gaseous beam monitor with GEM and pixel sensors for the CSR external-target experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gaseous beam monitor utilizing gas electron multiplier (GEM) and pixel sensors is being developed for the Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External-target Experiment (CEE) at Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL). The beam monitor is mainly used to track each beam particle, providing an accurate reconstruction of the primary vertex of the collision. Two generations of the pixel sensors (named Topmetal-CEE) were produced, with the second generation's performance improving over the first one. The design and performance of the prototype are described in the paper. Characterization of the prototype with heavy-ion beams and laser beams are presented, showing a spatial resolution better than 50 $\mum$ and a time resolution better than 15 ns.</description>

      <title>Simulation of radiation environment for the beam monitor of CEE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cooling storage ring external-target experiment is a large-scale nuclear physics experiment, which aims to study the physics of heavy-ion collisions at low temperatures and high baryon densities. A beam monitor (BM) is placed in the beam line to monitor the beam status and to improve the reconstruction resolution of the primary vertices. The radiation dose and particle fluence stemming from the beam interactions with gases and detector materials affect the performance of the sensors and electronics of BM. This paper uses FLUKA Monte Carlo code to simulate the radiation environment of BM detector. Radiation quantities including the total ionizing dose, 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence, high-energy hadron flux, thermal neutron flux, and nuclear fragment flux are presented. Results of alternative simulation setups, including adding shielding layers inside the BM, are also investigated.</description>

      <title>A Geometrically Consistent Matching Framework for Side-Scan Sonar Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust matching of side scan sonar imagery remains a fundamental challenge in seafloor mapping due to view dependent backscatter, shadows, and geometric distortion. This paper proposes a novel matching framework that combines physical decoupling and geometric consistency to enhance correspondence accuracy and consistency across viewpoints. A self supervised multi branch network, derived from the Lambertian reflection model, decomposes raw sonar images into seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss. The reflectivity map, serving as a stable matching domain, is used in conjunction with a training-free matching pipeline combining SuperPoint and MINIMA LightGlue. Geometry aware outlier rejection leverages both terrain elevation and its physically derived shadow map to further remove mismatches in acoustically occluded and topographically inconsistent regions, thereby improving registration accuracy. Quantitative and visual evaluations against traditional, CNN, and Transformer based state of the art methods demonstrate that our method achieves lower matching error, higher geometric consistency, and greater robustness to viewpoint variations. The proposed approach provides a data efficient, physically interpretable solution for high precision side scan sonar image matching in complex seafloor environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electromagnetic Calorimeter Signal Reconstruction with Machine Learning-Based Noise Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calorimeters operating in high-radiation environments are susceptible to damage, leading to increased noise that can significantly degrade energy resolution. A common way to mitigate noise is to apply a higher energy threshold on the cells, typically set a few standard deviations above the noise level. However, this method risks discarding cells with genuine energy deposits, worsening the energy resolution. In this paper we explore various machine learning (ML) algorithms that can replace a rigid threshold on the reconstructed cell energy and we demonstrate the improvement in calorimetric energy reconstruction and energy resolution that these ML methods can achieve in such challenging conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter sensing enabled by modular fibre-optic assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry is transitioning from manually monitored components and processes to data-driven solutions. At the heart of this transformation is predictive maintenance, which relies on simultaneous, real-time monitoring of key operational parameters such as temperature and vibration to anticipate and prevent equipment failures. In this work, we present a modular approach to fibre-optic sensing, where different types of optical fibres and other wires are combined to compact, hybrid cable assemblies, customized for each application. These fibre-optic assemblies can be embedded or integrated in various settings, enabling multi-parameter sensing and the measurement of new parameters.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Electron and Hole Drift Velocities in thin 4H-SiC PIN Detectors using High-Frequency Readout Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) has been widely adopted in the semiconductor industry, particularly in power electronics, because of its high temperature stability, high breakdown field, and fast switching speeds. Its wide band gap makes it an interesting candidate for radiation-hard particle detectors in high-energy physics and medical applications. Furthermore, the high electron and hole drift velocities in 4H-SiC enable devices suitable for ultra-fast particle detection and timing applications. However, currently, the front-end readout electronics used for 4H-SiC detectors constitute a bottleneck in investigations of the charge carrier drift. To address these limitations, a high-frequency readout board with an intrinsic bandwidth of 10 GHz was developed. With this readout, the transient current signals of a 4H-SiC diode with a diameter of 141 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a thickness of 50 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ upon UV-laser, alpha particle, and high-energy proton beam excitation were recorded. In all three cases, the electron and hole drift can clearly be separated, which enables the extraction of the charge carrier drift velocities as a function of the electric field. These velocities, for the first time directly measured, provide a valuable comparison to Monte-Carlo simulated literature values and constitute an essential input for TCAD simulations. Finally, a complete simulation environment combining TCAD, the Allpix$^2$ framework, and SPICE simulations is presented, in good agreement with the measured data.</description>

      <title>Exploring the performance of SiPM at cryogenic temperature for the sub-meV threshold detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new detector concept that uses the decoupling of superconducting Cooper pairs to detect particles, which has a theoretical energy threshold at the sub-meV level. However, quasiparticles decoupled from Cooper pairs in superconductors is difficult to detect using conventional photoelectric devices, since the binding energy of Cooper pairs is at the sub-meV scale. A key challenge is reading out quasiparticle signals at cryogenic temperatures. Therefore, we firstly investigate the performance of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at a cryogenic temperature of 10~mK, and observed that the dark count rate drops by seven orders of magnitude compared to room temperature, while the gain decreases by only a factor of 4.44. In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of the SiPM's performance at 10~mK, including breakdown voltage, second breakdown and operating voltage range, single-photoelectron gain and resolution, dark count rate, output waveform characteristics, and the probability of correlated signals. Based on these findings, we propose a conceptual framework for a sub-meV particle detector that uses electron multiplication in a PN junction for signal readout.</description>

      <title>Probing laser-driven surface and subsurface dynamics via grazing-incidence XFEL scattering and diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a grazing-incidence x-ray platform that simultaneously records time-resolved grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) and grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GID) from a femtosecond laser-irradiated gold film above the melting threshold, with picosecond resolution at an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). By tuning the x-ray incidence angle, the probe depth is set to tens of nanometers, enabling depth-selective sensitivity to near-surface dynamics. GISAXS resolves ultrafast changes in surface nanomorphology (correlation length, roughness), while GID quantifies subsurface lattice compression, grain orientation, melting, and recrystallization. The approach overcomes photon-flux limitations of synchrotron grazing-incidence geometries and provides stringent, time-resolved benchmarks for complex theoretical models of ultrafast laser-matter interaction and warm dense matter. Looking ahead, the same depth-selective methodology is well suited to inertial confinement fusion (ICF): it can visualize buried-interface perturbations and interfacial thermal resistance on micron to sub-micron scales that affect instability seeding and burn propagation.</description>

      <title>An Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a cavity optomechanical accelerometer to perform a resonant search for ultralight dark matter at acoustic frequencies near 39 kHz (a particle mass of $0.16$ neV/$c^2$). The accelerometer is based on a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane, cryogenically cooled to 4 K, with photothermal heating employed to scan the resonance frequency by $10^2$ detector linewidths. Leveraging shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation pressure feedback cooling, we realize an acceleration resolution of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a bandwidth of $30$ Hz near the fundamental test mass resonance. We find no evidence of a dark matter signal and infer an upper bound on the coupling to normal matter that is several orders of magnitude above the stringent bounds set by equivalence principle experiments. We outline a path toward novel dark matter constraints in future experiments by exploiting arrays of mass-loaded optomechanical sensors at lower temperature probed with distributed squeezed light.</description>

Abstract: Micro-objects levitated in a vacuum are an exciting platform for precision sensing due to their low dissipation motion and the potential for control at the quantum level. Arrays of such sensors would offer increased sensitivity, directionality, and in the quantum regime the potential to exploit correlation and entanglement.

      <title>High-resolution computed tomography of two-dimensional beam profile using dual-axis rotating wire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of a wire probe is a robust method for beam profile measurement, but it can only provide a 1D projection of the beam profile. In this study, we developed a novel method for measuring a beam projected from a 360{\deg} angle by a dual-axis rotation of a wire probe and obtaining a complete 2D profile via image reconstruction. We conducted a proof-of-principle study using an Ar+ ion beam and optimized the reconstruction algorithm. The experimental results showed that the use of the order subsets expectation maximization (OS-EM) algorithm is the most reasonable method, providing a highly accurate absolute 2D beam profile within a processing time on the millisecond scale. Furthermore, analysis of 2D profiles at different probing positions provided the beam direction and the phase space distribution. This versatile method can be applied to various fields of quantum beam technologies, such as particle therapy, semiconductor processing, and material analysis, as well as basic scientific research.</description>

      <title>QSHS: An Axion Dark Matter Resonant Search Apparatus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a resonant cavity search apparatus for axion dark matter constructed by the Quantum Sensors for the Hidden Sector (QSHS) collaboration. The apparatus is configured to search for QCD axion dark matter, though also has the capability to detect axion-like particles (ALPs), dark photons, and some other forms of wave-like dark matter. Initially, a tuneable cylindrical oxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier feeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator and threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also houses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and several other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning various prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion masses in the range 2.0 to 40 micro-eV/c2. The apparatus as currently configured is intended as a test stand for electronics over the relatively wide frequency band attainable with the TM010 cavity mode used for axion searches. We present performance data for the resonator, dilution refrigerator, and magnet, and plans for the first science run.</description>

      <title>Versatile luminescence macroscope with dynamic illumination for photoactive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Luminescence imaging is invaluable for studying biological and material systems, particularly when advanced protocols that exploit temporal dynamics are employed. However, implementing such protocols often requires custom instrumentation, either modified commercial systems or fully bespoke setups, which poses a barrier for researchers without expertise in optics, electronics, or software. To address this, we present a versatile macroscopic fluorescence imaging system capable of supporting a wide range of protocols, and provide detailed build instructions along with open-source software to enable replication with minimal prior experience. We demonstrate its broad utility through applications to plants, reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>JUNO 20-inch PMT and electronics system characterization using large pulses of PMT dark counts at the Pan-Asia testing platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of the JUNO experiment is to determine the neutrino mass ordering with a 20kt liquid-scintillator detector. The 20-inch PMT and its 1F3 (one for three) electronics are crucial to realize the excellent energy resolution of at least 3% at 1MeV. The knowledge on the PMT and 1F3 electronics response is critical for detector performance understanding. A study of the JUNO 20-inch PMT and 1F3 electronics system characterization is presented using large pulses of PMT dark count at the Pan-Asia testing platform in China. Thanks to its broad amplitude range and high rate, the large pulse signals are also used to investigate the PMT after pulse response.</description>
