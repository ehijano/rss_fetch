      <title>Refereeing the Referees: Evaluating Two-Sample Tests for Validating Generators in Precision Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a robust methodology to evaluate the performance and computational efficiency of non-parametric two-sample tests, specifically designed for high-dimensional generative models in scientific applications such as in particle physics. The study focuses on tests built from univariate integral probability measures: the sliced Wasserstein distance and the mean of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, already discussed in the literature, and the novel sliced Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. These metrics can be evaluated in parallel, allowing for fast and reliable estimates of their distribution under the null hypothesis. We also compare these metrics with the recently proposed unbiased Fr\'echet Gaussian Distance and the unbiased quadratic Maximum Mean Discrepancy, computed with a quartic polynomial kernel. We evaluate the proposed tests on various distributions, focusing on their sensitivity to deformations parameterized by a single parameter $\epsilon$. Our experiments include correlated Gaussians and mixtures of Gaussians in 5, 20, and 100 dimensions, and a particle physics dataset of gluon jets from the JetNet dataset, considering both jet- and particle-level features. Our results demonstrate that one-dimensional-based tests provide a level of sensitivity comparable to other multivariate metrics, but with significantly lower computational cost, making them ideal for evaluating generative models in high-dimensional settings. This methodology offers an efficient, standardized tool for model comparison and can serve as a benchmark for more advanced tests, including machine-learning-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards Representation Learning for Weighting Problems in Design-Based Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reweighting a distribution to minimize a distance to a target distribution is a powerful and flexible strategy for estimating a wide range of causal effects, but can be challenging in practice because optimal weights typically depend on knowledge of the underlying data generating process. In this paper, we focus on design-based weights, which do not incorporate outcome information; prominent examples include prospective cohort studies, survey weighting, and the weighting portion of augmented weighting estimators. In such applications, we explore the central role of representation learning in finding desirable weights in practice. Unlike the common approach of assuming a well-specified representation, we highlight the error due to the choice of a representation and outline a general framework for finding suitable representations that minimize this error. Building on recent work that combines balancing weights and neural networks, we propose an end-to-end estimation procedure that learns a flexible representation, while retaining promising theoretical properties. We show that this approach is competitive in a range of common causal inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Statistical tuning of artificial neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are often regarded as "black boxes" due to their complex functions and numerous parameters, which poses significant challenges for interpretability. This study addresses these challenges by introducing methods to enhance the understanding of neural networks, focusing specifically on models with a single hidden layer. We establish a theoretical framework by demonstrating that the neural network estimator can be interpreted as a nonparametric regression model. Building on this foundation, we propose statistical tests to assess the significance of input neurons and introduce algorithms for dimensionality reduction, including clustering and (PCA), to simplify the network and improve its interpretability and accuracy. The key contributions of this study include the development of a bootstrapping technique for evaluating artificial neural network (ANN) performance, applying statistical tests and logistic regression to analyze hidden neurons, and assessing neuron efficiency. We also investigate the behavior of individual hidden neurons in relation to out-put neurons and apply these methodologies to the IDC and Iris datasets to validate their practical utility. This research advances the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence by presenting robust statistical frameworks for interpreting neural networks, thereby facilitating a clearer understanding of the relationships between inputs, outputs, and individual network components.</description>

      <title>Learning Representation for Multitask learning through Self Supervised Auxiliary learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task learning is a popular machine learning approach that enables simultaneous learning of multiple related tasks, improving algorithmic efficiency and effectiveness. In the hard parameter sharing approach, an encoder shared through multiple tasks generates data representations passed to task-specific predictors. Therefore, it is crucial to have a shared encoder that provides decent representations for every and each task. However, despite recent advances in multi-task learning, the question of how to improve the quality of representations generated by the shared encoder remains open. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach called Dummy Gradient norm Regularization that aims to improve the universality of the representations generated by the shared encoder. Specifically, the method decreases the norm of the gradient of the loss function with repect to dummy task-specific predictors to improve the universality of the shared encoder's representations. Through experiments on multiple multi-task learning benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that DGR effectively improves the quality of the shared representations, leading to better multi-task prediction performances. Applied to various classifiers, the shared representations generated by DGR also show superior performance compared to existing multi-task learning methods. Moreover, our approach takes advantage of computational efficiency due to its simplicity. The simplicity also allows us to seamlessly integrate DGR with the existing multi-task learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction and the gradient flow of relative entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimension reduction, widely used in science, maps high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space. We investigate a basic mathematical model underlying the techniques of stochastic neighborhood embedding (SNE) and its popular variant t-SNE. Distances between points in high dimensions are used to define a probability distribution on pairs of points, measuring how similar the points are. The aim is to map these points to low dimensions in an optimal way so that similar points are closer together. This is carried out by minimizing the relative entropy between two probability distributions.
  We consider the gradient flow of the relative entropy and analyze its long-time behavior. This is a self-contained mathematical problem about the behavior of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We find optimal bounds for the diameter of the evolving sets as time tends to infinity. In particular, the diameter may blow up for the t-SNE version, but remains bounded for SNE.</description>

      <title>Automated Spatio-Temporal Weather Modeling for Load Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity is difficult to store, except at prohibitive cost, and therefore the balance between generation and load must be maintained at all times. Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together.  In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</description>

      <title>Exact gradients for linear optics with single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though parameter shift rules have drastically improved gradient estimation methods for several types of quantum circuits, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks, so far they have not been transferable to linear optics with single photons. In this work, we derive an analytical formula for the gradients in these circuits with respect to phaseshifters via a generalized parameter shift rule, where the number of parameter shifts depends linearly on the total number of photons. Experimentally, this enables access to derivatives in photonic systems without the need for finite difference approximations. Building on this, we propose two strategies through which one can reduce the number of shifts in the expression, and hence reduce the overall sample complexity. Numerically, we show that this generalized parameter-shift rule can converge to the minimum of a cost function with fewer parameter update steps than alternative techniques. We anticipate that this method will open up new avenues to solving optimization problems with photonic systems, as well as provide new techniques for the experimental characterization and control of linear optical systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Linear Dynamics from Bilinear Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a realization of a partially observed dynamical system with linear state transitions and bilinear observations. Under very mild assumptions on the process and measurement noises, we provide a finite time analysis for learning the unknown dynamics matrices (up to a similarity transform). Our analysis involves a regression problem with heavy-tailed and dependent data. Moreover, each row of our design matrix contains a Kronecker product of current input with a history of inputs, making it difficult to guarantee persistence of excitation. We overcome these challenges, first providing a data-dependent high probability error bound for arbitrary but fixed inputs. Then, we derive a data-independent error bound for inputs chosen according to a simple random design. Our main results provide an upper bound on the statistical error rates and sample complexity of learning the unknown dynamics matrices from a single finite trajectory of bilinear observations.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework for Analyzing Structural Transformation in Data-Constrained Economies Using Bayesian Modeling and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural transformation, the shift from agrarian economies to more diversified industrial and service-based systems, is a key driver of economic development. However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), data scarcity and unreliability hinder accurate assessments of this process. This paper presents a novel statistical framework designed to address these challenges by integrating Bayesian hierarchical modeling, machine learning-based data imputation, and factor analysis. The framework is specifically tailored for conditions of data sparsity and is capable of providing robust insights into sectoral productivity and employment shifts across diverse economies. By utilizing Bayesian models, uncertainties in data are effectively managed, while machine learning techniques impute missing data points, ensuring the integrity of the analysis. Factor analysis reduces the dimensionality of complex datasets, distilling them into core economic structures. The proposed framework has been validated through extensive simulations, demonstrating its ability to predict structural changes even when up to 60\% of data is missing. This approach offers policymakers and researchers a valuable tool for making informed decisions in environments where data quality is limited, contributing to the broader understanding of economic development in LMICs.</description>

      <title>Conditional Testing based on Localized Conformal p-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address conditional testing problems through the conformal inference framework. We define the localized conformal p-values by inverting prediction intervals and prove their theoretical properties. These defined p-values are then applied to several conditional testing problems to illustrate their practicality. Firstly, we propose a conditional outlier detection procedure to test for outliers in the conditional distribution with finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control. We also introduce a novel conditional label screening problem with the goal of screening multivariate response variables and propose a screening procedure to control the family-wise error rate (FWER). Finally, we consider the two-sample conditional distribution test and define a weighted U-statistic through the aggregation of localized p-values. Numerical simulations and real-data examples validate the superior performance of our proposed strategies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Extragradient-Type Methods -- Part 1: Generalizations and Sublinear Convergence Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the well-known extragradient (EG) method for solving both equations and inclusions. First, we unify and generalize EG for [non]linear equations to a wider class of algorithms, encompassing various existing schemes and potentially new variants. Next, we analyze both sublinear ``best-iterate'' and ``last-iterate'' convergence rates for the entire class of algorithms, and derive new convergence results for two well-known instances. Second, we extend our EG framework above to ``monotone'' inclusions, introducing a new class of algorithms and its corresponding convergence results. Third, we also unify and generalize Tseng's forward-backward-forward splitting (FBFS) method to a broader class of algorithms to solve [non]linear inclusions when a weak-Minty solution exists, and establish its ``best-iterate'' convergence rate. Fourth, to complete our picture, we also investigate sublinear rates of two other common variants of EG using our EG analysis framework developed here: the reflected forward-backward splitting and the golden ratio methods. Finally, we conduct an extensive numerical experiment to validate our theoretical findings. Our results demonstrate that several new variants of our proposed algorithms outperform existing schemes in the majority of examples.</description>

      <title>Parameter-efficient Bayesian Neural Networks for Uncertainty-aware Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art computer vision tasks, like monocular depth estimation (MDE), rely heavily on large, modern Transformer-based architectures. However, their application in safety-critical domains demands reliable predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. While Bayesian neural networks provide a conceptually simple approach to serve those requirements, they suffer from the high dimensionality of the parameter space. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, in particular low-rank adaptations (LoRA), have emerged as a popular strategy for adapting large-scale models to down-stream tasks by performing parameter inference on lower-dimensional subspaces. In this work, we investigate the suitability of PEFT methods for subspace Bayesian inference in large-scale Transformer-based vision models. We show that, indeed, combining BitFit, DiffFit, LoRA, and CoLoRA, a novel LoRA-inspired PEFT method, with Bayesian inference enables more robust and reliable predictive performance in MDE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the convergence of the stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm to a target measure in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distance. Crucially, compared to the existing literature on SGHMC, we allow its stochastic gradient to be discontinuous. This allows us to provide explicit upper bounds, which can be controlled to be arbitrarily small, for the expected excess risk of non-convex stochastic optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradients, including, among others, the training of neural networks with ReLU activation function. To illustrate the applicability of our main results, we consider numerical experiments on quantile estimation and on several optimization problems involving ReLU neural networks relevant in finance and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Optimal vintage factor analysis with deflation varimax</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vintage factor analysis is one important type of factor analysis that aims to first find a low-dimensional representation of the original data, and then to seek a rotation such that the rotated low-dimensional representation is scientifically meaningful. The most widely used vintage factor analysis is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by the varimax rotation. Despite its popularity, little theoretical guarantee can be provided to date mainly because varimax rotation requires to solve a non-convex optimization over the set of orthogonal matrices.
  In this paper, we propose a deflation varimax procedure that solves each row of an orthogonal matrix sequentially. In addition to its net computational gain and flexibility, we are able to fully establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed procedure in a broader context. Adopting this new deflation varimax as the second step after PCA, we further analyze this two step procedure under a general class of factor models. Our results show that it estimates the factor loading matrix in the minimax optimal rate when the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is moderate or large. In the low SNR regime, we offer possible improvement over using PCA and the deflation varimax when the additive noise under the factor model is structured. The modified procedure is shown to be minimax optimal in all SNR regimes. Our theory is valid for finite sample and allows the number of the latent factors to grow with the sample size as well as the ambient dimension to grow with, or even exceed, the sample size. Extensive simulation and real data analysis further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Projective Proximal Gradient Descent for A Class of Nonconvex Nonsmooth Optimization Problems: Fast Convergence Without Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems are important and challenging for statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we propose Projected Proximal Gradient Descent (PPGD) which solves a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, where the nonconvexity and nonsmoothness come from a nonsmooth regularization term which is nonconvex but piecewise convex. In contrast with existing convergence analysis of accelerated PGD methods for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems based on the Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz (K\L{}) property, we provide a new theoretical analysis showing local fast convergence of PPGD. It is proved that PPGD achieves a fast convergence rate of $\cO(1/k^2)$ when the iteration number $k \ge k_0$ for a finite $k_0$ on a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems under mild assumptions, which is locally Nesterov's optimal convergence rate of first-order methods on smooth and convex objective function with Lipschitz continuous gradient. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPGD.</description>

      <title>On Collaboration in Distributed Parameter Estimation with Resource Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective resource allocation in sensor networks, IoT systems, and distributed computing is essential for applications such as environmental monitoring, surveillance, and smart infrastructure. Sensors or agents must optimize their resource allocation to maximize the accuracy of parameter estimation. In this work, we consider a group of sensors or agents, each sampling from a different variable of a multivariate Gaussian distribution and having a different estimation objective. We formulate a sensor or agent's data collection and collaboration policy design problem as a Fisher information maximization (or Cramer-Rao bound minimization) problem. This formulation captures a novel trade-off in energy use, between locally collecting univariate samples and collaborating to produce multivariate samples. When knowledge of the correlation between variables is available, we analytically identify two cases: (1) where the optimal data collection policy entails investing resources to transfer information for collaborative sampling, and (2) where knowledge of the correlation between samples cannot enhance estimation efficiency. When knowledge of certain correlations is unavailable, but collaboration remains potentially beneficial, we propose novel approaches that apply multi-armed bandit algorithms to learn the optimal data collection and collaboration policy in our sequential distributed parameter estimation problem. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, DOUBLE-F, DOUBLE-Z, UCB-F, UCB-Z, through simulation.</description>

      <title>Source Attribution for Large Language Model-Generated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impressive performances of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their immense potential for commercialization have given rise to serious concerns over the Intellectual Property (IP) of their training data. In particular, the synthetic texts generated by LLMs may infringe the IP of the data being used to train the LLMs. To this end, it is imperative to be able to perform source attribution by identifying the data provider who contributed to the generation of a synthetic text by an LLM. In this paper, we show that this problem can be tackled by watermarking, i.e., by enabling an LLM to generate synthetic texts with embedded watermarks that contain information about their source(s). We identify the key properties of such watermarking frameworks (e.g., source attribution accuracy, robustness against adversaries), and propose a source attribution framework that satisfies these key properties due to our algorithmic designs. Our framework enables an LLM to learn an accurate mapping from the generated texts to data providers, which sets the foundation for effective source attribution. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our framework achieves effective source attribution.</description>

      <title>Non-Smooth Weakly-Convex Finite-sum Coupled Compositional Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03234v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates new families of compositional optimization problems, called $\underline{\bf n}$on-$\underline{\bf s}$mooth $\underline{\bf w}$eakly-$\underline{\bf c}$onvex $\underline{\bf f}$inite-sum $\underline{\bf c}$oupled $\underline{\bf c}$ompositional $\underline{\bf o}$ptimization (NSWC FCCO). There has been a growing interest in FCCO due to its wide-ranging applications in machine learning and AI, as well as its ability to address the shortcomings of stochastic algorithms based on empirical risk minimization. However, current research on FCCO presumes that both the inner and outer functions are smooth, limiting their potential to tackle a more diverse set of problems. Our research expands on this area by examining non-smooth weakly-convex FCCO, where the outer function is weakly convex and non-decreasing, and the inner function is weakly-convex. We analyze a single-loop algorithm and establish its complexity for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the Moreau envelop of the objective function. Additionally, we also extend the algorithm to solving novel non-smooth weakly-convex tri-level finite-sum coupled compositional optimization problems, which feature a nested arrangement of three functions. Lastly, we explore the applications of our algorithms in deep learning for two-way partial AUC maximization and multi-instance two-way partial AUC maximization, using empirical studies to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Non-backtracking Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated message-passing updates for graph neural networks allow representing large-scale graphs with local and computationally tractable updates. However, the updates suffer from backtracking, i.e., a message flowing through the same edge twice and revisiting the previously visited node. Since the number of message flows increases exponentially with the number of updates, the redundancy in local updates prevents the graph neural network from accurately recognizing a particular message flow relevant for downstream tasks. In this work, we propose to resolve such a redundancy issue via the non-backtracking graph neural network (NBA-GNN) that updates a message without incorporating the message from the previously visited node. We theoretically investigate how NBA-GNN alleviates the over-squashing of GNNs, and establish a connection between NBA-GNN and the impressive performance of non-backtracking updates for stochastic block model recovery. Furthermore, we empirically verify the effectiveness of our NBA-GNN on the long-range graph benchmark and transductive node classification problems.</description>

      <title>Realism in Action: Anomaly-Aware Diagnosis of Brain Tumors from Medical Images Using YOLOv8 and DeiT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of medical sciences, reliable detection and classification of brain tumors from images remains a formidable challenge due to the rarity of tumors within the population of patients. Therefore, the ability to detect tumors in anomaly scenarios is paramount for ensuring timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. This study addresses the issue by leveraging deep learning (DL) techniques to detect and classify brain tumors in challenging situations. The curated data set from the National Brain Mapping Lab (NBML) comprises 81 patients, including 30 Tumor cases and 51 Normal cases. The detection and classification pipelines are separated into two consecutive tasks. The detection phase involved comprehensive data analysis and pre-processing to modify the number of image samples and the number of patients of each class to anomaly distribution (9 Normal per 1 Tumor) to comply with real world scenarios. Next, in addition to common evaluation metrics for the testing, we employed a novel performance evaluation method called Patient to Patient (PTP), focusing on the realistic evaluation of the model. In the detection phase, we fine-tuned a YOLOv8n detection model to detect the tumor region. Subsequent testing and evaluation yielded competitive performance both in Common Evaluation Metrics and PTP metrics. Furthermore, using the Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) module, we distilled a Vision Transformer (ViT) model from a fine-tuned ResNet152 as a teacher in the classification phase. This approach demonstrates promising strides in reliable tumor detection and classification, offering potential advancements in tumor diagnosis for real-world medical imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Scoping Review of Earth Observation and Machine Learning for Causal Inference: Implications for the Geography of Poverty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data such as satellite imagery can have far-reaching impacts on our understanding of the geography of poverty, especially when coupled with machine learning (ML) and computer vision. Early research in computer vision used predictive models to estimate living conditions, especially in contexts where data availability on poverty was scarce. Recent work has progressed beyond using EO data to predict such outcomes -- now also using it to conduct causal inference. However, how such EO-ML models are used for causality remains incompletely mapped. To address this gap, we conduct a scoping review where we first document the growth of interest in using satellite images and other sources of EO data in causal analysis. We then trace the methodological relationship between spatial statistics and ML methods before discussing five ways in which EO data has been used in scientific workflows -- (1) outcome imputation for downstream causal analysis, (2) EO image deconfounding, (3) EO-based treatment effect heterogeneity, (4) EO-based transportability analysis, and (5) image-informed causal discovery. We consolidate these observations by providing a detailed workflow for how researchers can incorporate EO data in causal analysis going forward -- from data requirements to choice of computer vision model and evaluation metrics. While our discussion focuses on health and living conditions outcomes, our workflow applies to other measures of sustainable development where EO data are informative.</description>

      <title>Introducing CausalBench: A Flexible Benchmark Framework for Causal Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While witnessing the exceptional success of machine learning (ML) technologies in many applications, users are starting to notice a critical shortcoming of ML: correlation is a poor substitute for causation. The conventional way to discover causal relationships is to use randomized controlled experiments (RCT); in many situations, however, these are impractical or sometimes unethical. Causal learning from observational data offers a promising alternative. While being relatively recent, causal learning aims to go far beyond conventional machine learning, yet several major challenges remain. Unfortunately, advances are hampered due to the lack of unified benchmark datasets, algorithms, metrics, and evaluation service interfaces for causal learning. In this paper, we introduce {\em CausalBench}, a transparent, fair, and easy-to-use evaluation platform, aiming to (a) enable the advancement of research in causal learning by facilitating scientific collaboration in novel algorithms, datasets, and metrics and (b) promote scientific objectivity, reproducibility, fairness, and awareness of bias in causal learning research. CausalBench provides services for benchmarking data, algorithms, models, and metrics, impacting the needs of a broad of scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>
