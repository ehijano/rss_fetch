      <title>QED effects in quadratic Zeeman splitting in highly charged hydrogen-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ab initio calculations of one-electron quantum electrodynamical corrections to the second-order Zeeman splitting for the $1s_{1/2}$, $2s_{1/2}$, and $2p_{1/2}$ states in highly charged hydrogen-like ions. The self-energy correction is evaluated using the rigorous QED approach. The vacuum polarization correction is evaluated within the electric-loop approximation. Calculations are performed for the wide range of nuclear charge number: $Z = 14 - 92$.</description>

      <title>Collective Excitation of Quantum Droplet with Different Ranges of the Interaction of P\"oschl-Teller Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we studied quantum droplet with the P\"oschl-Teller (PT) interaction potential between the Bose atoms. The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation governs the system. The range and strength of the PT interaction can be adjusted. First, we studied the quantum droplet's density variation for various PT interaction parameters by the imaginary-time split-step Crank-Nicolson (CN) method. We then used the Bogoliubov theory to examine the collective excitation spectra. We observed that sharp roton forms and phonon modes are missing during long-range interactions. There is a gap at the zero momentum zone due to the long-range PT interaction, which increases with the range and strength of the interaction.</description>

      <title>Surface excitation of Rydberg dressed quantum droplet of Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have considered a quantum droplet of two components of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside the electron of a Rydberg atom to study the surface mode of collective excitation using the Bogoliubov theory of excitation. We have calculated the surface excitation spectrum for various Rydberg electron-atom interaction strengths. From the energy spectrum, we calculated the surface tension of the droplet as a function of Rydberg electron-atom interaction strength. Our study shows that the electron-atom interaction enhances the surface energy; hence, the droplet will be more stable inside the electron of a Rydberg atom.</description>

      <title>$g$ factor of the $2p_j$ excited states in lithium-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic calculations for the $g$ factor of the lowest excited states $2p_{1/2}$ and $2p_{3/2}$ of lithium-like ions over a wide range of the nuclear charge numbers $Z=10-92$ are presented. Interelectronic interaction is considered within the perturbation theory up to the second order. One-loop QED contributions are calculated to all orders in $\alpha Z$. Leading contributions of the nuclear recoil effects are taken into account. The quadratic and cubic terms in magnetic field are considered as well. A set of screening potentials is used in all calculations to estimate the unknown higher-order correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum-State-Controlled Collisions of Ultracold Polyatomic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions between ultracold calcium monohydroxide (CaOH) molecules are realized and studied. Inelastic collision rate constants are measured for CaOH prepared in ground and excited vibrational states, and the electric field dependence of these rates is measured for molecules in single quantum states of the parity-doubled bending mode. Theoretical calculations of collision rate coefficients are performed and found to agree with measured values. The lowest collisional loss rates are for states with repulsive long-range potentials that shield ultracold molecules from loss channels at short distance. These results unveil the collisional behavior of parity doublet molecules in the ultracold regime, and lay the foundation for future experiments to evaporatively cool polyatomic molecules to quantum degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Discrete time quasi-crystal in Rydberg atomic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time quasi-crystals are non-equilibrium quantum phenomena with quasi-periodic order in the time dimension, and are an extension of the discrete time-crystal phase. As a natural platform to explore the non-equilibrium phase of matter, the Rydberg atomic array has implemented the quantum simulation of the discrete-time crystal phase, associated with quantum many-body scar state. However, the existence of discrete time quasi-crystal on the Rydberg cold atom experiment platform has yet to be conceived. Here, we propose a method to generate the discrete time quasi-crystal behavior by coupling two discrete time-crystals, where associated two external driving frequencies have the maximum incommensurability. While we analysis its robustness and compute the phase diagram of corresponding observables. We significantly calculate the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system. Remarkably, we find the emergence of the aperiodic response is indeed caused by interaction between systems via Rydberg blockade effect. Our method thus offers the possibilities to explore the novel phases in quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Influence of optical aberrations on the accuracy of an atomic gravimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of the impact of laser beam wavefront aberrations in cold atom interferometers. We demonstrate that to reach accuracy at the mrad level, simulations cannot be based on a description of the retroreflection optics only with low-order Zernike polynomials, as the results will then depend on the decomposition order and the decomposition technique chosen. Moreover, simulations with high-order Zernike polynomials or equivalently high spatial frequency components require the propagation of aberrations to be taken into account, rather than adding them to the ideally propagated beam. Finally, we examine the impact of the parameters of the atomic source and show that the use of delta-kicked atomic cloud would efficiently mitigate the impact of this systematic effect.</description>

      <title>Using the Th III Ion for a Nuclear Clock and Searches for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 229Th nucleus possesses a unique low-frequency transition at 8.4 eV, which is being considered for the development of an extremely accurate nuclear clock. We investigate an electronic bridge process in the Th III ion, where nuclear excitation occurs via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper choice of laser frequencies can lead to 10,000 enhancement of this effect. Electrons also reduce 1.7 times the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.
  Additionally, the electronic structure of the Th III ion exhibits features that make it particularly useful for probing new physics. Notably, it contains a metastable state connected to the ground state via a weak M2 transition, which can be utilized for quantum information processing, as well as searches for oscillating axion field, violation of local Lorentz invariance, test of the Einstein's equivalence principle, and measurement of nuclear weak quadrupole moment. The electronic states of the ion present a unique case of level crossing involving the 5f, 6d, and 7s single-electron states. This crossing renders the transition frequencies highly sensitive to potential time-variation of the fine-structure constant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Two-Dimensional $\mathrm{U(1)}$ Gauge Theory in Rydberg and Rydberg-Dressed Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating $\mathrm{U(1)}$ quantum gauge theories with spatial dimension greater than one is of great physical significance yet has not been achieved experimentally. Here we propose a simple realization of $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge theory on triangular lattice Rydberg atom arrays. Within experimentally accessible range, we find that the effective model well simulates various aspects of the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge theory, such as emergence of topological sectors, incommensurability, and the deconfined Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Our proposal is easy to implement experimentally and exhibits pronounced quantum dynamics compared with previous proposals realizing $\mathrm{U(1)}$ and $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theories.</description>
