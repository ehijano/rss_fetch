      <title>Hypothesizing the Transmission of Smells: Six Methods of Chemical Travel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hypothesis regarding the travel and movement of chemicals between locations. We introduce six distinct methods to explain this process. The chemicals referred to in this article are those that we detect by the nose and can travel through the air. These are generally known as odorants or volatile compounds. Method 1 involves decomposing chemicals and transmitting their formulas digitally. Method 2 embeds chemicals in water, freezes it into ice, and transports it to the receiver, where the chemicals are extracted upon melting. Method 3 transfers chemicals via water logistics, with the receiver extracting them from the water. Method 4 uses airtight pipelines to transport chemicals in water, which are then extracted by the receiver. Method 5 projects chemical odors into the air, where the receiver captures them using suction. Method 6 draws from optical fiber technology to transmit chemical odors through a cable, ensuring the chemical composition remains intact. Each method ensures the receiver experiences the same scent as the sender.</description>
