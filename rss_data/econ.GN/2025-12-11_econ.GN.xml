      <title>Estimating the Impact of Case Management in MDLs: Lone Pine Orders and Bellwether Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Case management by judges is increasingly determining the outcome of litigation, particularly in the multidistrict litigation (MDL) process. One concern is that the MDL process pressures defendants to settle, regardless of the merits, and provides insufficient information on the value of individual cases within the MDL. Critics of the MDL system have suggested two management orders as solutions to these problems. The first is Lone Pine orders, which require plaintiffs in an MDL to produce evidence of injury and causation. The second is bellwether trials, in which the court selects certain cases for trial to provide information on the value of claims and encourage settlement. We examine the impact of Lone Pine orders and bellwether trial processes on the outcomes of cases in multidistrict litigation (MDLs). Using data on MDLs from 1992 to 2017, we find that Lone Pine orders are associated with an increase in the number of cases resolved in the MDL process.</description>

      <title>Measuring Corruption from Text Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Brazilian municipal audit reports, I construct an automated corruption index that combines a dictionary of audit irregularities with principal component analysis. The index validates strongly against independent human coders, explaining 71-73 \% of the variation in hand-coded corruption counts in samples where coders themselves exhibit high agreement, and the results are robust within these validation samples. The index behaves as theory predicts, correlating with municipal characteristics that prior research links to corruption. Supervised learning alternatives yield nearly identical municipal rankings ($R^{2}=0.98$), confirming that the dictionary approach captures the same underlying construct. The method scales to the full audit corpus and offers advantages over both manual coding and Large Language Models (LLMs) in transparency, cost, and long-run replicability.</description>

      <title>The Option Value of Contract Duration: Evidence from the U.S. Timber Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study quantifies how contract duration influences buyers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) when they hold real options that allow them to flexibly time consumption in response to changing market conditions. Using contract data from the US timber industry, we show that buyers delay consumption to manage payoff risk. This behavior generates heterogeneous WTP across buyers. We use structural estimation to uncover the key parameters underlying the incentive to delay consumption. Using these estimates, we conduct counterfactual simulations to measure how longer contract durations shift WTP and to clarify the boundary conditions linked to project size, buyer composition, and market trends. The counterfactual simulations reveal that extending contract duration from 3 to 4 years raises seller revenue by 9-13%, with effects amplified for larger projects and high-type buyers during the upward market trend.</description>

      <title>The Empirical Welfare Content of International Price and Income Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16654v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilateral index numbers are often used to make claims about welfare, such as treating PPPs as cross-country costs of living or real incomes as indicators of living standards. However, such interpretations may not be consistent with the observed data. To study this problem, I derive multilateral bounds on welfare implied by revealed preference and use these to appraise leading comparison methods. My findings support the welfare-interpretability of the contemporary indices I examine, but not of market exchange rates. When using a welfare-consistent multilateral index, the world in 2017 appears larger and more equal vis-\`a-vis the United States than conventional measures.</description>

      <title>Revealing economic facts: LLMs know more than they say</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the hidden states of large language models (LLMs) can be used to estimate and impute economic and financial statistics. Focusing on county-level (e.g. unemployment) and firm-level (e.g. total assets) variables, we show that a simple linear model trained on the hidden states of open-source LLMs outperforms the models' text outputs. This suggests that hidden states capture richer economic information than the responses of the LLMs reveal directly. A learning curve analysis indicates that only a few dozen labelled examples are sufficient for training. We also propose a transfer learning method that improves estimation accuracy without requiring any labelled data for the target variable. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of hidden-state representations in super-resolution and data imputation tasks.</description>

      <title>The Adoption and Usage of AI Agents: Early Evidence from Perplexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first large-scale field study of the adoption, usage intensity, and use cases of general-purpose AI agents operating in open-world web environments. Our analysis centers on Comet, an AI-powered browser developed by Perplexity, and its integrated agent, Comet Assistant. Drawing on hundreds of millions of anonymized user interactions, we address three fundamental questions: Who is using AI agents? How intensively are they using them? And what are they using them for? Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task. The two largest topics, Productivity &amp; Workflow and Learning &amp; Research, account for 57% of all agentic queries, while the two largest subtopics, Courses and Shopping for Goods, make up 22%. The top 10 out of 90 tasks represent 55% of queries. Personal use constitutes 55% of queries, while professional and educational contexts comprise 30% and 16%, respectively. In the short term, use cases exhibit strong stickiness, but over time users tend to shift toward more cognitively oriented topics. The diffusion of increasingly capable AI agents carries important implications for researchers, businesses, policymakers, and educators, inviting new lines of inquiry into this rapidly emerging class of AI capabilities.</description>
