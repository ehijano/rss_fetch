      <title>Nonexistence Results for a General Class of Parabolic Problems with a Potential on Weighted Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish nonexistence conditions for nonnegative nontrivial solutions to a class of semilinear parabolic equations with a positive potential on weighted graphs, extending results in arXiv:2404.12058 [math.AP] to a broader setting that includes both the Porous Medium Equation and the Fast Diffusion Equation. We identify conditions related to the graph's geometry, the potential's behaviour at infinity, and bounds on the Laplacian of the distance function under which nonexistence holds. Using a test function argument, we derive explicit parameter ranges for nonexistence.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for $a$-contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the theory of $a$-contraction with shifts with the intention of extending it to intermediate families. The theory of $a$-contraction with shifts is used to prove orbital $L^2$ stability to shock solutions of conservation laws. In this setting there are strong results for scalar laws and the extremal families of $n\times n$ systems of conservation laws. The only known results showing contraction of interior families are for the contact family the full Euler system and the case of rich systems due to Serre and Vasseur '16. This investigation culminates in finding necessary and sufficient conditions for which small shocks of general systems are local attractors with respect to the $a$-contraction theory.</description>

      <title>On the minimisation of the Peak-to-average ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \Subset \mathbb R^n$ and a continuous function $\mathrm H$ be given, where $n,k,N \in \mathbb N$. For $p\in [1,\infty]$, we consider the functional \[ \mathrm E_p(u) := \big\| \mathrm H \big(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u, \ldots, \mathrm D^ku \big) \big\|_{\mathrm L^p(\Omega)},\ \ \ u\in \mathrm W^{k,p}(\Omega;\mathbb R^N). \] We are interested in the $L^\infty$ variational problem \[ \mathrm C_{\infty,p}(u_\infty)\, =\, \inf \Big\{\mathrm C_{\infty,p}(u) \ : \ u\in \mathrm W^{k,\infty}_\varphi(\Omega;\mathbb R^N), \ \mathrm E_1(u)\neq 0 \Big\}, \] where $\varphi\in \mathrm W^{k,\infty}(\Omega;\mathbb R^N)$, $p$ is fixed, and \[ \mathrm C_{\infty,p}(u)\, := \, \frac{\mathrm E_\infty(u)}{\mathrm E_p(u)} . \] The variational problem is ill-posed. $\mathrm C_{\infty,2}$ is known as the ``Crest factor" and arises as the ``peak--to--average ratio" problem in various applications, including eg. nuclear reactors and signal processing in sound engineering. We solve it by characterising the set of minimisers as the set of strong solutions to the eigenvalue Dirichlet problem for the fully nonlinear PDE \[ \left\{ \ \ \begin{array}{ll} \big| \mathrm H \big(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u, \ldots, \mathrm D^ku \big) \big|= \Lambda, &amp; \text{ a.e.\ in }\Omega, \\ u = \varphi, &amp; \text{ on }\partial \Omega,\\ \mathrm D u = \mathrm D \varphi, &amp; \text{ on }\partial\Omega,
  \vdots &amp; \vdots \\ \mathrm D^{k-1}u = \mathrm D^{k-1}\varphi, &amp; \text{ on }\partial\Omega. \end{array} \right. \] Under appropriate assumptions for $\mathrm H$, we show existence of infinitely-many solutions $(u,\Lambda) \in \mathrm W^{k,\infty}_\varphi(\Omega;\mathbb R^N) \times [\Lambda_*,\infty)$ for $\Lambda_*\geq0$, by utilising the Baire Category method for implicit PDEs. In the case of $k=1$ and $n=N$, these assumptions do not require quasiconvexity.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic stability of composite wave of viscous shocks and viscous contact wave for Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear time-asymptotic stability of the composite wave consisting of two viscous shocks and a viscous contact discontinuity for the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations. Specifically, we establish that if the composite wave strength and the perturbations are sufficiently small, the NSF system admits a unique global-in-time strong solution, which converges uniformly in space as time tends to infinity, towards the corresponding composite wave, up to dynamical shifts in the positions of the two viscous shocks. Notably, the strengths of the two viscous shocks can be chosen independently. Our proof relies upon the $a$-contraction method with time-dependent shifts and suitable weight functions.</description>

      <title>The limiting case of the fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality in dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality (CKN) in one dimension when the parameter $\gamma$ converges (from the left) to its critical value $1/2$, obtaining Onofri's inequality in the unit disk as the limit. A difficulty that we encounter is the lack of an explicit expression for the extremal function at which the CKN inequality is attained, which we address by studying solutions of the weighted Liouville equation for the half-Laplacian in dimension one.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Solvability and Bubbling in 2D Stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation on a periodic 2D domain, driven by infinite-dimensional Gaussian noise in a Sobolev class. We establish strong local well-posedness in the energy space and characterize blow-up at random times in terms of energy concentration at small scales (bubbling). By iteration, we construct pathwise global weak solutions, with energy evolving as a c{\`a}dl{\`a}g process, and prove uniqueness within this class. These results offer a stochastic counterpart to the deterministic concept of Struwe solutions. The approach relies on a transformation that leads to a magnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with random gauge coefficients.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior of solutions to a cooperative model with population flux by attractive transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a diffusive Lotka-Volterra cooperative modelwith population flux by attractive transition. We study the time-global well-posedness and the large time behavior of solutions in a case where the habitat is a bounded convex domain and random diffusion rates equal to each other. A main result shows that when the spatial dimension is less than or equal to 3, under a weaker cooperative condition, a classical solution exists globally in time if the initial data belongs to a suitable functional space. Furthermore, it is shown that if there exists a positive steady state and the equal random diffusion rate is sufficiently large, then all positive solutions asymptotically approach the positive steady state as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness and characterisation of vector-valued absolute minimisers for a second order $L^\infty$-variational problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a vectorial $L^\infty$-variational problem of second order, where the supremal functional depends on the vector function $u$ through a linear elliptic operator in divergence form. We prove existence and uniqueness of the minimiser $u_\infty$ under prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditions, together with a characterisation of $u_\infty$ as solution of a specific system of PDEs. Our result can be seen as a twofold extension of the one in Katzourakis-Moser (ARMA 2019): we generalise it to the vectorial setting and, at the same time, we consider more general elliptic operators in place of the Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical limit of orthonormal Strichartz estimates on scattering manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quantum and classical correspondence related to the Strichartz estimates. First we consider the orthonormal Strichartz estimates on manifolds with ends. Under the nontrapping condition we prove the global-in-time estimates on manifolds with asymptotically conic ends or with asymptotically hyperbolic ends. Then we show that, for a class of pseudodifferential operators including the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the scattering manifolds, such estimates imply the global-in-time Strichartz estimates for the kinetic transport equations in the semiclassical limit. As a byproduct we prove that the existence of a periodic stable geodesic breaks the orthonormal Strichartz estimates. In the proof we do not need any quasimode. As an application we show the small data scattering for the cutoff Boltzmann equation on nontrapping scattering manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the nonlocal heat equation for certain L\'evy operators and the uniqueness of positive solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Widder-type theory for nonlocal heat equations involving quite general L\'evy operators. Thus, we consider nonnegative solutions and look for conditions on the operator that ensure: (i) uniqueness of nonnegative classical and very weak solutions with a given initial trace; (ii) the existence of an initial trace, belonging to certain admissibility class; and (iii) the existence of a solution, given by a representation formula, for any admissible initial trace. Such results are obtained first for purely nonlocal L\'evy operators defined through positive symmetric L\'evy kernels comparable to radial functions with mixed polynomial growth, and then extended to more general operators, including anisotropic ones and operators that have both a local and a nonlocal part.</description>

      <title>An abstract uncertainty principle with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under Wigdersons' framework and by sorting out the technical points in the recent work of Tang and Dias-Luef-Prata, we prove an abstract uncertainty principle for functions in the $L^p$ setting. An immediate consequence is a new uncertainty principle for the Fourier transform, unifying and extending many existing results. More applications are shown for PDEs, including the moment growth estimates for some linear and nonlinear dispersive equations, and a type of weighted lower bound estimate for the spacetime moment of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and heat equation inspired by the control theory.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Bochner-Riesz means on M\'etivier groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that bilinear Bochner-Riesz means $\mathcal{B}^{\alpha}$ associated with the sub-Laplacians on M\'etivier groups $G$, is bounded from $L^{p_1}(G) \times L^{p_2}(G) \to L^{p}(G)$ whenever $\alpha&gt;\alpha(p_1, p_2)$ and $(p_1, p_2, p)$ satisfies H\"older's relation, $1/p = 1/p_1 + 1/p_2$, $1\leq p_1, p_2 \leq \infty$ . Our result is an exact analogue of the corresponding result for $\mathbb{R}^n$, where the Euclidean dimension $n$ in the smoothness parameter $\alpha(p_1, p_2)$ is replaced by the topological dimension $d$ of the underlying M\'etivier groups $G$, rather than the homogeneous dimension $Q$, except at $(p_1, p_2, p)=(1,1,1/2)$ where there is loss of $1/2$ in the smoothness order.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions to the 3-D compressible MHD equations with density-dependent viscosities in exterior domains with far-field vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and uniqueness of local strong solutions to the three-dimensional compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with density-dependent viscosities in an exterior domain. The system models the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids, such as plasmas, and incorporates the effects of magnetic fields on fluid motion. We focus on the case where the viscosity coefficients are proportional to the fluid density, and the far-field density approaches vacuum. By introducing a reformulation of the problem using new variables to handle the degeneracy near vacuum, we establish the local well-posedness of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data, even in the presence of far-field vacuum. Our analysis employs energy estimates, elliptic regularity theory, and a careful treatment of the Navier-slip boundary conditions for the velocity and perfect conductivity conditions for the magnetic field. To the best of our knowledge, such results are not available even for the Cauchy problem to the 3-D compressible MHD equations with degenerate viscosities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the implicit Euler scheme to discretize the (random) Burgers-Huxley equation and prove the existence of a numerical attractor for the discrete Burgers-Huxley system. We establish upper semi-convergence of the numerical attractor to the global attractor as the step size tends to zero. We also provide finite-dimensional approximations for the three attractors (global, numerical and random) and prove the existence of truncated attractors as the state space dimension goes to infinity. Finally, we prove the existence of a random attractor and establish that the truncated random attractor upper semi-converges to the truncated global attractor as the noise intensity tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity for degenerate parabolic equations on a flat boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the optimal regularity of viscosity solutions to
  \begin{equation*}
  u_t - x_n^\gamma \Delta u = f,
  \end{equation*} which arises in the regularity theory for the porous medium equation. Specifically, we prove that under the zero Dirichlet boundary condition on $\{x_n=0\}$, the optimal regularity of $u$ up to the flat boundary $\{x_n=0\}$ is $C^{1,1-\gamma}$. Moreover, for the homogeneous equations, we establish that the optimal regularity of $u$ is $C^{2,1-\gamma}$ in the spatial variables, and that $x_n^{-\gamma}u$ is smooth in the variables $x'$ and $t$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an $L_{p}$ Christoffel-Minkowski-type problem that prescribes a class of $L_p$ geometric measures, which are mixtures of the $k$-th area measure and the $q$-th dual curvature measure. By establishing a gradient estimate, we obtain the existence of an even, smooth, strictly convex solution to this problem for $1 &lt; p &lt; q \leq k + 1$, where $1 \leq k \leq n$ and $n \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Sign-changing multi-peak standing waves of the NLSE with a point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following semilinear problem with a point interaction in $\mathbb{R}^N$: \[- \Delta_\alpha u + \omega u = u |u|^{p - 2},\] where $N \in \{2, 3\}$; $\omega &gt; 0$; $- \Delta_\alpha$ denotes the Hamiltonian of point interaction with inverse $s$-wave scattering length $- (4 \pi \alpha)^{- 1}$ and we want to solve for $u \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$. By means of Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction, we prove that this problem has sign-changing multi-peak solutions when either (1) $N = 2$, $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, $p_* &lt; p \leq 3$ and $\omega$ is sufficiently large or (2) $N = 3$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$, $p_* &lt; p &lt; 3$ and $\omega$ is sufficiently small, where $2.45 &lt; p_* := \frac{9 + \sqrt{113}}{8} &lt; 2.46$.</description>

      <title>Laplacian eigenvalues for large negative Robin parameters on domains with outward peaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of individual eigenvalues of the Laplacian in domains with outward peaks for large negative Robin parameters. A large class of cross-sections is allowed, and the resulting asymptotic expansions reflect both the sharpness of the peak and the geometric shape of its cross-section. The results are an extension of previous works dealing with peaks whose cross-sections are balls.</description>

      <title>Neumann Problems for Elliptic and Parabolic Sum Hessian Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the Neumann boundary value problem for sum Hessian equations. We first derive a priori $C^2$ estimates for $(k-1)$-admissible solutions in almost convex and uniformly $(k-1)$-convex domains, and prove the existence of admissible solutions via the method of continuity. Furthermore, we obtain existence results for the classical Neumann problem in uniformly convex domains. Finally, we extend these results to the corresponding parabolic problems.</description>

      <title>Small-mass solutions in a two-dimensional logarithmic chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system with indirect nutrient consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the singular chemotaxis-fluid system with indirect nutrient consumption: $
  n_{t}+u\cdot\nabla n=\Delta n-\nabla\cdot(n S(x,n,v)\cdot \nabla v);\
  v_{t}+u\cdot\nabla v=\Delta v-vw;\
  w_{t}+u\cdot\nabla w=\Delta w-w+n;\
  u_t+(u\cdot\nabla) u=\Delta u-\nabla P+n\nabla\Phi;\ \nabla\cdot u=0\ $
  in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$
  under no-flux/Neumann/Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions, where $\Phi\in W^{2,\infty}(\Omega)$, and $S: \overline{\Omega}\times [0,\infty) \times (0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}$ is a suitably smooth function that satisfies $|S(x,n,v)|\leq S_0(v) /v $ for all $(x,n,v) \in \Omega\times (0,\infty)^2$ with some nondecreasing $S_0: (0,\infty)\rightarrow(0,\infty)$.
  For all reasonably regular initial data with a smallness assumption merely involving the quantity $\int_\Omega n_0$,
  it is shown that the problem possesses a globally bounded classical solution, which, inter alia, exponentially stabilizes
  toward the spatially homogeneous state $( \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{\Omega}n_0,0,\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{\Omega}n_0,0)$ with respect to the norm in $L^\infty(\Omega)$.
  This rigorously confirms that, at least in the two-dimensional setting, in comparison to the direct mechanism of nutrient consumption, an indirect mechanism can induce much more regularity of solutions to the chemotaxis--fluid system even with a singular tensor-valued sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Turing instability for nonlocal heterogeneous reaction-diffusion systems: A computer-assisted proof approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a computer-assisted proof for the Turing instability induced by heterogeneous nonlocality in reaction-diffusion systems. Due to the heterogeneity and nonlocality, the linear Fourier analysis gives rise to \textit{strongly coupled} infinite differential systems. By introducing suitable changes of basis as well as the Gershgorin disks theorem for infinite matrices, we first show that all $N$-th Gershgorin disks lie completely on the left half-plane for sufficiently large $N$. For the remaining finitely many disks, a computer-assisted proof shows that if the intensity $\delta$ of the nonlocal term is large enough, there is precisely one eigenvalue with positive real part, which proves the Turing instability. Moreover, by detailed study of this eigenvalue as a function of $\delta$, we obtain a sharp threshold $\delta^*$ which is the bifurcation point for Turing instability.</description>

      <title>Brezis-Nirenberg type problems associated with nonlinear superposition operators of mixed fractional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to study the Brezis-Nirenberg type problem driven by the nonlinear superposition of operators of the form $$A_{\mu, p}u:=\int_{[0,1]}(-\Delta)_{p}^{s} u\,\, d \mu(s),$$ where $\mu$ denotes the signed measure over $[0, 1]$.
  We consider nonlinear nonlocal equations associated with $A_{\mu, p}$, involving critical nonlinearity and lower-order perturbation. Using variational techniques, we establish existence results for the critical problem by employing weak lower semicontinuity arguments under general assumptions on the perturbation term. We discuss the multiplicity results when the perturbation term vanishes at the origin. Additionally, when the lower-order term is a pure power function, we examine the Brezis-Nirenberg-type problem using the mountain pass technique. Furthermore, we address the existence of solutions to subcritical problems associated with $A_{\mu, p}.$
  Our findings are novel, even in the case of the sum of two distinct fractional $p$-Laplacians or a combination of a fractional $p$-Laplacian with a classical $p$-Laplacian. More generally, our framework is sufficiently broad to accommodate finite sums of different fractional $p$-Laplacians as well as cases involving fractional Laplacians with ``wrong" signs.
  A key contribution of this study is the development of a unified approach that systematically addresses these problems by incorporating a broad class of operators and lower-order perturbation terms within a common theoretical framework. The results remain new even in the case of linear superposition of fractional operators of different orders.</description>

      <title>Viscous pressureless flows with free boundary in one space dimension: The constant viscosity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global well-posedness of the free boundary problem of the viscous pressureless and almost pressureless heat conductive flows in one space dimension. In both cases, arbitrarily large but smooth initial data is considered, and the evolving fluid domains remain bounded for all time. In the viscous pressureless case, we are able to identify the terminal flow domain in terms of the initial data. In the viscous almost pressureless case, we construct the flow as a perturbation of the viscous pressureless flow, and establish the first result for the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system in the current setting.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of the 2D narrow-capture problem for partially accessible targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use singular perturbation theory to solve the 2D narrow capture problem for a set of partially accessible targets $\calU_k$, $k=1,\ldots,N$, in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \R^2$. In contrast to previous models of narrow capture, we assume that when a searcher finds a target by attaching to the partially adsorbing surface $\partial \calU_k$ it does not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior. Instead, the searcher remains attached to the surface for a random waiting time $\tau$, after which it either gains access to the resources within ({\em surface absorption}) or detaches and continues its search process ({\em surface desorption)}. We also consider two distinct desorption scenarios -- either the particle continues its search from the point of desorption or rapidly returns to its initial search position. We formulate the narrow capture problem in terms of a set of renewal equations that relate the probability density and target flux densities for absorption to the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations, which effectively sew together successive rounds of adsorption and desorption prior to the final absorption event, provide a general probabilistic framework for incorporating non-Markovian models of desorption/absorption and different search scenarios following desorption. We solve the general renewal equations in two stages. First, we calculate the Laplace transformed target fluxes for irreversible adsorption by solving a Robbin boundary value problem (BVP) in the small-target limit using matched asymptotic analysis. We then use the inner solution of the BVP to solve the corresponding Laplace transformed renewal equations for non-Markovian desorption/absorption, which leads to explicit Neumann series expansions of the corresponding target fluxes.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation in the flow approach for singular SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the renormalisation of singular SPDEs in the flow approach recently developed by Duch using a bottom-up setting. We introduce a general ansatz based on decorated trees for the solution of the flow equation. The ansatz is renormalised in a recursive way, in the sense of the trees, via local extractions introduced for regularity structures. We derive the renormalised equation from this ansatz and show that the renormalisation scheme is identical to that appearing in the context of regularity structures, thus matching the BPHZ renormalisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of semilinear parabolic stochastic evolution equations, posed on a sequence of Banach spaces approximating a limiting space and driven by additive white noise projected onto the former spaces. Under appropriate uniformity and convergence conditions on the linear operators, nonlinear drifts and initial data, we establish convergence of the associated mild solution processes when lifted to a common state space. Our framework is applied to the case where the limiting problem is a stochastic partial differential equation whose linear part is a generalized Whittle-Mat\'ern operator on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$, discretized by a sequence of graphs constructed from a point cloud. In this setting, we obtain discrete-to-continuum convergence of solutions lifted to the spaces $L^q(\mathcal{M})$ for $q \in [2,\infty]$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish orbital stability results for \textit{cnoidal} periodic waves of the cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon and Schr\"odinger equations in the energy space restricted to zero mean periodic functions. More precisely, for one hand, we prove that the cnoidal waves of the cubic Klein-Gordon equation are orbitally unstable as a direct application of the theory developed by Grillakis, Shatah, and Strauss. On the other hand, we show that the cnoidal waves for the Schr\"odinger equation are orbitally stable by constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional restricted to the associated zero mean energy space. The spectral analysis of the corresponding linearized operators, restricted to the periodic Sobolev space consisting of zero mean periodic functions, is performed using the Floquet theory and a Morse Index Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work relates quantitatively homogenization to Anderson localization for acoustic operators in disordered media. By blending dispersive estimates for homogenized operators and quantitative homogenization of the wave equation, we derive large-scale dispersive estimates for waves in disordered media that we apply to the spreading of low-energy eigenstates. This gives a short and direct proof that the lower spectrum of the acoustic operator is purely absolutely continuous in case of periodic media, and it further provides new lower bounds on the localization length of possible eigenstates in case of quasiperiodic or random media.</description>

      <title>Expanding solutions near unstable Lane-Emden stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the compressible Euler-Poisson equations for polytropes $P(\rho)=K\rho^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma\in \left(\frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3} \right]$ and the white dwarf stars. For $\gamma=\frac{4}{3},$ we establish the existence of a global weak solution for the spherically symmetric initial data with mass less than the mass of the Lane-Emden stars (i.e. non-rotating polytropes). For $\gamma\in \left(\frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3} \right)$, we show the existence of global weak solution for spherical symmetric initial data in an invariant set containing a neighborhood of Lane-Emden stars. Moreover, the support of these solution expands to infinity. As a corollary, this proves the strong instability of the Lane-Emden stars for $\gamma\in \left( \frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3}\right] $. For $\gamma\in \left(\frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3} \right),$ our results provide the first example of expanding solutions near the Lane-Emden stars. For white dwarf stars, we prove that the solution cannot collapse if the mass of initial data is less than the Chandrasekhar limit mass, which is the supremum of the mass of the non-rotating white dwarf stars. Our proof strongly uses the variational characterization of the Lane-Emden stars. First, we relate the best constant of a Hardy-Littlewood type inequality with the mass of the Lane-Emden stars with $\gamma=\frac{4}{3}$, which is further shown to equal the Chandrasekhar limit mass. For $\gamma\in\left( \frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3}\right) $, we show that the Lane-Emden stars are minimizers of an energy-mass functional subject to a Pohozaev type constraint. This is crucial in the construction of the invariant set of expanding solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present note is devoted to the studies of the relation of the time-zero limits of Kaden's spirals and the 2D Euler equation. It is shown that the time-zero limits of Kaden's spirals satisfy inhomogeneous 2D Euler in a weak sense. As a corollary, the necessity of both, the decay of spherical averages around the origin of the spiral as well as the velocity matching condition, for the 2D Euler equation to hold in a weak sense, is shown. Finally, some preliminary results concerning the Kaden spirals are obtained.</description>

Abstract: We establish local regularity results for minimizers of autonomous vectorial integrals of Calculus of Variations, assuming $\psi$-growth conditions and imposing $\varphi$-quasiconvexity only in an asymptotic sense, both in the sub-quadratic and super-quadratic case. In particular, we obtain $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity at points $x_0$ where $Du$ is sufficiently large in a neighborhood of $x_0$, as well as Lipschitz regularity on a dense set. \ The results hold for all pairs of Young functions $(\varphi, \psi)$ satisfying the $\Delta_2$ condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new class of $L^2$-weighted elliptic estimates on smooth two-manifolds for a family of weights satisfying an equation with explicit constants. This family includes weights that are comparable to the product of positive powers of the geodesic distance to a given collection of points. Our primary motivation is to derive estimates related to a weighted Hodge decomposition for one-forms.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Estimates in Passive Scalar Transport: A Unified Approach in $W^{1,p}$ via Christ-Journ\'e Commutator Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes new applications of the Christ-Journ\'e singular integral estimate to the transport equation for divergence-free vector fields in the Sobolev class $W^{1,p}$ with $p&gt;1$. Our main result is a stability estimate for the Cauchy problem, which quantifies the continuous dependence of solutions on initial data in the weak topology by giving bounds on the transfer of mass from high frequencies to low frequencies. Among other applications to stability and vanishing diffusion, this implies a mixing bound valid for all initial data in the DiPerna-Lions well-posedness class, with the mixing rate expressed in terms of a dimensionless ratio of the passive scalar and vector field. We also demonstrate that the passive scalar propagates a full "logarithm of a derivative" and finally discuss connections between the commutator estimates developed in this paper and uniform decay rates for the standard DiPerna-Lions commutator.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the critical points of solutions to two kinds of semilinear elliptic equations in higher dimensional domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to the {\it conjecture A} for bounded simple rotationally symmetric domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n(n\geq 3)$ along $x_n$ axis. Precisely, we use a new simple argument to study the symmetry of positive stable solutions for two kinds of semilinear elliptic equations. To do this, when $f(\cdot,s)$ is convex with respect to $s$, we show that the positivity of the first eigenvalue of the corresponding linearized operator in somehow symmetric domains is a sufficient condition for the symmetry of $u$. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness of critical points of a positive stable solution to semilinear elliptic equation $-\triangle u=f(\cdot,u)$ with zero Dirichlet boundary condition for simple rotationally symmetric domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by continuity method and a variety of maximum principles.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet problems associated to abstract nonlocal space-time differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let the abstract fractional space-time operator $(\partial_t + A)^s$ be given, where $s \in (0,\infty)$ and $-A \colon \mathsf{D}(A) \subseteq X \to X$ is a linear operator generating a uniformly bounded strongly measurable semigroup $(S(t))_{t\ge0}$ on a complex Banach space $X$. We consider the corresponding Dirichlet problem of finding a function $u \colon \mathbb{R} \to X$ such that $(\partial_t + A)^s u(t) = 0$ on $(t_0, \infty)$ and $u(t) = g(t)$ on $(-\infty, t_0]$, for given $t_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $g \colon (-\infty,t_0] \to X$. We define the concept of $L^p$-solutions, to which we associate a mild solution formula which expresses $u$ in terms of $g$ and $(S(t))_{t\ge0}$ and generalizes the well-known variation of constants formula for the mild solution to the abstract Cauchy problem $u' + Au = 0$ on $(t_0, \infty)$ with $u(t_0) = x \in \overline{\mathsf{D}(A)}$. Moreover, we include a comparison to analogous solution concepts arising from Riemann-Liouville and Caputo type initial value problems.</description>

      <title>Dispersive estimates for Dirac equations in Aharonov-Bohm magnetic fields: massless case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dispersive properties of a two dimensional massless Dirac equation perturbed by an Aharonov--Bohm magnetic field. Our main results will be a family of pointwise decay estimates and a full range family Strichartz estimates for the flow. The proof relies on the use of a relativistic Hankel transform, which allows for an explicit representation of the propagator in terms of the generalized eigenfunctions of the operator. These results represent the natural continuation of earlier research on evolution equations associated to operators with magnetic fields with strong singularities (see \cite{DF, FFFP, FZZ} where the Schr\"odinger and the wave equations were studied). Indeed, we recall the fact that the Aharonov--Bohm field represents a perturbation which is critical with respect to the scaling: this fact, as it is well known, makes the analysis particularly challenging.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic blow-up behavior for the semilinear heat equation with non scale invariant nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the asymptotic behavior near blowup points for positive solutions of the semilinear heat equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u-\Delta u =f(u), \end{equation*} for nonlinearities which are genuinely non scale invariant, unlike in the standard case $f(u)=u^p$. Indeed, our results apply to a large class of nonlinearities of the form $f(u)=u^pL(u)$, where $p&gt;1$ is Sobolev subcritical and $L$ is a slowly varying function at infinity (which includes for instance logarithms and their powers and iterates, as well as some strongly oscillating functions). More precisely, denoting by $\psi$ the unique positive solution of the corresponding ODE $y'(t)=f(y(t))$ which blows up at the same time $T$, we show that if $a\in\Omega$ is a blowup point of $u$, then \begin{equation*} \lim_{t\to T}\frac{u(a+y\sqrt{T-t},t)}{\psi(t)}= 1,\quad \text{uniformly for $y$ bounded.} \end{equation*} Additional blow-up properties are obtained, including the compactness of the blow-up set for the Cauchy problem with decaying initial data.</description>

      <title>Structural identifiability of linear-in-parameter parabolic PDEs through auxiliary elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter identifiability is often requisite to the effective application of mathematical models in the interpretation of biological data, however theory applicable to the study of partial differential equations remains limited. We present a new approach to structural identifiability analysis of fully observed parabolic equations that are linear in their parameters. Our approach frames identifiability as an existence and uniqueness problem in a closely related elliptic equation and draws, for homogeneous equations, on the well-known Fredholm alternative to establish unconditional identifiability, and cases where specific choices of initial and boundary conditions lead to non-identifiability. While in some sense pathological, we demonstrate that this loss of structural identifiability has ramifications for practical identifiability; important particularly for spatial problems, where the initial condition is often limited by experimental constraints. For cases with nonlinear reaction terms, uniqueness of solutions to the auxiliary elliptic equation corresponds to identifiability, often leading to unconditional global identifiability under mild assumptions. We present analysis for a suite of simple scalar models with various boundary conditions that include linear (exponential) and nonlinear (logistic) source terms, and a special case of a two-species cell motility model. We conclude by discussing how this new perspective enables well-developed analysis tools to advance the developing theory underlying structural identifiability of partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for H\"older continuity at a boundary point for quasiminima of double-phase functionals of $p,q$-Laplace type, in the setting of metric measure spaces equipped with a doubling measure and supporting a Poincar\'e inequality. We use a variational approach based on De Giorgi-type conditions to give a pointwise estimate near a boundary point. The proofs are based on a careful phase analysis and estimates in the intrinsic geometries.</description>

Abstract: These notes review the theory of Fisher information, especially its use in kinetic theory of gases and plasmas. The recent monotonicity theorem by Guillen--Silvestre for the Landau--Coulomb equation is put in perspective and generalised. Following my joint work with Imbert and Silvestre, it is proven that Fisher information is decaying along the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation, for all relevant interactions, and from this the once longstanding problem of regularity estimates for very singular collision kernels (very soft potentials) is solved.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the following Kirchhoff-type biharmonic equation \begin{equation}\label{pr} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \Delta^2 u+ \left(a+b\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|\nabla u|^2d x\right)(-\Delta u+V(x)u)=f(x,u),\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^N,\\ u\in H^{2}(\mathbb{R}^N), \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $a&gt;0$, $b\geq 0$ and $V(x)$ and $f(x, u)$ are periodic or asymptotically periodic in $x$. We study the existence of Nehari-type ground state solutions of the problem just above with $f(x,u)u-4F(x,u)$ sign-changing, where $F(x,u):=\int_0^uf(x,s)d s$. We significantly extend some results from the previous literature.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the existence of multiple sign-changing solutions of prescribed mass for a mass-supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation set on a compact metric graph. In particular, we obtain, in the supercritical mass regime, the first multiplicity result for prescribed mass solutions on compact metric graphs. As a byproduct, we prove that any eigenvalue of the associated linear operator is a bifurcation point. Our approach relies on the introduction a new kind of link and on the use of gradient flow techniques on a constraint. It can be transposed to other problems posed on a bounded domain.</description>

      <title>Transonic Shocks for 2-D Steady Euler Flows with Large Gravity in a Nozzle for Polytropic Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the existence of transonic shock solutions for two-dimensional (2-d) steady Euler flows of polytropic gases with the vertical gravity in a horizontal nozzle under a pressure condition imposed at the exit of the nozzle. The acceleration of the gravity g is assumed to take a generic value. We first show that the existence of special transonic shock solutions with the flow states depending only on the variable in the gravity direction can be established if and only if the Mach number of the incoming flow satisfies certain conditions. However, the shock position of the special solutions is arbitrary in the nozzle. We determine the shock position and establish the existence of transonic shock solution when the boundary data are small perturbations of the special shock solutions under certain conditions. Mathematically, the perturbation problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem of a nonlinear system of hyperbolic-elliptic mixed type and composite. Key difficulties in the analysis mainly comes from the vertical gravity. Methods and techniques are developed in this paper to deal with these key difficulties. Finally, it turns out that the vertical gravity plays a dominant role in the mechanism determining the shock position.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation linearized around the Ginzburg-Landau vortex of degree one under equivariant symmetry. Among the main results of this work, we determine the spectrum of the linearized operator, uncover a remarkable $L^2$-norm growth phenomenon related to a zero-energy resonance, and provide a complete construction of the distorted Fourier transform at small energies. The latter hinges upon a meticulous analysis of the behavior of the resolvent in the upper and lower half-planes in a small disk around zero-energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 3$, $0&lt;m&lt;\frac{n-2}{n}$, $\gamma&gt;0$ and $\eta&gt;0$. Suppose either (i) $\alpha\ne 0$ and $\beta=0$ or (ii) $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\beta\ne 0$ holds. We will study the elliptic equation $\Delta (f^m/m)+\alpha f+\beta x\cdot\nabla f=0$, $f&gt;0$, in $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$ with $\underset{\substack{r\to 0}}{\lim}\,r^{\gamma}f(r)=\eta$. This equation arises from the study of the singular self-similar solutions of the fast diffusion equation which blow up at the origin. We will prove that if there exists a radially symmetric singular solution of the above elliptic equation, then either $\gamma=\frac{2}{1-m}$ and $\alpha&gt;\frac{2\beta}{1-m}$ or $\gamma&gt;\frac{2}{1-m}$, $\beta\ne 0$ and $\gamma=\alpha/\beta$. As a consequence we obtain the non-existence of radially symmetric self-similar solution of the fast diffusion equation $u_t=\Delta (u^m/m)$, $u&gt;0$, which blows up at the origin with rate $|x|^{-\gamma}$ when either $0&lt;\gamma\ne\frac{2}{1-m}$ and $\gamma\ne\alpha/\beta$, $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\beta\ne 0$ or $\gamma=\frac{2}{1-m}$ and $\left(\alpha-\frac{2\beta}{1-m}\right)\eta\ne\frac{2(n-2-nm)}{(1-m)^2}$ holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $f\colon [0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ is of class $C^2$ then Sard's theorem implies that $f$ has the following relaxed Sard property: the image under $f$ of the Lebesgue measure restricted to the critical set of $f$ is a singular measure. We show that for $C^{1,\alpha}$ functions with $\alpha&lt;1$ this property is strictly stronger than the weak Sard property introduced by Alberti, Bianchini and Crippa, while for any monotone continuous function these two properties are equivalent.
  We also show that even in the one-dimensional setting H\"older regularity is not sufficient for the relaxed Sard property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish two stability theorems for steady or traveling solutions of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equation in a finite periodic channel, extending Arnold's classical work from the 1960s. Compared to Arnold's approach, we employ a compactness argument rather than relying on the negative definiteness of the energy-Casimir functional. The isovortical property of the Euler equation and Burton's rearrangement theory play an essential role in our analysis. As a corollary, we prove for the first time the existence of a class of stable non-shear flows when the ratio of the channel's height to its length is less than or equal to $\sqrt{3}/2.$ Two rigidity results are also obtained as byproducts.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions for time-dependent Signorini problems in linearised viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of solutions for time-dependent linearly viscoelastic bodies confined to a specified half-space. The confinement condition under consideration is of Signorini type, and is given over the boundary of the linearly viscoelastic body under consideration. In order to derive a suitable notion of solution that possesses a sufficient degree of regularity, we introduce the concept of ``admissible'' applied body force. In agreement with expectations, the variational problem that solutions must satisfy is a system of hyperbolic variational inequalities, and the displacement acceleration is a vector-valued measure in the sense of Dinculeanu.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence Rate of Sinkhorn's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Sinkhorn's algorithm for solving the entropically regularized optimal transport problem. Its iterate $\pi_{t}$ is shown to satisfy $H(\pi_{t}|\pi_{*})+H(\pi_{*}|\pi_{t})=O(t^{-1})$ where $H$ denotes relative entropy and $\pi_{*}$ the optimal coupling. This holds for a large class of cost functions and marginals, including quadratic cost with subgaussian marginals. We also obtain the rate $O(t^{-1})$ for the dual suboptimality and $O(t^{-2})$ for the marginal entropies. More precisely, we derive non-asymptotic bounds, and in contrast to previous results on linear convergence that are limited to bounded costs, our estimates do not deteriorate exponentially with the regularization parameter. We also obtain a stability result for $\pi_{*}$ as a function of the marginals, quantified in relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Convergent Numerical Method for Abstract Cauchy Problem with Fractional Derivative of Caputo Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13099v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exponentially convergent numerical method to approximate the solution of the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous fractional differential equation with an unbounded operator coefficient and Caputo fractional derivative in time. The numerical method is based on the newly obtained solution formula that consolidates the mild solution representations of sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and non-zero initial data. The involved integral operators are approximated using the sinc-quadrature formulas that are tailored to the spectral parameters of $A$, fractional order $\alpha$ and the smoothness of the first initial condition, as well as to the properties of the equation's right-hand side $f(t)$. The resulting method possesses exponential convergence for positive sectorial $A$, any finite $t$, including $t = 0$ and the whole range $\alpha \in (0,2)$. It is suitable for a practically important case, when no knowledge of $f(t)$ is available outside the considered interval $t \in [0, T]$. The algorithm of the method is capable of multi-level parallelism. We provide numerical examples that confirm the theoretical error estimates.</description>

      <title>Weak equals strong L2 regularity for partial tangential traces on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the boundary trace operators that naturally correspond to $\mathrm{H}(\operatorname{curl},\Omega)$, namely the tangential and twisted tangential trace, where $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}$. In particular we regard partial tangential traces, i.e., we look only on a subset $\Gamma$ of the boundary $\partial\Omega$. We assume both $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$ to be strongly Lipschitz (possibly unbounded). We define the space of all $\mathrm{H}(\operatorname{curl},\Omega)$ fields that possess a $\mathrm{L}^{2}$ tangential trace in a weak sense and show that the set of all smooth fields is dense in that space, which is a generalization of Belgacem, Bernardi, Costabel and Dauge 1997. This is especially important for Maxwell's equation with mixed boundary condition as we answer the open problem by Weiss and Staffans 2013 (Section 5) for strongly Lipschitz pairs.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation and Adaptive Solution of the Leray-Burgers Equation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to estimate the practical range of the characteristic wavelength parameter(referred to as the smoothing parameter) $\alpha$ in the Leray-Burgers equation. The Leray-Burgers equation, a regularization of the inviscid Burgers equation, incorporates a Helmholtz filter with a characteristic wavelength $\alpha$ to replace the usual convective velocity, inducing a regularized convective velocity. The filter bends the equation's characteristics slightly and makes them not intersect each other, leading to a global solution in time. By conducting computational experiments with various initial conditions, we determine the practical range of $\alpha &gt;0$ that closely approximates the solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation. Our findings indicate that the value of $\alpha$ depends on the initial data, with the practical range of $\alpha$ being between 0.01 and 0.05 for continuous initial profiles and between 0.01 and 0.03 for discontinuous initial profiles. The Leray-Burgers equation captures shock and rarefaction waves within the temporal domain for which training data exists. However, as the temporal domain extends beyond the training interval, data-driven forward computation demonstrates that the predictions generated by the PINN start to deviate from the exact solutions. This study also highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of the Leray-Burgers equation in real practical problems, specifically Traffic State Estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give improved estimates for the size of the singular set of minimizing capillary hypersurfaces: the singular set is always of codimension at least $4$, and this estimate improves if the capillary angle is close to $0$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, or $\pi$. For capillary angles that are close to $0$ or $\pi$, our analysis is based on a rigorous connection between the capillary problem and the one-phase Bernoulli problem.</description>

      <title>Construct accurate multi-continuum micromorphic homogenisations in multi-D space-time with computer algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogenisation empowers the efficient macroscale system level prediction of physical scenarios with intricate microscale structures. Here we develop an innovative powerful, rigorous and flexible framework for asymptotic homogenisation of dynamics at the \emph{finite} scale separation of real physics, with proven results underpinned by modern dynamical systems theory. The novel systematic approach removes most of the usual assumptions, whether implicit or explicit, of other methodologies. By no longer assuming averages the methodology constructs so-called multi-continuum or micromorphic homogenisations systematically informed by the microscale physics. The developed framework and approach enables a user to straightforwardly choose and create such homogenisations with clear physical and theoretical support, and of highly controllable accuracy and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Dense networks of integrate-and-fire neurons: Spatially-extended mean-field limit of the empirical measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of spatially-structured networks of $N$ interacting stochastic neurons can be described by deterministic population equations in the mean-field limit. While this is known, a general question has remained unanswered: does synaptic weight scaling suffice, by itself, to guarantee the convergence of network dynamics to a deterministic population equation, even when networks are not assumed to be homogeneous or spatially structured? In this work, we consider networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons with arbitrary synaptic weights satisfying a $O(1/N)$ scaling condition. Borrowing results from the theory of dense graph limits, or graphons, we prove that, as $N\to\infty$, and up to the extraction of a subsequence, the empirical measure of the neurons' membrane potentials converges to the solution of a spatially-extended mean-field partial differential equation (PDE). Our proof requires analytical techniques that go beyond standard propagation of chaos methods. In particular, we introduce a weak metric that depends on the dense graph limit kernel and we show how the weak convergence of the initial data can be obtained by propagating the regularity of the limit kernel along the dual-backward equation associated with the spatially-extended mean-field PDE. Overall, this result invites us to reinterpret spatially-extended population equations as universal mean-field limits of networks of neurons with $O(1/N)$ synaptic weight scaling.</description>

      <title>A Singular Integral for a Simplified Clairaut Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This expository article on the Lagrange singular integral contains two novelties. The first novelty involves a connection between the Lagrange singular integral for a simplified Clairaut equation, and Euler's homogeneous function theorem. The paper presents a formal derivation of Euler's solution from Lagrange's complete integral, though with some caveats, and also constructs more general surfaces from the complete integral which go beyond Euler's solutions. The first rather complicated construction is based directly on Goursat's definition of a general integral, while the subsequent simpler constructions are based on a suitably expanded notion of the general integral. This generalized general integral is our second novelty. It bridges some of the gap between the the general integral, and the complete integral, partially addressing Evans' remarks (Partial Differential Equations, AMS Graduate Studies in Mathematics, 1998) on the limitations of the general integral. Finally we discuss some subtleties around complete integrals as noted by Chojnacki (Proceedings of the AMS, 1995) and some around general integrals as noted by Evans, and how they apply to our examples. We aim to present these classical PDE concepts to readers with a basic knowledge of multivariable calculus.</description>

      <title>POD-Galerkin Reduced Order Modeling of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling (ROM) aims to mitigate computational complexity by reducing the size of a high-dimensional state space. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin ROM when applied to the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation model, which integrates coupled atmosphere, ocean, and sea surface temperature (SST) mechanisms in the equatorial Pacific. While POD identifies the most energetic modes of a system from simulation data, the Galerkin projection maps the governing equations onto these reduced modes to derive a simplified dynamical system. Leveraging the unique coupling properties of the model, we propose a novel approach to formulate a reduced order model derived from Galerkin projection. Our approach achieves remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only four POD modes. The results provide highly stable and accurate solutions over 95% compared to the high-dimensional full-order model (FOM), highlighting the potential of POD-Galerkin reduction for efficient and accurate climate simulations.</description>

      <title>Many facets of cohomology: Differential complexes and structure-aware formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>Subordination based approximation of Caputo fractional propagator and related numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an exponentially convergent numerical method for the Caputo fractional propagator $S_\alpha(t)$ and the associated mild solution of the Cauchy problem with time-independent sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2)$ in time. The proposed methods are constructed by generalizing the earlier developed approximation of $S_\alpha(t)$ with help of the subordination principle. Such technique permits us to eliminate the dependence of the main part of error estimate on $\alpha$, while preserving other computationally relevant properties of the original approximation: native support for multilevel parallelism, the ability to handle initial data with minimal spatial smoothness, and stable exponential convergence for all $t \in [0, T]$. Ultimately, the use of subordination leads to a significant improvement of the method's convergence behavior, particularly for small $\alpha &lt; 0.5$, and opens up further opportunities for efficient data reuse. To validate theoretical results, we consider applications of the developed methods to the direct problem of solution approximation, as well as to the inverse problem of fractional order identification.</description>
