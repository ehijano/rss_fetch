      <title>Low-Energy Boundary-State Emergence and Delocalization in Finite-sized Mosaic Wannier-Stark Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mosaic Wannier Stark lattice has gained increasing prominence as a disorder free system exhibiting unconventional localization behavior induced by spatially periodic Stark potentials. In the infinite size limit, exact spectral analysis reveals an almost pure point spectrum. There is no true mobility edge, except for (M 1) isolated extended states, which are accompanied by weakly localized modes with diverging localization lengths. Motivated by this spectral structure, we investigate the mosaic Wannier Stark model under finite-size. In such systems, additional low energy boundary localized states emerge due to boundary residuals when the system length is not commensurate with the modulation period. These states are effectively distinguished and identified using the inverse participation ratio (IPR) and spatial expectation values. To explore their response to non-Hermitian perturbations, complex on site potentials are introduced to simulate gain and loss. As the non-Hermitian strength increases, only the weakly localized states undergo progressive delocalization, exhibiting a smooth crossover from localization to spatial extension.</description>

      <title>Amortized Clustering Assistant Classification of Anomalous Hybrid Floquet Modes in a Periodically Driven non-Hermitian Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between Floquet periodically driving and non-Hermiticity could bring about intriguing novel phenomena with anomalous Floquet topological phases of a finite-size, tight-binding lattice model. How to efficiently investigate on quasi-energy and eigenfield of a non-Hermitian Floquet system with complicated driving protocol remains a challenging task. In this work, we define a somewhat complex driving protocol for a bipartite lattice system and discover two nontrivial topological phases that support Floquet {\pi} mode. Thereafter, we introduce unsupervised learning method in order to explore distribution features of system eigenfunctions under different magnitude of system energy gain/loss. We utilize the idea of amortized clustering and construct an algorithm selector that could dynamically upgrade with increasing gain/loss as input parameter. Proper employment of the selector enables us to reveal the regulation of dynamic localization from abundant possible wave function distribution in two-dimension lattice in another efficient way. In addition, our work provides a feasible methodology via machine learning method to assist in classification of Floquet modes.</description>

      <title>There is no ultrastrong coupling with photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical accounts of ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems commonly assume that it arises from the interaction of an emitter with propagating photon modes supported by a structure, understanding photons as the excitations of the transverse electromagnetic field. This description discards the Coulomb interaction between the emitter and structure charges. Here, we show with a general argument based on electromagnetic constraints that the emitter-photon coupling strength is fundamentally limited. Accordingly, we conclude that the ultrastrong coupling regime cannot be reached with photons. Instead, it must originate from the Coulomb interactions between charges. A further corollary is that the so-called polarization self-energy term does not need to be included. We illustrate our claims by solving an analytical model of the paradigmatic case of an emitter next to a metallic nanosphere. These findings shed light on the fundamental processes underlying ultrastrong coupling, clarify the role of the polarization self-energy term and compel a reevaluation of previous literature.</description>
