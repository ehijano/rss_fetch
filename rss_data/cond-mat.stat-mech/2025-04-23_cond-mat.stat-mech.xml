      <title>From observed transitions to hidden paths in Markov networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of observable degrees of freedom is typically limited in experiments. Here, we consider discrete Markov networks in which an observer has access to a few visible transitions and the waiting times between these transitions. Focusing on the underlying structure of a discrete network, we present methods to infer local and global properties of the network from observed data. First, we derive bounds on the microscopic entropy production along the hidden paths between two visible transitions, which complement extant bounds on mean entropy production and affinities of hidden cycles. Second, we demonstrate how the operationally accessible data encodes information about the topology of shortest hidden paths, which can be used to identify potential clusters of states or exclude their existence. Finally, we outline a systematic way to combine the inferred data, resulting in an algorithm that finds the candidates for a minimal graph of the underlying network, i.e., a graph that is part of the original one and compatible with the observations. Our results highlight the interplay between thermodynamic methods, waiting-time distributions and topological aspects like network structure, which can be expected to provide novel insights in other set-ups of coarse graining as well.</description>

      <title>Interacting Chern insulator transition on the sphere: revealing the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</description>

      <title>Canonical ensemble of a $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the canonical ensemble of a $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime in a cavity surrounded by a heat reservoir through the Euclidean path integral formalism. The heat reservoir is described by the boundary of the cavity with fixed radius $R$, fixed temperature $T$, and fixed electric charge $Q$. We use York's approach to find the reduced action, and then perform a zero loop approximation. We find that the number of solutions for the black hole depends on the electric charge being smaller or larger than a critical $Q_s$, having two stable and one unstable solutions for the former case, and one stable solution for the latter. We obtain the system's thermodynamic properties from the partition function. We analyze thermodynamic stability, controlled by the positivity of the heat capacity at constant area and electric charge. We show that there is a discontinuity in the heat capacity, signaling a turning point. We investigate the favorable stable phases and the phase diagram of the system. We show that the two stable black hole solutions can suffer a first order phase transition from one to the other, and at the critical charge $Q_s$ this turns into a second order one. We introduce a model of charged hot flat space, i.e., hot flat space with charge near the boundary. We find that a first order phase transition between the large stable black hole and charged hot flat space occurs at a horizon radius larger than the Buchdahl bound, and comment on the physics. Finally, we recover the Davies thermodynamic solutions and a Rindler solution in the limit of infinite cavity, and the York solutions in the limit of zero charge. Hence, both York and Davies formalisms are unified and connected in our approach. In all instances we mention carefully the four-dimensional case, for which we accomplish new results, and study in detail all aspects of the five-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>(Thermo-)dynamics of the spin-boson model in the weak coupling regime: Application as a quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-boson model's dynamical and thermodynamic features in the weak coupling regime using the weak coupling spin-boson (WCSB) and phase covariant (PC) master equations. Both unital (pure dephasing) and non-unital (dissipative) quantum channels are considered. On the dynamical side, we explore key quantum features including non-Markovianity, quantum speed limit, quantum coherence, and the system's steady-state behavior. Notably, the measures of non-Markovianity exhibit different behavior under WCSB and PC dynamics. From the quantum thermodynamic perspective, we conceptualize the spin-boson system as a quantum battery and analyze its performance through metrics such as energy, ergotropy, anti-ergotropy, and battery capacity. We further examine the roles of pure dephasing and dissipative processes in shaping the battery's performance. Our findings demonstrate the spin-boson model's versatility as a platform for efficient energy storage and transfer in quantum thermodynamic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to characterize the dynamics of perturbed many-body integrable systems. Focusing on the paradigmatic case of the Toda chain under non-integrable Hamiltonian perturbations, this study introduces a method based the time evolution of the Lax eigenvalues $\lambda_\alpha$ as a proxy of the quasi-particles velocities and of the perturbed Toda actions. A set of exact equations of motion for the $\lambda_\alpha$ is derived that closely resemble those for eigenenergies of a quantum problem (also known as the Pechukas-Yukawa gas). Numerical simulations suggest that the invariant measure of such dynamics is basically the thermal density of states of the Toda lattice, regardless of the form of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Microscopic fluctuations in the spreading fronts of circular wetting liquid droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerically the kinetic roughening properties of the precursor fronts of nonvolatile liquid droplets spreading on solid substrates, for the case of circular droplets, more frequently addressed in experiments. To this end, we perform kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations of a lattice gas model whose kinetic roughening behavior has been recently assessed in a band geometry [J.\ M.\ Marcos {\em et al.}, Phys.\ Rev.\ E {\bf 105}, 054801 (2022)]. We compare the scaling behaviors of the spreading fronts obtained for the two geometries, in view of the occurrence of, for example, different universality subclasses for different growth geometries for the related important Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. For circular droplets we obtain that the average front position increases (sub-)diffusively as $R\sim t^{\delta}$, where $\delta \lesssim 1/2$ shows a stronger dependence on the conditions considered for temperature and substrate wettability than in band geometry. In spite of this, front fluctuations for circular droplets behave qualitatively similar to those seen for band geometries, with kinetic roughening exponent values which similarly depend on temperature $T$ but become $T$-independent for sufficiently high $T$. Circular droplets also display intrinsic anomalous scaling with different values of the roughness exponent at short and large length scales, and fluctuations statistics which are close to the Tracy-Widom probability distribution function that applies in the corresponding KPZ universality subclass, now the one expected for interfaces with an overall circular symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle &gt; 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^a$, where $a = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $a$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Transition Rates in Generalized Kramers Problems for Non-Variational, Non-Normal System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kramers' escape problem serves as a paradigm for understanding transitions and various types of reactions, such as chemical and nuclear reactions, in systems driven by thermal fluctuations and damping, particularly within the realm of classical variational dynamics. Here, we generalize Kramers' problem to processes with non-normal dynamics characterized by asymmetry, hierarchy, and stochastic fluctuations, where transient amplification and stochastic perturbations play a critical role. The obtained generalized escape rates are structurally similar to those for variational systems, but with a renormalized temperature proportional to the square of the condition number $\kappa$ which measures non-normality. Because $\kappa$ can take large values (e.g., $10$ or more) in many systems, the resulting acceleration of transition rates can be enormous, given the exponential dependence on the inverse temperature in Kramers' formula. As an illustration, our framework offers a potential resolution to the long-standing question in epigenetics of how DNA methylation can proceed with such remarkable speed. By uncovering the role of strong non-normal dynamics, we derive a robust, universal expression for methylation timing that predicts fast, switch-like transitions, on the order of minutes, for a wide range of noise amplitudes and methylation levels, and in agreement with experimental observations. More broadly, our findings indicate that non-normal accelerated escape rates are likely to be a key mechanism underlying rapid transitions in diverse systems, from biological metabolism and ecosystem shifts to climate dynamics and socio-economic processes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gibbs ensembles in weakly interacting dissipative systems and digital quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying use cases with superconducting circuits not critically affected by the inherent noise is a pertinent challenge. Here, we propose using a digital quantum computer to showcase the activation of integrable effects in weakly dissipative integrable systems. Dissipation is realized by coupling the system's qubits to ancillary ones that are periodically reset. We compare the digital reset protocol to the usual Lindblad continuous-time evolution by considering non-interacting integrable systems dynamics, which can be analyzed using scattering between the Bogoliubov quasiparticles caused by the dissipation. If not dominant, the inherent noise would cause extra scattering but would not critically change the physics. A corresponding quantum computer implementation would illuminate the possibilities of stabilizing exotic states in nearly integrable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network architecture for efficient sampling of statistical physics models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of sampling efficiently the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution of disordered systems is important both for the theoretical understanding of these models and for the solution of practical optimization problems. Unfortunately, this task is known to be hard, especially for spin glasses at low temperatures. Recently, many attempts have been made to tackle the problem by mixing classical Monte Carlo schemes with newly devised Neural Networks that learn to propose smart moves. In this article we introduce the Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network (4N) architecture, a physically-interpretable deep architecture whose number of parameters scales linearly with the size of the system and that can be applied to a large variety of topologies. We show that the 4N architecture can accurately learn the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model, and specifically for some of its most difficult instances. In particular, it captures properties such as the energy, the correlation function and the overlap probability distribution. Finally, we show that the 4N performance increases with the number of layers, in a way that clearly connects to the correlation length of the system, thus providing a simple and interpretable criterion to choose the optimal depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for sampling tightly confined random equilateral closed polygons in three-space which has runtime linear in the number of edges. Using symplectic geometry, sampling such polygons reduces to sampling a moment polytope, and in our confinement model this polytope turns out to be very natural from a combinatorial point of view. This connection to combinatorics yields both our fast sampling algorithm and explicit formulas for the expected distances of vertices to the origin. We use our algorithm to investigate the expected total curvature of confined polygons, leading to a very precise conjecture for the asymptotics of total curvature.</description>
