      <title>Deep Signature and Neural RDE Methods for Path-Dependent Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep BSDE and 2BSDE solver that combines truncated log signatures with a neural rough differential equation backbone for high dimensional, path dependent valuation and control. The design aligns stochastic analysis with sequence to path learning, using a CVaR tilted objective to emphasize left tail risk and an optional second order head for risk sensitive control. Under equal compute and parameter budgets, the method improves accuracy, tail fidelity, and training stability across Asian and barrier option pricing and portfolio control tasks. At 200 dimensions, it achieves CVaR(0.99) = 9.8 percent compared to 12.0-13.1 percent for strong baselines, while attaining low HJB residuals and small RMSE for Z and Gamma. Ablations confirm complementary gains from the sequence to path representation and the second order structure. Overall, the results show that combining stochastic analysis with modern deep learning expands the class of solvable path dependent financial models at scale.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Price Formation on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the mean-field game theory with the classical idea of binomial tree framework, pioneered by Sharpe and Cox, Ross &amp; Rubinstein, to solve the equilibrium price formation problem for the stock. For agents with exponential utilities and recursive utilities of exponential type, we prove the existence of a unique mean-field equilibrium and derive an explicit formula for equilibrium transition probabilities of the stock price by restricting its trajectories onto a binomial tree. The agents are subject to stochastic terminal liabilities and incremental endowments, both of which are dependent on unhedgeable common and idiosyncratic factors, in addition to the stock price path. Finally, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the qualitative effects of these components on the equilibrium price distribution.</description>

      <title>Robust Exploratory Stopping under Ambiguity in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a continuous-time robust reinforcement learning framework for optimal stopping problems under ambiguity. In this framework, an agent chooses a stopping rule motivated by two objectives: robust decision-making under ambiguity and learning about the unknown environment. Here, ambiguity refers to considering multiple probability measures dominated by a reference measure, reflecting the agent's awareness that the reference measure representing her learned belief about the environment would be erroneous. Using the $g$-expectation framework, we reformulate an optimal stopping problem under ambiguity as an entropy-regularized optimal control problem under ambiguity, with Bernoulli distributed controls to incorporate exploration into the stopping rules. We then derive the optimal Bernoulli distributed control characterized by backward stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we establish a policy iteration theorem and implement it as a reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm across different levels of ambiguity and exploration.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Quantifying Financial Bubbles with the Hyped Log-Periodic Power Law Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model, the Hyped Log-Periodic Power Law Model (HLPPL), to the problem of quantifying and detecting financial bubbles, an ever-fascinating one for academics and practitioners alike. Bubble labels are generated using a Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, sentiment scores, and a hype index we introduced in previous research on NLP forecasting of stock return volatility. Using these tools, a dual-stream transformer model is trained with market data and machine learning methods, resulting in a time series of confidence scores as a Bubble Score. A distinctive feature of our framework is that it captures phases of extreme overpricing and underpricing within a unified structure.
  We achieve an average yield of 34.13 percentage annualized return when backtesting U.S. equities during the period 2018 to 2024, while the approach exhibits a remarkable generalization ability across industry sectors. Its conservative bias in predicting bubble periods minimizes false positives, a feature which is especially beneficial for market signaling and decision-making. Overall, this approach utilizes both theoretical and empirical advances for real-time positive and negative bubble identification and measurement with HLPPL signals.</description>

      <title>Nonconcave Robust Utility Maximization under Projective Determinacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a general robust utility maximization problem in a discrete-time frictionless market. The investor is assumed to have a possibly infinite, random, nonconcave, and nondecreasing utility function defined on the whole real line. She also faces model ambiguity on her beliefs about the market, which is modelled through a set of priors. We assume that the utility and the prices are projective functions of the path, while the graphs of the local priors are projective sets. Our other assumptions are stated on a prior-by-prior basis and correspond to generally accepted assumptions in the literature on markets without ambiguity. Under the set-theoretic axiom of Projective Determinacy (PD), our main result is the existence of an optimal investment strategy when the utility function is also upper-semicontinuous.
  We further provide several counterexamples justifying our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Occupied Processes: Going with the Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07936v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stochastic process $X$ becomes \textit{occupied} when it is enlarged with its occupation flow $\mathcal{O}$, which tracks the time spent by the path at each level. Crucially, the occupied process $(\mathcal{O},X)$ enjoys a Markov structure when $X$ is Markov. We develop a novel It\^o calculus for occupied processes that lies midway between Dupire's functional It\^o calculus and the classical version. We derive a surprisingly simple It\^o formula and, through Feynman-Kac, unveil a broad class of path-dependent PDEs where $\mathcal{O}$ plays the role of time. The space variable, given by the current value of $X$, remains finite-dimensional, thereby paving the way for standard elliptic PDE techniques and numerical methods. In the financial applications, we demonstrate that occupation flows provide unified Markovian lifts for exotic options and variance instruments, allowing financial institutions to price and manage derivatives books with a single numerical solver. We then explore avenues in financial modeling where volatility is driven by the occupied process. In particular, we propose the local occupied volatility (LOV) model which not only calibrates to European vanilla options but also offers the flexibility to capture stylized facts of volatility or fit other instruments. We also present an extension of forward variance models that leverages the entire forward occupation surface.</description>

      <title>Intraday Battery Dispatch for Hybrid Renewable Energy Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical model for intraday dispatch of co-located wind-battery energy assets. Focusing on the primary objective of firming grid-side actual production vis-a-vis the preset day-ahead hourly generation targets, we conduct a comprehensive study of the resulting stochastic control problem across different firming formulations and wind generation dynamics. Among others, we provide a closed-form solution in the special case of a quadratic objective and linear dynamics, as well as design a novel adaptation of a Gaussian Process-based Regression Monte Carlo algorithm for our setting. Extensions studied include an asymmetric loss function for peak shaving, capturing the cost of battery cycling, and the role of battery duration. In the applied portion of our work, we calibrate our model to a collection of 140+ wind-battery assets in Texas, benchmarking the economic benefits of firming based on outputs of a realistic unit commitment and economic dispatch solver.</description>
