      <title>Can a Machine be Conscious? Towards Universal Criteria for Machine Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificially intelligent systems become more anthropomorphic and pervasive, and their potential impact on humanity more urgent, discussions about the possibility of machine consciousness have significantly intensified, and it is sometimes seen as 'the holy grail'. Many concerns have been voiced about the ramifications of creating an artificial conscious entity. This is compounded by a marked lack of consensus around what constitutes consciousness and by an absence of a universal set of criteria for determining consciousness. By going into depth on the foundations and characteristics of consciousness, we propose five criteria for determining whether a machine is conscious, which can also be applied more generally to any entity. This paper aims to serve as a primer and stepping stone for researchers of consciousness, be they in philosophy, computer science, medicine, or any other field, to further pursue this holy grail of philosophy, neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Interactive Manipulation and Visualization of 3D Brain MRI for Surgical Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern medical diagnostics, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important technique that provides detailed insights into anatomical structures. In this paper, we present a comprehensive methodology focusing on streamlining the segmentation, reconstruction, and visualization process of 3D MRI data. Segmentation involves the extraction of anatomical regions with the help of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. Then, 3D reconstruction converts segmented data from the previous step into multiple 3D representations. Finally, the visualization stage provides efficient and interactive presentations of both 2D and 3D MRI data. Integrating these three steps, the proposed system is able to augment the interpretability of the anatomical information from MRI scans according to our interviews with doctors. Even though this system was originally designed and implemented as part of human brain haptic feedback simulation for surgeon training, it can also provide experienced medical practitioners with an effective tool for clinical data analysis, surgical planning and other purposes</description>

      <title>Sparse Bayesian Correntropy Learning for Robust Muscle Activity Reconstruction from Noisy Brain Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Bayesian learning has promoted many effective frameworks for brain activity decoding, especially for the reconstruction of muscle activity. However, existing sparse Bayesian learning mainly employs Gaussian distribution as error assumption in the reconstruction task, which is not necessarily the truth in the real-world application. On the other hand, brain recording is known to be highly noisy and contains many non-Gaussian noises, which could lead to significant performance degradation for sparse Bayesian learning method. The goal of this paper is to propose a new robust implementation for sparse Bayesian learning, so that robustness and sparseness can be realized simultaneously. Motivated by the great robustness of maximum correntropy criterion (MCC), we proposed an integration of MCC into the sparse Bayesian learning regime. To be specific, we derived the explicit error assumption inherent in the MCC and then leveraged it for the likelihood function. Meanwhile, we used the automatic relevance determination (ARD) technique for the sparse prior distribution. To fully evaluate the proposed method, a synthetic dataset and a real-world muscle activity reconstruction task with two different brain modalities were employed. Experimental results showed that our proposed sparse Bayesian correntropy learning framework improves significantly the robustness in a noisy regression task. The proposed method can realize higher correlation coefficient and lower root mean squared error in the real-world muscle activity reconstruction tasks. Sparse Bayesian correntropy learning provides a powerful tool for neural decoding which can promote the development of brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>The largest EEG-based BCI reproducibility study for open science: the MOABB benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective. This study conduct an extensive Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) reproducibility analysis on open electroencephalography datasets, aiming to assess existing solutions and establish open and reproducible benchmarks for effective comparison within the field. The need for such benchmark lies in the rapid industrial progress that has given rise to undisclosed proprietary solutions. Furthermore, the scientific literature is dense, often featuring challenging-to-reproduce evaluations, making comparisons between existing approaches arduous.
  Approach. Within an open framework, 30 machine learning pipelines (separated into raw signal: 11, Riemannian: 13, deep learning: 6) are meticulously re-implemented and evaluated across 36 publicly available datasets, including motor imagery (14), P300 (15), and SSVEP (7). The analysis incorporates statistical meta-analysis techniques for results assessment, encompassing execution time and environmental impact considerations.
  Main results. The study yields principled and robust results applicable to various BCI paradigms, emphasizing motor imagery, P300, and SSVEP. Notably, Riemannian approaches utilizing spatial covariance matrices exhibit superior performance, underscoring the necessity for significant data volumes to achieve competitive outcomes with deep learning techniques. The comprehensive results are openly accessible, paving the way for future research to further enhance reproducibility in the BCI domain.
  Significance. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to establishing a rigorous and transparent benchmark for BCI research, offering insights into optimal methodologies and highlighting the importance of reproducibility in driving advancements within the field.</description>

      <title>Tests for partial correlation between repeatedly observed nonstationary nonlinear timeseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe two families of statistical tests to detect partial correlation in vectorial timeseries. The tests measure whether an observed timeseries Y can be predicted from a second series X, even after accounting for a third series Z which may correlate with X. They do not make any assumptions on the nature of these timeseries, such as stationarity or linearity, but they do require that multiple statistically independent recordings of the 3 series are available. Intuitively, the tests work by asking if the series Y recorded on one experiment can be better predicted from X recorded on the same experiment than on a different experiment, after accounting for the prediction from Z recorded on both experiments.</description>

      <title>Achieving More Human Brain-Like Vision via Human EEG Representational Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advancements in artificial intelligence, object recognition models still lag behind in emulating visual information processing in human brains. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using neural data to mimic brain processing; however, these often rely on invasive neural recordings from non-human subjects, leaving a critical gap in understanding human visual perception. Addressing this gap, we present, for the first time, 'Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net', a vision model aligned with human brain activity based on non-invasive EEG, demonstrating a significantly higher similarity to human brain representations. Our innovative image-to-brain multi-layer encoding framework advances human neural alignment by optimizing multiple model layers and enabling the model to efficiently learn and mimic human brain's visual representational patterns across object categories and different modalities. Our findings suggest that ReAlnet represents a breakthrough in bridging the gap between artificial and human vision, and paving the way for more brain-like artificial intelligence systems.</description>
