      <title>Impact of Clustering on the Observability and Controllability of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and interconnectedness of systems across various fields have led to a growing interest in studying complex networks, particularly Scale-Free (SF) networks, which best model real-world systems. This paper investigates the influence of clustering on the observability and controllability of complex SF networks, framing these characteristics in the context of structured systems theory. In this paper, we show that densely clustered networks require fewer driver and observer nodes due to better information propagation within clusters. This relationship is of interest for optimizing network design in applications such as social networks and intelligent transportation systems. We first quantify the network observability/controllability requirements, and then, through Monte-Carlo simulations and different case studies, we show how clustering affects these metrics. Our findings offer practical insights into reducing control and observer nodes for sensor/actuator placement, particularly in resource-constrained setups. This work contributes to the understanding of network observability/controllability and presents techniques for improving these features through alterations in network structure and clustering.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Intelligent Low-Altitude Economy Deployments: The O-RAN Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in low-altitude economy (LAE) applications, including UAV-based logistics and emergency response, fundamental challenges remain in orchestrating such missions over complex, signal-constrained environments. These include the absence of real-time, resilient, and context-aware orchestration of aerial nodes with limited integration of artificial intelligence (AI) specialized for LAE missions. This paper introduces an open radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled LAE framework that leverages seamless coordination between the disaggregated RAN architecture, open interfaces, and RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to facilitate closed-loop, AI-optimized, and mission-critical LAE operations. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed architecture via a semantic-aware rApp that acts as a terrain interpreter, offering semantic guidance to a reinforcement learning-enabled xApp, which performs real-time trajectory planning for LAE swarm nodes. We survey the capabilities of UAV testbeds that can be leveraged for LAE research, and present critical research challenges and standardization needs.</description>

      <title>Impact Assessment of Heterogeneous Grid Support Functions in Smart Inverter Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decarbonization of the energy sector has led to a significant high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems, in low-voltage (LV) distribution networks. To maintain grid stability, recent standards (e.g., IEEE 1547-2018) mandate DERs to provide grid-support functionalities through smart inverters (SIs), which typically operate autonomously based on local measurements. However, as DER penetration increases, uncoordinated control modes of SIs can lead to adverse interactions, compromising system efficiency, voltage regulation, and overall stability. While previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of coordinated inverter control and optimal dispatch strategies, the system-wide impacts of heterogeneous SI groups operating under different control modes remain largely unexamined. This paper addresses this gap by assessing the dynamic interactions among multiple SI groups with varying control strategies, namely: Constant Power Factor (CPF), Volt-VAR, and Volt-Watt modes. Furthermore, the analysis covers both resistive and inductive feeder types. The validation is performed using a real-time setup. The CIRGE low-voltage (LV) distribution network is simulated in the Opal-RT platform as the test network, enabling realistic and high-fidelity evaluation of SI control interactions under practical grid conditions.</description>

      <title>Safety for Weakly-Hard Control Systems via Graph-Based Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancement in technology, communication and computational failures are still prevalent in safety-critical engineering applications. Often, networked control systems experience packet dropouts, leading to open-loop behavior that significantly affects the behavior of the system. Similarly, in real-time control applications, control tasks frequently experience computational overruns and thus occasionally no new actuator command is issued. This article addresses the safety verification and controller synthesis problem for a class of control systems subject to weakly-hard constraints, i.e., a set of window-based constraints where the number of failures are bounded within a given time horizon. The results are based on a new notion of graph-based barrier functions that are specifically tailored to the considered system class, offering a set of constraints whose satisfaction leads to safety guarantees despite communication failures. Subsequent reformulations of the safety constraints are proposed to alleviate conservatism and improve computational tractability, and the resulting trade-offs are discussed. Finally, several numerical case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Probability-Aware Parking Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current parking navigation systems often underestimate total travel time by failing to account for the time spent searching for a parking space, which significantly affects user experience, mode choice, congestion, and emissions. To address this issue, this paper introduces the probability-aware parking selection problem, which aims to direct drivers to the best parking location rather than straight to their destination. An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed for decision-making based on probabilistic information about parking availability at the parking lot level. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Acknowledging the financial costs of permanent sensing infrastructure, the paper provides analytical and empirical assessments of errors incurred when leveraging stochastic observations to estimate parking availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency grows. In data-based simulations, probability-aware strategies demonstrate time savings up to 66% relative to probability-unaware baselines, yet still take up to 123% longer than direct-to-destination estimates.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport-Based Decentralized Multi-Agent Distribution Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized control framework for distribution matching in multi-agent systems (MAS), where agents collectively achieve a prescribed terminal spatial distribution. The problem is formulated using optimal transport (Wasserstein distance), which provides a principled measure of distributional discrepancy and serves as the basis for the control design. To avoid solving the global optimal transport problem directly, the distribution-matching objective is reformulated into a tractable per-agent decision process, enabling each agent to identify its desired terminal locations using only locally available information. A sequential weight-update rule is introduced to construct feasible local transport plans, and a memory-based correction mechanism is incorporated to maintain reliable operation under intermittent and range-limited communication. Convergence guarantees are established, showing cycle-wise improvement of a surrogate transport cost under both linear and nonlinear agent dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves effective and scalable distribution matching while operating fully in a decentralized manner.</description>

      <title>Stability Verification for Switched Systems using Neural Multiple Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability analysis of switched systems, characterized by multiple operational modes and switching signals, is challenging due to their nonlinear dynamics. While frameworks such as multiple Lyapunov functions (MLF) provide a foundation for analysis, their computational applicability is limited for systems without favorable structure. This paper investigates stability analysis for switched systems under state-dependent switching conditions. We propose neural multiple Lyapunov functions (NMLF), a unified framework that combines the theoretical guarantees of MLF with the computational efficiency of neural Lyapunov functions (NLF). Our approach leverages a set of tailored loss functions and a counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) scheme to train neural networks that rigorously satisfy MLF conditions. Through comprehensive simulations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate NMLF's effectiveness and its potential for practical deployment in complex switched systems.</description>

      <title>A formal theory on problem space as a semantic world model in systems engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classic problem-space theory models problem solving as a navigation through a structured space of states, operators, goals, and constraints. Systems Engineering (SE) employs analogous constructs (functional analysis, operational analysis, scenarios, trade studies), yet still lacks a rigorous systems-theoretic representation of the problem space itself. In current practice, reasoning often proceeds directly from stakeholder goals to prescriptive artifacts. This makes foundational assumptions about the operational environment, admissible interactions, and contextual conditions implicit or prematurely embedded in architectures or requirements. This paper addresses that gap by formalizing the problem space as an explicit semantic world model containing theoretical constructs that are defined prior to requirements and solution commitments. These constructs along with the developed axioms, theorems and corollary establish a rigorous criterion for unambiguous boundary semantics, context-dependent interaction traceability to successful stakeholder goal satisfaction, and sufficiency of problem-space specification over which disciplined reasoning can occur independent of solution design. It offers a clear distinction between what is true of the problem domain and what is chosen as a solution. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of the theory on practitioners and provides a dialogue-based hypothetical case study between a stakeholder and an engineer, demonstrating how the theory guides problem framing before designing any prescriptive artifacts.</description>

      <title>Can Optimal Transport Improve Federated Inverse Reinforcement Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In robotics and multi-agent systems, fleets of autonomous agents often operate in subtly different environments while pursuing a common high-level objective. Directly pooling their data to learn a shared reward function is typically impractical due to differences in dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited communication bandwidth. This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure. We further prove that this barycentric fusion yields a more faithful global reward estimate than conventional parameter averaging methods in federated learning. Overall, this work provides a principled and communication-efficient framework for deriving a shared reward that generalizes across heterogeneous agents and environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, projected to exceed 30 billion interconnected devices by 2030, has significantly escalated the complexity of cybersecurity challenges. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of vulnerabilities, threats, and defense mechanisms, specifically focusing on the integration of network and application layers within real-time monitoring and decision-making systems. Employing an integrative review methodology, 59 scholarly articles published between 2009 and 2024 were selected from databases such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and PubMed, utilizing keywords related to IoT vulnerabilities and security attacks. Key findings identify critical threat categories, including sensor vulnerabilities, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and public cloud insecurity. Conversely, the study highlights advanced defense approaches leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for anomaly detection, Blockchain for decentralized trust, and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) for continuous verification. This paper contributes a novel five-layer IoT model and outlines future research directions involving quantum computing and 6G networks to bolster IoT ecosystem resilience.</description>

      <title>NMPC-Augmented Visual Navigation and Safe Learning Control for Large-Scale Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large-scale mobile robot (LSMR) is a high-order multibody system that often operates on loose, unconsolidated terrain, which reduces traction. This paper presents a comprehensive navigation and control framework for an LSMR that ensures stability and safety-defined performance, delivering robust operation on slip-prone terrain by jointly leveraging high-performance techniques. The proposed architecture comprises four main modules: (1) a visual pose-estimation module that fuses onboard sensors and stereo cameras to provide an accurate, low-latency robot pose, (2) a high-level nonlinear model predictive control that updates the wheel motion commands to correct robot drift from the robot reference pose on slip-prone terrain, (3) a low-level deep neural network control policy that approximates the complex behavior of the wheel-driven actuation mechanism in LSMRs, augmented with robust adaptive control to handle out-of-distribution disturbances, ensuring that the wheels accurately track the updated commands issued by high-level control module, and (4) a logarithmic safety module to monitor the entire robot stack and guarantees safe operation. The proposed low-level control framework guarantees uniform exponential stability of the actuation subsystem, while the safety module ensures the whole system-level safety during operation. Comparative experiments on a 6,000 kg LSMR actuated by two complex electro-hydrostatic drives, while synchronizing modules operating at different frequencies.</description>

      <title>From 2D to 3D terrain-following area coverage path planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algorithm for 3D terrain-following area coverage path planning is presented. Multiple adjacent paths are generated that are (i) locally apart from each other by a distance equal to the working width of a machinery, while (ii) simultaneously floating at a projection distance equal to a specific working height above the terrain. The complexities of the algorithm in comparison to its 2D equivalent are highlighted. These include uniformly spaced elevation data generation using an Inverse Distance Weighting-approach and a local search. Area coverage path planning results for real-world 3D data within an agricultural context are presented to validate the algorithm.</description>

      <title>ARISE: Adaptive Reinforcement Integrated with Swarm Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective exploration remains a key challenge in RL, especially with non-stationary rewards or high-dimensional policies. We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance. Overall, ARISE offers a simple, architecture-agnostic route to more exploratory and resilient RL agents without altering core algorithmic structures.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Actor-Critic: Mitigating Overestimation via Temporal Aleatoric Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning train a critic with temporal-difference updates and use it as a learning signal for the policy (actor). This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.</description>

Abstract: This paper highlights an apparent, yet relatively unknown link between algorithm design in optimization theory and controller synthesis in robust control. Specifically, quadratic optimization can be recast as a regulation problem within the framework of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control. From this vantage point, the optimality of Polyak's fastest heavy-ball algorithm can be ascertained as a solution to a gain margin optimization problem. The approach is independent of Polyak's original and brilliant argument, and relies on foundational work by Tannenbaum, who introduced and solved gain margin optimization via Nevanlinna--Pick interpolation theory. The link between first-order optimization methods and robust control sheds new light on the limits of algorithmic performance of such methods, and suggests a framework where similar computational tasks can be systematically studied and algorithms optimized. In particular, it raises the question as to whether periodically scheduled algorithms can achieve faster rates for quadratic optimization, in a manner analogous to periodic control that extends the gain margin beyond that of time-invariant control. This turns out not to be the case, due to the analytic obstruction of a transmission zero that is inherent in causal schemes. Interestingly, this obstruction can be removed with implicit algorithms, cast as feedback regulation problems with causal, but not strictly causal dynamics, thereby devoid of the transmission zero at infinity and able to achieve superior convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Sampled-data Systems: Stability, Contractivity and Single-iteration Suboptimal MPC</title>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the stability of interconnected continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) systems coupled through sampling and zero-order hold mechanisms. The DT system updates its output at regular intervals $T&gt;0$ by applying an $n$-fold composition of a given map. This setup is motivated by online and sampled-data implementations of optimization-based controllers - particularly model predictive control (MPC) - where the DT system models $n$ iterations of an algorithm approximating the solution of an optimization problem.
  We introduce the concept of a reduced model, defined as the limiting behavior of the sampled-data system as $T \to 0^+$ and $n \to +\infty$. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that when the reduced model is contractive, there exists a threshold duration $T(n)$ for each iteration count $n$ such that the CT-DT interconnection achieves exponential stability for all sampling periods $T &lt; T(n)$. Finally, under the stronger condition that both the CT and DT systems are contractive, we show exponential stability of their interconnection using a small-gain argument. Our theoretical results provide new insights into suboptimal MPC stability, showing that convergence guarantees hold even when using a single iteration of the optimization algorithm - a practically significant finding for real-time control applications.</description>

      <title>KAN-Therm: A Lightweight Battery Thermal Model Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A battery management system (BMS) relies on real-time estimation of battery temperature distribution in battery cells to ensure safe and optimal operation of Lithium-ion batteries. However, physical BMS often suffers from memory and computational resource limitations required by high-fidelity models. Temperature estimation of batteries for safety-critical systems using physics-based models on physical BMS can potentially become challenging due to their higher computational time. In contrast, neural network based approaches offer faster estimation but require greater memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) based thermal model, KAN-therm, to estimate the core temperature of a cylindrical battery. Unlike traditional neural network architectures, KAN uses learnable nonlinear activation functions that can effectively capture system complexity using relatively lean models. We have compared the memory overhead and estimation time of our model with state-of-the-art neural network models to demonstrate the applicability and potential scalability of KAN-therm on a physical BMS.</description>

      <title>Hybrid A* Path Planning with Multi-Modal Motion Extension for Four-Wheel Steering Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of 4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A* framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin based Automatic Reconfiguration of Robotic Systems in Smart Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic systems have become integral to smart environments, enabling applications ranging from urban surveillance and automated agriculture to industrial automation. However, their effective operation in dynamic settings - such as smart cities and precision farming - is challenged by continuously evolving topographies and environmental conditions. Traditional control systems often struggle to adapt quickly, leading to inefficiencies or operational failures. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for autonomous and dynamic reconfiguration of robotic controllers using Digital Twin technology. Our approach leverages a virtual replica of the robot's operational environment to simulate and optimize movement trajectories in response to real-world changes. By recalculating paths and control parameters in the Digital Twin and deploying the updated code to the physical robot, our method ensures rapid and reliable adaptation without manual intervention. This work advances the integration of Digital Twins in robotics, offering a scalable solution for enhancing autonomy in smart, dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Iterative Tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robotic Manufacturing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manufacturing processes are often perturbed by drifts in the environment and wear in the system, requiring control re-tuning even in the presence of repetitive operations. This paper presents an iterative learning framework for automatic tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) weighting matrices based on task-level performance feedback. Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm. The method offers a practical solution for adaptive NMPC tuning in repetitive robotic tasks, combining the precision of carefully optimized controllers with the flexibility of online adaptation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning Guided by Bias-Noise-Alignment Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference (TD) error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Within this framework, we introduce three diagnostic-driven instantiations: the Human-inspired Supervised Adaptive Optimizer (HSAO), Hybrid Error-Diagnostic Reinforcement Learning (HED-RL) for actor-critic methods, and the Meta-Learned Learning Policy (MLLP). Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to TD error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.</description>
