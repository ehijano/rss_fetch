      <title>Elasticity of Orders with Prime Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the factorization properties of orders of algebraic rings of integers which have conductor ideals prime in the ring of integers. Most significantly, we prove that despite failing to be Dedekind in general, the elasticity of such an order is still determined by the Davenport constant of its class group.</description>

      <title>On Artin algebras whose indecomposable modules are determined by composition factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured at the end of the book "Representation theory of Artin algebras" by M. Auslander, I. Reiten and S. Smalo that an Artin algebra with the property that its finitely generated indecomposable modules are up to isomorphism completely determined by theirs composition factors is of finite representation type. Examples of rings with this property are the semisimple artinian rings and the rings of the form $\mathbb{Z}_n$. An affirmative answer is obtained for some special cases, namely, the commutative, the hereditary and the radical square zero case.</description>

      <title>Some New Classes of Rings Which Have the McCoy Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define here the notion of a {\it weakly reversible ring} $R$ saying that a non-zero element $a\in R$ is weakly reversible if there exists an integer $m&gt;0$ depending on $a$ such that $a^m\neq 0$ is reversible, that is, $r_R(a^m)=l_R(a^m)$. In addition, $R$ is weakly reversible if all its elements are weakly reversible. It is shown that all weakly reversible rings are abelian McCoy rings and so, particularly, they are abelian 2-primal rings. Moreover, we construct a weakly reversible ring which is {\it not} reversible. We also show that if $R$ is a weakly reversible ring, then the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is strongly AB. Thus, in particular, the weakly reversible ring $R$ is zip if, and only if, $R[x]$ is zip. We, moreover, prove that if $R$ is a weakly reversible ring and every prime ideal of $R$ is maximal, then both $R$ and $R[x]$ are AB rings.</description>

      <title>Topics in higher ramification theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study several notions in the setting of higher ramification theory, in particular ramification ideals and differents. After general results on the computation of ramification ideals, we discuss their connection with defect and compute them for Artin-Schreier extensions and Kummer extensions of prime degree equal to the residue degree, with or without defect. We present an example that shows that nontrivial defect in an extension of degree not a pime may not imply the existence of a nonprincipal ramification ideal. We compute differents for the mentioned extensions of prime degree, after computing the necessary traces, and discuss the question when they are equal to the annihilator of the K\"ahler differentials of the extension. Further, we introduce and study the ideal generated by the differents of the elements of the upper valuation rings in such extensions.</description>

      <title>On the existence of maximizing curves of odd degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide the non-existence criterion for the so-called maximizing curves of odd degrees. Furthermore, in the light of our criterion, we define a new class of plane curves that generalizes the notion of maximizing curves which we call as $M$-curves.</description>
