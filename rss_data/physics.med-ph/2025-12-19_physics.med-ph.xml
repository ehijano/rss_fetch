      <title>Back with Weight: Revisiting Very Heavy Ions for Precision Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerated charged particles offer significant physical advantages over X-rays in radiotherapy. In addition to their superior depth-dose distribution, heavy ions provide notable biological benefits compared to protons. Specifically, at therapeutic energies, very heavy ions are expected to exhibit high relative biological effectiveness and a low oxygen enhancement ratio, making them potentially ideal for treating radioresistant tumors. Over fifty years ago, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory started a clinical trial to treat cancer patients with particles ranging from helium to argon. However, treatments with ions of atomic number greater than 10 proved highly toxic to normal tissue. Most patients were ultimately treated with helium ions, whose biological effects closely resemble those of protons. In recent years, novel strategies have emerged that can reduce normal tissue toxicity in radiotherapy while preserving tumor control. These advancements open the possibility of revisiting the clinical use of heavier ions. In this paper, we propose that neon ions may serve as an effective modality for treating resistant, hypoxic tumors. Their associated toxicity may be mitigated by employing approaches such as ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) or spatially fractionated radiotherapy. Current plans and prospects for the clinical application of neon ions will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Endorsing Titanium-Scandium Radionuclide Generator for PET and Positronium Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of PET and positronium imaging techniques is strictly related to the availability of suitable radionuclides and robust radiochemistry platforms. Among the emerging candidates, $^{44}$Sc has attracted significant interest due to its favourable physical properties, including a half-life of $\sim$4 hours, a pure $\beta^{+}$ emission profile, and the additional prompt $\gamma$-emission that enables advanced triple-photon detection schemes. These characteristics make $^{44}$Sc particularly promising for highresolution imaging and novel quantitative methodologies. However, routine clinical and preclinical implementation requires a practical, sustainable, and cost-efficient production route. In this context, we propose a titanium-scandium radionuclide generator as an optimal solution. This study focuses on optimising the synthesis of the long-lived parent isotope, $^{44}$Ti ($T_{1/2}$ = 59.1 years), from which $^{44}$Sc can be selectively eluted in a chemically pure form when needed. An analysis of various production pathways was conducted, including proton and deuteron reactions on scandium, as well as $\alpha$-particle and lithium-induced reactions on calcium, to determine the most efficient reaction parameters, target design, and expected yield. Furthermore, we identify some existing cyclotron facilities suitable for implementing this technology. Results indicate that efficient $^{44}$Ti production is achievable using proton beams in the 20-30 MeV range under extended irradiation conditions. The proposed generator system would enable routine and decentralised $^{44}$Sc supply. Its integration with the novel J-PET scanner may significantly reduce diagnostic costs and improve access to advanced PET imaging in regions with limited medical imaging infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Clinical beam test of inter- and intra-fraction relative range monitoring in carbon ion radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction Vertex Imaging (IVI) is used for range monitoring (RM) in carbon ion radiotherapy. The purpose of RM is to measure the Bragg peak (BP) position for each contributing beam, and detect any changes. Currently, there is no consensus on a clinical RM method, the use of which would improve the safety and consistency of treatment. The prototype filtered IVI (fIVI) Range Monitoring System is the first system to apply large-area and high-rate-capable silicon detectors to IVI. Two layers of these detectors track prompt secondary fragments for use in RM. This device monitored 16 cm and 32 cm diameter cylindrical plastic phantoms irradiated by clinical carbon ion beams at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center. Approximately 20 different BP depths were delivered to each phantom, with a minimum depth difference of 0.8 mm and a maximum depth difference of 51.9 mm and 82.5 mm respectively. For large BP range differences, the relationship between the true depth difference and that measured by fIVI is quadratic, although for small differences, the deviation from a linear relationship with a slope of 1 is negligible. RM performance is strongly dependent on the number of tracked particles, particularly in the clinically-relevant regime. Significant performance differences exist between the two phantoms, with millimetric precision at clinical doses being achieved only for the 16 cm phantom. The performance achieved by the prototype fIVI Range Monitoring System is consistent with previous investigations of IVI, despite measuring at more challenging shallow BP positions. Further significant improvements are possible through increasing the sensitive area of the tracking system beyond the prototype, which will both allow an improvement in precision for the most intense points of a scanned treatment plan and expand the number of points for which millimetric precision may be achieved.</description>

      <title>A parallel, pipeline-based online analysis system for Interaction Vertex Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective
  Interaction vertex imaging (IVI) is used for range monitoring in carbon ion radiotherapy, detecting depth differences between Bragg peak positions. Online range monitoring, which provides feedback during beam delivery, is particularly desirable, creating an opportunity to detect range errors before the treatment fraction is completed. Incorporating online range monitoring into clinical workflows may therefore improve the safety and consistency of radiotherapy.
  Approach
  The data analysis system was broken into a task-parallel pipeline approach, to allow multiple analysis stages to occur concurrently, beginning during acquisition. Computationally-expensive operations were further parallelized to reduce bottleneck effects. Data collected from irradiation of homogeneous plastic phantoms was replayed at the same rate it was initially acquired, to mimic data acquisition, and the time required to determine a range shift was measured.
  Main Results
  With an optimized pipeline, the delay between the end of irradiation and the determination of a range shift is consistently less than 200 ms. The majority of this time is associated with the final range shift determination, with a minor effect from the time required to analyze the last data packet. The most significant contribution to an optimized analysis workflow is the formation of clusters, requiring almost 50% of compute time.
  Significance
  This system is the first IVI implementation to achieve clinically-relevant online analysis times. The 200 ms time required to determine a range shift is less than the time required to accelerate a new spill in a synchrotron, and is comparable to the time required for reacceleration if multiple energies are delivered in the same spill. Clinical implementation of online range monitoring would allow treatment to be quickly paused or aborted if significant range errors are detected.</description>

      <title>ResDynUNet++: A nested U-Net with residual dynamic convolution blocks for dual-spectral CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid reconstruction framework for dual-spectral CT (DSCT) that integrates iterative methods with deep learning models. The reconstruction process consists of two complementary components: a knowledge-driven module and a data-driven module. In the knowledge-driven phase, we employ the oblique projection modification technique (OPMT) to reconstruct an intermediate solution of the basis material images from the projection data. We select OPMT for this role because of its fast convergence, which allows it to rapidly generate an intermediate solution that successfully achieves basis material decomposition. Subsequently, in the data-driven phase, we introduce a novel neural network, ResDynUNet++, to refine this intermediate solution. The ResDynUNet++ is built upon a UNet++ backbone by replacing standard convolutions with residual dynamic convolution blocks, which combine the adaptive, input-specific feature extraction of dynamic convolution with the stable training of residual connections. This architecture is designed to address challenges like channel imbalance and near-interface large artifacts in DSCT, producing clean and accurate final solutions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Pixel Super-Resolved Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful quantitative technique that provides metabolic and molecular contrast, offering strong translational potential for label-free, real-time diagnostics. However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a large-area double-sided silicon strip detector for quality assurance in ion-beam radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designed to provide quality assurance for ion-beam radiotherapy, the prototype fIVI (filtered Interaction Vertex Imaging) Range Monitoring System is a two-layer tracker which employs double-sided strip-segmented silicon detectors. To meet the high demands of a clinical environment, a large sensitive area is required, along with a fast and compact readout. As this device utilizes sensors and readout electronics adapted from particle physics, where the expected energy and count rate differ significantly from radiotherapy, validation was necessary to ensure that these sensors would function effectively at the order 100 MeV/u energies and order MHz count rates expected during clinical irradiation. Tests were conducted using scattered subclinical 19 MeV protons at high intensity, and clinical 207 MeV/u carbon ions at low intensity to independently validate these variables. The detection system is found to operate at rates up to 1.3 MHz, with a negligible fraction of events being affected by pileup. The efficiency of hit reconstruction is high, with a timestamp resolution of 6.25 ns, and a coincidence window of 31.25 ns, as is required for clinical event rates. With these settings, over 90% of particle interactions are able to reconstruct unique hit positions and contribute to track formation. This device is the first system using large-area, high-resolution detectors which meets the demanding count rate requirements associated with clinical radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Root Cause Analysis of Radiation Oncology Incidents Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose To evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in performing root cause analysis (RCA) of radiation oncology incidents using narrative reports from the Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System (RO-ILS), and to assess their potential utility in supporting patient safety efforts.
  Methods and Materials Four LLMs, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, o3, and Grok 3, were prompted with the 'Background and Incident Overview' sections of 19 public RO-ILS cases. Using a standardized prompt based on AAPM RCA guidelines, each model was instructed to identify root causes, lessons learned, and suggested actions. Outputs were assessed using semantic similarity metrics (cosine similarity via Sentence Transformers), semi-subjective evaluations (precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, hallucination rate, and four performance criteria: relevance, comprehensiveness, justification, and solution quality), and subjective expert ratings (reasoning quality and overall performance) from five board-certified medical physicists.
  Results LLMs showed promising performance. GPT-4o had the highest cosine similarity (0.831), while Gemini 2.5 Pro had the highest recall (0.799) and accuracy (0.918). Hallucination rates ranged from 11% to 61%. Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed others across performance criteria and received the highest expert rating (4.8/5). Statistically significant differences in accuracy, hallucination, and subjective scores were observed (p &lt; 0.05).
  Conclusion LLMs show emerging promise as tools for RCA in radiation oncology. They can generate relevant, accurate analyses aligned with expert judgment and may support incident analysis and quality improvement efforts to enhance patient safety in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Real-time 3D Ultrasonic Needle Tracking with a Photoacoustic Beacon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many minimally invasive procedures, such as core needle biopsy of focal liver lesions, nerve blocks, and fetal and vascular interventions, are typically performed under ultrasound guidance, which provides real-time, high-resolution visualisation of tissue anatomy. Accurate and efficient localisation of the needle tip relative to patient anatomy is essential for guiding the needle towards the procedure target, avoiding adverse events and reducing the need for repeat procedures. However, the 3D nature of the procedure and poor image contrast of the needle in heterogeneous tissue or at steep insertion angles often leads to confusion over the true location of the tip within the 2D guidance images, and existing methods to enhance needle visibility largely remain limited to 2D. Here, we present a novel interventional ultrasound system capable of 2D B-mode imaging and 3D needle tracking. The tip location is determined from the time-of-flight of ultrasound generated by a photoacoustic beacon embedded in the needle bevel and received by a sparse receiver array distributed around the imaging system's curvilinear ultrasound probe. The measured tracking accuracy was better than 2 mm for depths up to 140 mm in water, and approximately 2 mm on average in an ex vivo tissue phantom, with referenced positions derived from X-ray CT. In a usability study involving 12 clinicians performing biopsy procedures in a ex vivo tissue phantom, the failure rate was reduced by 35 %, from 15.8 % to 10.3 % after only a few minutes of training. These results demonstrate that the proposed system has strong potential to support a wide range of minimally invasive procedures by enabling clinicians to accurately target anatomical structures with millimetre-level precision, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of diagnostic sampling and therapeutic delivery or ablation, and reducing the risk of adverse events.</description>
