      <title>A generalisation of Henstock-Kurzweil integral to compact metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a gauge and of a tagged partition (subordinate to a given gauge) by intersections of open and closed sets of a compact metric space extending the corresponding notions in Henstock-Kurzweil integration of real-valued functions with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the unit interval. We show that, for the integration of bounded functions with respect to a normalised Borel measure $\mu$ on a compact metric space, the notion of a gauge and an associated tagged partition, arise naturally from a normalised simple valuation way-below the Borel measure. Then we consider the integration of unbounded functions with respect to a normalised Borel measure on a compact metric space, for which the Lebesgue integral may fail to exist. A pair of a tagged partition and a gauge defines a simple valuation and we introduce a partial order on these pairs, emulating the partial order of simple valuations in the probabilistic power domain. We define the $D_\mu$-integral of a real-valued function with respect to a Borel measure using the limit of the net of the integrals of the simple valuations induced by pairs of tagged partitions and gauges for the function. The $D_\mu$-integral of functions on a compact metric space with respect to a normalised Borel measure satisfies the basic properties of an integral and generalises the Henstock-Kurzweil integral. We show that when the Lebesgue integral of the function exists then the $D_\mu$-integral also exists and they have the same value. We provide a family of real-valued functions on the Cantor space that are $D_\mu$-integrable but not Lebesgue integrable.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Approach for Building Wavelet Bases in \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathbb{R}^m) \) with Optimal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main contribution of this paper is a constructive method for building separable multivariate vector-valued wavelet bases in the general framework of \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathbb{R}^m) \) for any \( d, m \geq 1 \). While separable wavelet bases in \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathbb{R}) \) are well-established and widely applied, the explicit construction of truly vector-valued wavelet bases remains an open problem, even in the simplest case of \( L^2(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}^2) \), let alone in \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R}^2) \). In practice, the conventional approach applies standard separable wavelet bases of \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R}) \) independently to each component of vector-valued signals in \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R}^2) \). However, this approach fails to capture the intrinsic vectorial structure of the signals. To address this limitation, we propose a constructive approach within the vector-valued wavelet framework, providing a systematic method for constructing such bases in the general case of \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathbb{R}^m) \). By linking \( m \)-multiwavelets to vector-valued wavelets, our approach not only enables the systematic construction of separable multivariate bases in \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathbb{R}^m) \) that satisfy the vector-valued multiresolution analysis but also ensures that these bases inherit key structural properties, making them well-suited for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Bessel Potential Spaces and Complex Interpolation: Continuous embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bessel potential spaces, introduced in the 1960s, are derived through complex interpolation between Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, making them intermediate spaces of fractional differentiability order. Bessel potential spaces have recently gained attention due to their identification with the Riesz fractional gradient. This paper explores Bessel potential spaces as complex interpolation spaces, providing original proofs of fundamental properties based on abstract interpolation theory. Main results include a direct proof of norm equivalence, continuous embeddings, and the relationship with Gagliardo spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Lipschitz-Free Space over a simply connected $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ is isometrically isomorphic to a quotient of $L^1(M,TM)$, the integrable vector-valued sections on the manifold, if $M$ is either complete or lies isomorphically inside a complete manifold $N$. Two functions are deemed equivalent in this quotient space if their difference has distributional divergence zero.</description>

      <title>Stable recovery guarantees for blind deconvolution under random mask assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the blind deconvolution problem with modulated inputs, focusing on a measurement model where an unknown blurring kernel $\boldsymbol{h}$ is convolved with multiple random modulations $\{\boldsymbol{d}_l\}_{l=1}^{L}$(coded masks) of a signal $\boldsymbol{x}$, subject to $\ell_2$-bounded noise. We introduce a more generalized framework for coded masks, enhancing the versatility of our approach. Our work begins within a constrained least squares framework, where we establish a robust recovery bound for both $\boldsymbol{h}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}$, demonstrating its near-optimality up to a logarithmic factor. Additionally, we present a new recovery scheme that leverages sparsity constraints on $\boldsymbol{x}$. This approach significantly reduces the sampling complexity to the order of $L=O(\log n)$ when the non-zero elements of $\boldsymbol{x}$ are sufficiently separated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating sparsity constraints yields a refined error bound compared to the traditional constrained least squares model. The proposed method results in more robust and precise signal recovery, as evidenced by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. These findings contribute to advancing the field of blind deconvolution and offer potential improvements in various applications requiring signal reconstruction from modulated inputs.</description>

      <title>Kantorovich duality for optimal transport on completely regular Hausdorff spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two completely regular Hausdorff spaces $X$ and $Y$, two tight Baire measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $X$ and $Y$ respectively and a cost $c: X\times Y\to \R$ bounded continuous such that the family $\{c(\cdot,y): y\in Y\}$ (resp. $\{c(x,\cdot): x\in X\}$) is equicontinuous, it is shown that the Kantorovich primal and dual problems, both have solutions and realize the same value. This extends results known on Polish spaces to the more general class of completely regular Hausdorff spaces.</description>

      <title>Convergence of non-reversible Markov processes via lifting and flow Poincar{\'e} inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for quantitative convergence analysis of non-reversible Markov processes, based on the concept of second-order lifts and a variational approach to hypocoercivity. To this end, we introduce the flow Poincar{\'e} inequality, a space-time Poincar{\'e} inequality along trajectories of the semigroup, and a general divergence lemma based only on the Dirichlet form of an underlying reversible diffusion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to a pair of run-and-tumble particles with jamming, a model from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and several piecewise deterministic Markov processes used in sampling applications, in particular including general stochastic jump kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider wave maps from $(1+d)$-dimensional Minkowski space, $d\geq3$, into rotationally symmetric manifolds which arise from small perturbations of the sphere $\mathbb S^d$. We prove the existence of co-rotational self-similar finite time blowup solutions with smooth blowup profiles. Furthermore, we show the nonlinear asymptotic stability of these solutions under suitably small co-rotational perturbations on the full space.</description>

      <title>On the kernel conditions of operators mapping atoms to molecules in local Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relationship between the operators mapping atoms to molecules in local Hardy spaces $h^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and the size conditions of its kernel. In particular, we show that if the kernel a Calder\'on--Zygmund-type operator satisfies an integral-type size condition and a $T^*-$type cancellation, then the operator maps $h^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ atoms to molecules. On the other hand, assuming that $T$ is an integral type operator bounded on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ that maps atoms to molecules in $h^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$, then the kernel of such operator satisfies the same integral-type size conditions. We also provide the $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $L^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ boundedness for such operators connecting our integral-type size conditions on the kernel with others presented in the literature.</description>

      <title>Non-local boundary energy forms for quasidiscs: Codimension gap and approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider non-local energy forms of fractional Laplace type on quasicircles and prove that they can be approximated by similar energy forms on polygonal curves. The approximation is in terms of generalized Mosco convergence along a sequence of varying Hilbert spaces. The domains of the energy forms are the natural trace spaces, and we focus on the case of quasicircles of Hausdorff dimension greater than one. The jump in Hausdorff dimension results in a mismatch of fractional orders, which we compensate by a suitable choice of kernels. We provide approximations of quasidiscs by polygonal $(\varepsilon,\infty)$-domains with common parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and show convergence results for superpositions of Dirichlet integrals and non-local boundary energy forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stability of abstract differential equations coupled by means of a general algebraic condition. Our approach is based on techniques from operator theory and systems theory, and it allows us to study coupled systems by exploiting properties of the components, which are typically much simpler to analyse. As our main results we establish resolvent estimates and decay rates for abstract boundary-coupled systems. We illustrate the power of the general results by using them to obtain rates of energy decay in coupled systems of one-dimensional wave and heat equations, and in a wave equation with an acoustic boundary condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for a heat equation involving a fractional harmonic oscillator and an exponential nonlinearity. We establish local well-posedness within the appropriate Orlicz spaces. Through the examination of small initial data in suitable Orlicz spaces, we obtain the existence of global weak-mild solutions. Additionally, precise decay estimates are presented for large time, indicating that the decay rate is influenced by the nonlinearity's behavior near the origin. Moreover, we highlight that the existence of local nonnegative classical solutions is no longer guaranteed when certain nonnegative initial data is considered within the appropriate Orlicz space.</description>
