      <title>Performance measurements of the electromagnetic calorimeter and readout electronics system for the DarkQuest experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents performance measurements of a new readout electronics system based on silicon photomultipliers for the PHENIX electromagnetic calorimeter. Installation of the lead-scintillator Shashlik style calorimeter into the SeaQuest/SpinQuest spectrometer has been proposed to broaden the experiment's dark sector search program, an upgrade known as DarkQuest. The calorimeter and electronics system were subjected to testing and calibration at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. Detailed studies of the energy response and resolution, as well as particle identification capabilities, were performed. The background rate in the actual experimental environment was also examined. The system is found to be well-suited for a dark sector search program on the Fermilab 120 GeV proton beamline.</description>

      <title>Development of a Neutron Imager using CMOS Pixelated Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We acquired an image of the Siemens Star Chart using the ${}^{10}$B-INTPIX4 CMOS pixelated imager at J-PARC MLF BL21 (NOVA). The image blurriness, characterized by a root mean square (rms) value of 17 $\mu$m in the line spread function, corresponds to an rms beam divergence of 2.7 mrad. for the neutron beam. This is equivalent to the L/D ratio of 370. The contrast of the image was analyzed as a function of structural scale of the chart, and based on this contrast, the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the imaging system was evaluated. The results indicate that the structure corresponding to the 50% cutoff is 12 line-space pairs per mm.</description>

      <title>The IDEA detector concept for FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detector concept, named IDEA, optimized for the physics and running conditions at the FCC-ee is presented. After discussing the expected running conditions and the main physics drivers, a detailed description of the individual sub-detectors is given. These include: a very light tracking system with a powerful vertex detector inside a large drift chamber surrounded by a silicon wrapper, a high resolution dual readout crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, an HTS based superconducting solenoid, a dual readout fiber calorimeter and three layers of muon chambers embedded in the magnet flux return yoke. Some examples of the expected detector performance, based on fast and full simulation, are also given.</description>

      <title>COCOA: a compact Compton camera for astrophysical observation of MeV-scale gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COCOA (COmpact COmpton cAmera) is a next-generation, cost-effective gamma-ray telescope designed for astrophysical observations in the MeV energy range. The detector comprises a scatterer volume employing the LiquidO detection technology and an array of scintillating crystals acting as absorber. Surrounding plastic scintillator panels serve as a veto system for charged particles. The detector's compact, scalable design enables flexible deployment on microsatellites or high-altitude balloons. Gamma rays at MeV energies have not been well explored historically (the so-called "MeV gap") and COCOA has the potential to improve the sensitivity in this energy band by up to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Self-Triggering for Extensive Air Showers: Performance and FPGA Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray detection with radio antennas has traditionally depended on external triggers from particle detectors, constraining sensitivity and increasing complexity. Previous attempts at fully standalone, radio-only triggers have often failed under intense radio frequency interference, making genuine air-shower signals difficult to isolate. We present a proof-of-principle artificial intelligence-based self-triggering system that overcomes these limitations. By training a deep learning model on both real noise data and injected cosmic-ray-like pulses, we achieve an exceptionally low false-positive rate alongside high detection efficiency. Configurable operating points can suppress false positives below 0.01\% while retaining more than 88\% of genuine signals, and can even eliminate false positives entirely at a modest reduction in signal efficiency. This flexibility makes single-station cosmic-ray detection feasible without requiring external trigger inputs. Applying our approach to real-world noise conditions reduces the initial false-positive event rate by several orders of magnitude, supporting large-scale deployments. Extrapolation to dedicated hardware implementations, such as FPGAs, indicates that sub-\SI{}{\micro\second} inference times are achievable, enabling real-time autonomous triggering. These results highlight the transformative potential of artificial intelligence for enhancing radio detection sensitivity and inaugurate a new generation of fully self-triggered cosmic-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence emission of the JUNO liquid scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JUNO is a huge neutrino detector that will use 20 kton of organic liquid scintillator as its detection medium. The scintillator is a mixture of linear alkyl benzene (LAB), 2.5 g/L of 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) and 3 mg/L of 1,4-Bis(2-methylstyryl)benzene (Bis-MSB). The main goal of JUNO is to determine the Neutrino Mass Ordering [1, 2, 3]. In order to achieve this purpose, good energy and position reconstruction is required, hence a complete understanding of the optical characteristics of the liquid scintillator is mandatory. In this paper we present the measurements on the JUNO scintillator emission spectrum, absorption length and fluorescence time distribution performed respectively with a spectrofluorimeter, a spectrophotometer and a custom made setup</description>

      <title>An experimental platform for levitated mechanics in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>
