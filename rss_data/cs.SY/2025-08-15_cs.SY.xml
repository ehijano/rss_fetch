      <title>Quantifying the Value of Seismic Structural Health Monitoring for post-earthquake recovery of electric power system in terms of resilience enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-earthquake recovery of electric power networks (EPNs) is critical to community resilience. Traditional recovery processes often rely on prolonged and imprecise manual inspections for damage diagnosis, leading to suboptimal repair prioritization and extended service disruptions. Seismic Structural Health Monitoring (SSHM) offers the potential to expedite recovery by enabling more accurate and timely damage assessment. However, SSHM deployment incurs costs, and its system-level resilience benefit remains underexplored. This study proposes a probabilistic simulation framework to quantify the value of SSHM for enhancing EPN resilience. The framework includes seismic damage modeling based on network configuration, hazard intensity, fragility functions, and damage-functionality mappings, combined with recovery simulations incorporating resource constraints, repair and transfer durations. System functionality is evaluated using graph-based island detection and optimal power flow analysis. Resilience is quantified via the Lack of Resilience (LoR) metric derived from the functionality restoration curve. SSHM is incorporated by altering the quality of damage information used in repair scheduling. Different monitoring scenarios (e.g., no-SSHM baseline, partial SSHM, full SSHM with various accuracies) are modeled using confusion matrices to simulate damage misclassification. Results show that improved damage awareness via SSHM significantly accelerates recovery and reduces LoR by up to 21%. This work supports evidence-based decisions for SSHM deployment in critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>A Structured Framework for Prioritizing Unsafe Control Actions in STPA: Case Study on eVTOL Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a widely recommended method for analysing complex system safety. STPA can identify numerous Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) and requirements depending on the level of granularity of the analysis and the complexity of the system being analysed. Managing numerous results is challenging, especially during a fast-paced development lifecycle. Extensive research has been done to optimize the efficiency of managing and prioritising the STPA results. However, maintaining the objectivity of prioritisation and communicating the prioritised results have become common challenges. In this paper, the authors present a complementary approach that incorporates inputs from both the safety analysts and domain experts to more objectively prioritise UCAs. This is done by evaluating the severity of each UCA, the impact factor of each controller or decision maker that issues the UCA, and the ranking provided by the subject matter experts who assess the UCA criticalities based on different factors. In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation is introduced to reduce subjectivity and relativity, thus enabling more objective prioritisation of the UCAs. As part of the approach to better communicate the prioritisation results and plan the next steps of system development, a dynamic-scaling prioritisation matrix was developed to capture different sets of prioritised UCAs. The approach was applied to a real project to improve the safe operations of Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL). The results highlighted critical UCAs that need to be prioritised for safer eVTOL operation. 318 UCAs were identified in total. Based on the application of the prioritisation methodology, 110 were recognized as high-priority UCAs to strengthen the system design.</description>

      <title>Feedback stabilization of a nanoparticle at the intensity minimum of an optical double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop and analyze adaptive feedback control strategies to stabilize and confine a nanoparticle at the unstable intensity minimum of an optical double-well potential. The resulting stochastic optimal control problem for a noise-driven mechanical particle in a nonlinear optical potential must account for unavoidable experimental imperfections such as measurement nonlinearities and slow drifts of the optical setup. To address these issues, we simplify the model in the vicinity of the unstable equilibrium and employ indirect adaptive control techniques to dynamically follow changes in the potential landscape. Our approach leads to a simple and efficient Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller that can be implemented on fast and cost-effective FPGAs, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility. We demonstrate that this strategy successfully tracks the intensity minimum and significantly reduces the nanoparticle's residual state variance, effectively lowering its center-of-mass temperature. While conventional optical traps rely on confining optical forces in the light field at the intensity maxima, trapping at intensity minima mitigates absorption heating, which is crucial for advanced quantum experiments. Since LQG control naturally extends into the quantum regime, our results provide a promising pathway for future experiments on quantum state preparation beyond the current absorption heating limitation, like matter-wave interference and tests of the quantum-gravity interface.</description>

      <title>A Robust Optimization Approach for Demand Response Participation of Fixed-Frequency Air Conditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous increase in the penetration of renewable energy in the emerging power systems, the pressure on system peak regulation has been significantly intensified. Against this backdrop, demand side resources particularly air conditioning loads have garnered considerable attention for their substantial regulation potential and fast response capabilities, making them promising candidates for providing auxiliary peak shaving services. This study focuses on fixed frequency air conditioners (FFACs) and proposes an optimization model and solution method for their participation in demand response (DR) programs. First, a probabilistic response model for FFACs is developed based on the Markov assumption. Second, by sampling this probabilistic model, the aggregate power consumption of an FFAC cluster under decentralized control is obtained. Subsequently, a robust optimization model is formulated to maximize the profit of an aggregator managing the FFAC cluster during DR events, taking into account the aggregated response power. The model explicitly considers temperature uncertainty to ensure user comfort in a robust sense. Finally, leveraging the structure of the proposed model, it is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solved using a commercial optimization solver. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution approach.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting Method for Offshore Wind Farm Cluster under Typhoon Conditions: a Score-Based Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offshore wind power (OWP) exhibits significant fluctuations under typhoon conditions, posing substantial challenges to the secure operation of power systems. Accurate forecasting of OWP is therefore essential. However, the inherent scarcity of historical typhoon data and stochasticity of OWP render traditional point forecasting methods particularly difficult and inadequate. To address this challenge and provide grid operators with the comprehensive information necessary for decision-making, this study proposes a score-based conditional diffusion model (SCDM) for probabilistic forecasting of OWP during typhoon events. First, a knowledge graph algorithm is employed to embed historical typhoon paths as vectors. Then, a deterministic network is constructed to predict the wind power under typhoon conditions based on these vector embeddings. Finally, to better characterize prediction errors, a denoising network is developed. At the core of this approach is a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE), which transforms complex error distributions into a standard Gaussian, enabling the sampling of forecasting errors using a reverse-time SDE. The probabilistic forecasting results are reconstructed by combining deterministic forecasts with sampled errors. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world data from a cluster of 9 offshore wind farms. Results demonstrate that under typhoon conditions, our approach outperforms baseline models for both deterministic and probabilistic metrics, verifying the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional Polarization-Based Coverage Control through Static Passive EMSs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An innovative multi-functional static-passive electromagnetic skin (SP-EMS) solution is proposed to simultaneously support, in reflection, two independent wave-manipulation functionalities with a single meta-atoms arrangement on the EMS aperture when illuminated by two EM sources operating at the same frequency, but working in different polarization states. Towards this end, a simple reference meta-atom is designed first to enable an accurate and independent control of each polarization component of the local reflection tensor. Successively, the macro-scale synthesis of multi-polarization (MP) SP-EMSs (MP-SP-EMSs) is carried out by solving a global optimization problem where a cost function, which mathematically codes separate requirements for each polarization, is minimized with a customized version of the system-by-design (SbD) technique. Representative results from a set of numerical and experimental tests are reported to assess the feasibility of a multi-function EMS based on polarization diversity as well as the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method for the synthesis of MP-SP-EMSs.</description>

      <title>Integrating Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks for Sustainable 6G Operations: A Latency-Aware Multi-Tier Cell-Switching Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainability is paramount in modern cellular networks, which face significant energy consumption challenges from rising mobile traffic and advancements in wireless technology. Cell-switching, well-established in literature as an effective solution, encounters limitations such as inadequate capacity and limited coverage when implemented through terrestrial networks (TN). This study enhances cell-switching by integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTN), including satellites (used for cell-switching for the first time), high altitude platform stations (HAPS), and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) into TN. This integration significantly boosts energy savings by expanding capacity, enhancing coverage, and increasing operational flexibility. We introduce a multi-tier cell-switching approach that dynamically offloads users across network layers to manage energy effectively and minimize delays, accommodating diverse user demands with a context aware strategy. Additionally, we explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, in optimizing network efficiency through data compression, handover optimization between different network layers, and enhancing device compatibility, further improving the adaptability and energy efficiency of cell-switching operations. A case study confirms substantial improvements in network power consumption and user satisfaction, demonstrating the potential of our approach for future networks.</description>

      <title>Fuel Consumption in Platoons: A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platooning has emerged as a promising strategy for improving fuel efficiency in automated vehicle systems, with significant implications for reducing emissions and operational costs. While existing literature on vehicle platooning primarily focuses on individual aspects such as aerodynamic drag reduction or specific control strategies, this work takes a more comprehensive approach by bringing together a wide range of factors and components that contribute to fuel savings in platoons. In this literature review, we examine the impact of platooning on fuel consumption, highlighting the key components of platoon systems, the factors and actors influencing fuel savings, methods for estimating fuel use, and the effect of platoon instability on efficiency. Furthermore, we study the role of reduced aerodynamic drag, vehicle coordination, and the challenges posed by instability in real-world conditions. By compiling insights from recent studies, this work provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in platooning technologies and highlights both the challenges and opportunities for future research to maximize fuel savings in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Detection and Multi-Class Classification of FDI Attacks in Smart Grid Home Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns, which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms, thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid cybersecurity from residential endpoints.</description>

      <title>Distributional Robustness in Output Feedback Regret-Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies distributionally robust regret-optimal (DRRO) control with purified output feedback for linear systems subject to additive disturbances and measurement noise. These uncertainties (including the initial system state) are assumed to be stochastic and distributed according to an unknown joint probability distribution within a Wasserstein ambiguity set. We design affine controllers to minimise the worst-case expected regret over all distributions in this set. The expected regret is defined as the difference between an expected cost incurred by an affine causal controller and the expected cost incurred by the optimal noncausal controller with perfect knowledge of the disturbance trajectory at the outset. Leveraging the duality theory in distributionally robust optimisation, we derive strong duality results for worst-case expectation problems involving general quadratic objective functions, enabling exact reformulations of the DRRO control problem as semidefinite programs (SDPs). Focusing on one such reformulation, we eliminate certain decision variables. This technique also permits a further equivalent reformulation of the SDP as a distributed optimisation problem, with potential to enhance scalability.</description>

      <title>Systematic Constraint Formulation and Collision-Free Trajectory Planning Using Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult. Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver. We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.</description>

      <title>MASH: Cooperative-Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Single Humanoid Robot Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm: applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new insights into efficient locomotion strategies.</description>

      <title>Virtual Sensing for Solder Layer Degradation and Temperature Monitoring in IGBT Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).</description>

      <title>Variance Reduced Policy Gradient Method for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward. This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL, policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces. In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy gradients while maintaining general assumptions.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Deep Neural Networks with Safe Robust Adaptive Control for Reliable Operation of Wheeled Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low computational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However, the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC) policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg WMR.</description>

      <title>Two-Instrument Screening under Soft Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study soft budget constraints in multi-tier public finance when an upper-tier government uses two instruments: an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post rescue. Under convex rescue costs and standard primitives, the three-stage leader-follower problem collapses to one dimensional screening with a single allocation index: the cap on realized rescue. A hazard-based characterization delivers a unified rule that nests (i) no rescue, (ii) a threshold-cap with commitment, and (iii) a threshold--linear--cap without commitment. The knife-edge for eliminating bailouts compares the marginal cost at the origin to the supremum of a virtual weight, and the comparative statics show how greater curvature tightens caps while discretion shifts transfers toward front loading by lowering the effective grant weight. The framework provides a portable benchmark for mechanism design and yields testable implications for policy and empirical work on intergovernmental finance.</description>

      <title>Traffic Intersection Simulation Using Turning Movement Count Data in SUMO: A Case Study of Toronto Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban traffic simulation is vital in planning, modeling, and analyzing road networks. However, the realism of a simulation depends extensively on the quality of input data. This paper presents an intersection traffic simulation tool that leverages real-world vehicle turning movement count (TMC) data from the City of Toronto to model traffic in an urban environment at an individual or multiple intersections using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The simulation performed in this research focuses specifically on intersection-level traffic generation without creating full vehicle routes through the network. This also helps keep the network's complexity to a minimum. The simulated traffic is evaluated against actual data to show that the simulation closely reproduces real intersection flows. This validates that the real data can drive practical simulations, and these scenarios can replace synthetic or random generated data, which is prominently used in developing new traffic-related methodologies. This is the first tool to integrate TMC data from Toronto into SUMO via an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. This work contributes to the research and traffic planning community on data-driven traffic simulation. It provides transportation engineers with a framework to evaluate intersection design and traffic signal optimization strategies using readily available aggregate traffic data.</description>

      <title>Learning Task Execution Hierarchies for Redundant Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks (SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs, balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and reducing the need for expert design.</description>

      <title>CVIRO: A Consistent and Tightly-Coupled Visual-Inertial-Ranging Odometry on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra Wideband (UWB) is widely used to mitigate drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems. Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation accuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states. Furthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO algorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace, thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and consistency compared to existing methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the finite sample identification performance of an n dimensional discrete-time Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Linear Time-Invariant system, with p inputs and m outputs. We prove that the widely-used Ho-Kalman algorithm and Multivariable Output Error State Space (MOESP) algorithm are ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when n/m or n/p is large. Moreover, by analyzing the Cra\'mer-Rao bound, we derive a fundamental limit for identifying the real and stable (or marginally stable) poles of MIMO system and prove that the sample complexity for any unbiased pole estimation algorithm to reach a certain level of accuracy explodes superpolynomially with respect to n/(pm). Numerical results are provided to illustrate the ill-conditionedness of Ho-Kalman algorithm and MOESP algorithm as well as the fundamental limit on identification.</description>

      <title>Unified Performance Control for Non-Square Nonlinear Systems with Relaxed Controllability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of unified prescribed performance tracking for a class of non-square strict-feedback nonlinear systems under relaxed controllability conditions. By using a skillful matrix decomposition and introducing some feasible auxiliary matrices, a more generalized controllability condition than the current state of the art is constructed, which can be applied to both square and non-square nonlinear systems subject to actuator faults and unknown yet time-varying control gain. Incorporating the relaxed controllability conditions and the uniform performance specifications into the backstepping design procedure, a prescribed performance fault-tolerant controller is developed that can achieve different performance demands without modifying the controller structure, which is more flexible and practical.In addition, the destruction of the system stability by unknown controllability auxiliary matrices and unknown nonlinearities is circumvented by embedding the available core information of the state-dependent uncertainties into the design procedure. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On Event-Triggered Resilient Consensus Using Auxiliary Layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to its design simplicity, auxiliary layer-based resilient control is widely discussed in the literature to mitigate the effects of False Data Injection (FDI) attacks. However, the increased communication burden due to additional communication links for connecting an extra layer is often overlooked in the literature. This paper bridges this gap by considering an event-triggered approach for inter-layer communication between the physical layer (containing actual agents) and the auxiliary layer (containing virtual agents) for the resilient state consensus in a multi-agent system. We provide state-based and dynamic event-triggering mechanisms, the former being the motivation for the latter. The exclusion of Zeno behavior is established by proving positive minimum inter-event time (MIET). Extensive simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fault Detection and Isolation in an All-Electric Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Gas Generator by Utilizing Starter/Generator Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel paradigm for enhancing fault detection and isolation (FDI) of gas generators in all-electric auxiliary power unit (APU) by utilizing shaft power information from the starter/generator. First, we conduct a pioneering investigation into the challenges and opportunities for FDI brought about by APU electrification. Our analysis reveals that the electrification of APU opens up new possibilities for utilizing shaft power estimates from starter/generator to improve gas generator FDI. We then provide comprehensive theoretical and analytical evidence demonstrating why, how, and to what extent, the shaft power information from the starter/generator can fundamentally enhance the estimation accuracy of system states and health parameters of the gas generator, while also identifying the key factors influencing these improvements in FDI performance. The effectiveness of the proposed paradigm and its theoretical foundations are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, through comprehensive comparative analysis with state-of-the-art gas generator fault diagnosis methods, our experimental results not only demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach but also validate that the diagnostic capabilities of existing advanced FDI techniques can be substantially enhanced by incorporating shaft power information. And the observed performance improvement patterns strongly align with our theoretical analysis, verifying both the effectiveness and guiding significance of our theoretical framework. These research findings provide a unique perspective in answering three fundamental questions: why joint fault diagnosis of the starter/generator and gas generator is essential, how it can be implemented, and what factors determine its effectiveness, thereby opening up promising new avenues for FDI technologies in all-electric APU systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of incompressible fluid mixing arises in numerous engineering applications and has been well-studied over the years, yet many open questions remain. This paper aims to address the question "what do efficient flow fields for mixing look like, and how do they behave?" We approach this question by developing a framework which is inspired by the dynamic and geometric approach to optimal mass transport. Specifically, we formulate the fluid mixing problem as an optimal control problem where the dynamics are given by the continuity equation together with an incompressibility constraint. We show that within this framework, the set of reachable fluid configurations can formally be endowed with the structure of an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, with a metric which is induced by the control effort, and that flow fields which are maximally efficient at mixing correspond to geodesics in this Riemannian space.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new C++/CUDA library for GPU-accelerated stochastic optimization called MPPI-Generic. It provides implementations of Model Predictive Path Integral control, Tube-Model Predictive Path Integral Control, and Robust Model Predictive Path Integral Control, and allows for these algorithms to be used across many pre-existing dynamics models and cost functions. Furthermore, researchers can create their own dynamics models or cost functions following our API definitions without needing to change the actual Model Predictive Path Integral Control code. Finally, we compare computational performance to other popular implementations of Model Predictive Path Integral Control over a variety of GPUs to show the real-time capabilities our library can allow for.

      <title>TAR: Teacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning for Quadrupedal Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadrupedal locomotion via Reinforcement Learning (RL) is commonly addressed using the teacher-student paradigm, where a privileged teacher guides a proprioceptive student policy. However, key challenges such as representation misalignment between privileged teacher and proprioceptive-only student, covariate shift due to behavioral cloning, and lack of deployable adaptation; lead to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. We propose Teacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning (TAR), a framework that leverages privileged information with self-supervised contrastive learning to bridge this gap. By aligning representations to a privileged teacher in simulation via contrastive objectives, our student policy learns structured latent spaces and exhibits robust generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios, surpassing the fully privileged "Teacher". Results showed accelerated training by 2x compared to state-of-the-art baselines to achieve peak performance. OOD scenarios showed better generalization by 40% on average compared to existing methods. Moreover, TAR transitions seamlessly into learning during deployment without requiring privileged states, setting a new benchmark in sample-efficient, adaptive locomotion and enabling continual fine-tuning in real-world scenarios.

      <title>Sequential QCQP for Bilevel Optimization with Line Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical structure where one problem is nested within another, leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions. We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate in terms of a first-order stationary metric and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.</description>

      <title>Transferable Parasitic Estimation via Graph Contrastive Learning and Label Rebalancing in AMS Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShenShan123/CircuitGCL.</description>

Abstract: Single-input fast optimal control problems, which aim to achieve the optimal objective as fast as possible, occur in various real-world applications. In the case of fast battery charging, the associated optimal control problem becomes computationally challenging when detailed battery models are used. A recent heuristic optimization-free algorithm can significantly reduce the computational cost and provide an approximate solution, consistent with many heuristic input profiles in practice. These heuristic solutions have several special properties: They follow a bang-ride pattern that always activates a constraint and applies the maximum feasible input. This work investigates when the above properties arise in the optimal input, and ultimately, when the heuristic input profiles satisfy necessary optimality conditions. By exploiting Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP), we show that the optimal control is bang-ride under regularity conditions on constraint switching and local controllability of the system. Moreover, the special type of bang-ride behavior, i.e., applying the maximum feasible input, arises under the monotonicity of the system, objective function, and restricted sensitivity of the constraints. These results provide a theoretical justification for a class of charging heuristics and the fast optimization-free algorithm.</description>
