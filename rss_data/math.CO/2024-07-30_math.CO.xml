      <title>How to burn a Latin square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the lazy burning process for Latin squares by studying their associated hypergraphs. In lazy burning, a set of vertices in a hypergraph is initially burned, and that burning spreads to neighboring vertices over time via a specified propagation rule. The lazy burning number is the minimum number of initially burned vertices that eventually burns all vertices. The hypergraphs associated with Latin squares include the $n$-uniform hypergraph, whose vertices and hyperedges correspond to the entries and lines (that is, sets of rows, columns, or symbols) of the Latin square, respectively, and the $3$-uniform hypergraph, which has vertices corresponding to the lines of the Latin square and hyperedges induced by its entries.
  Using sequences of vertices that together form a vertex cover, we show that for a Latin square of order $n$, the lazy burning number of its $n$-uniform hypergraph is bounded below by $n^2-3n+3$ and above by $n^2-3n+2 + \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor.$ These bounds are shown to be tight using cyclic Latin squares and powers of intercalates. For the $3$-uniform hypergraph case, we show that the lazy burning number of Latin squares is one plus its shortest connected chain of subsquares. We determine the lazy burning number of Latin square hypergraphs derived from finitely generated groups. We finish with open problems.</description>

      <title>On cover-free families of finite vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a large literature on cover-free families of finite sets, because of their many applications in combinatorial group testing, cryptographic and communications. This work studies the generalization of cover-free families from sets to finite vector spaces. Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and let $\left[V\atop k\right]_q$ denote the family of all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. A family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \left[V\atop k\right]_q$ is called cover-free if there are no three distinct subspaces $F_{0}, F_{1}, F_{2}\in \mathcal{F}$ such that $F_{0}\leq (F_{0}\cap F_{1})+(F_{0}\cap F_{2})$. A family $\mathcal{H}\subseteq \left[V\atop k\right]_q$ is called a $q$-Steiner system $S_{q}(t, k, n)$ if for every $T\in \left[V\atop t\right]_q$, there is exactly one $H\in \mathcal{H}$ such that $T\leq H$. In this paper we investigate cover-free families in the vector space $V$. Firstly, we determine the maximum size of a cover-free family in $\left[V\atop k\right]_q$. Secondly, we characterize the structures of all maximum cover-free families which are closely related to $q$-Steiner systems.</description>

      <title>On the minimum density of monotone subwords</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic minimum density $f(s,k)$ of monotone $k$-subwords of words over a totally ordered alphabet of size $s$. The unrestricted alphabet case, $f(\infty,k)$, is well-studied, known for $f(\infty,3)$ and $f(\infty,4)$, and, in particular, conjectured to be rational for all $k$. Here we determine $f(2,k)$ for all $k$ and determine $f(3,3)$, which is already irrational. We describe an explicit construction for all $s$ which is conjectured to yield $f(s,3)$. Using our construction and flag algebra, we determine $f(4,3),f(5,3),f(6,3)$ up to $10^{-3}$ yet argue that flag algebra, regardless of computational power, cannot determine $f(5,3)$ precisely. Finally, we prove that for every fixed $k \ge 3$, the gap between $f(s,k)$ and $f(\infty,k)$ is $\Theta(\frac{1}{s})$.</description>

      <title>Colorful positive bases decomposition and Helly-type results for cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following colorful Helly-type result: Fix $k \in [d-1]$. Assume $\mathcal{A}_1, \dots, \mathcal{A}_{d+(d-k)+1}$ are finite sets (colors) of nonzero vectors in $\R^d$. If for every rainbow sub-selection $R$ from these sets of size at most $\max \{d+1, 2(d-k+1)\}$, the system $\langle {a},{x} \rangle \leq 0,\; a \in R$ has at least $k$ linearly independent solutions, then at least one of the systems $\langle {a},{x} \rangle \leq 0,\; a \in \mathcal{A}_i,$ $i \in [d+(d-k)+1]$ has at least $k$ linearly independent solutions.
  A \emph{rainbow sub-selection} from several sets refers to choosing at most one element from each set (color).
  The Helly-number $\max \{d+1, 2(d-k+1)\}$ and the number of colors $d+(d-k)+1$ are optimal.
  Our key observation is a certain colorful Carath\'eodory-type result for positive bases.</description>

      <title>Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture and big Ramsey degrees of structures admitting finite monomorphic decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a countable structure admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if so does every monomorphic part in its minimal monomorphic decomposition. The necessary prerequisite for this result is the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees: a countable monomorphic structure has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if it is chainable by a chain with finite big Ramsey degrees. Interestingly, both characterizations require deep structural properties of chains. Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture (actually, its positive resolution due to Laver) is instrumental in the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, while the analysis of big Ramsey combinatorics of structures admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition requires a product Ramsey theorem for big Ramsey degrees. We find this last result particularly intriguing because big Ramsey degrees misbehave notoriously when it comes to general product statements.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Renormalization: The gravitational path integral, holography, and a gauge group for topology change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Factorization Paradox from the bottom up by adapting methods from perturbative renormalization. Just as quantum field theories are plagued with loop divergences that need to be cancelled systematically by introducing counterterms, gravitational path integrals are plagued by wormhole contributions that spoil the factorization of the holographic dual. These wormholes must be cancelled by some stringy effects in a UV complete, holographic theory of quantum gravity. In a simple model of two-dimensional topological gravity, we outline a gravitational analog of the recursive BPHZ procedure in order to systematically introduce ``counter-wormholes" which parametrize the unknown stringy effects that lead to factorization. Underlying this procedure is a Hopf algebra of symmetries which is analogous to the Connes--Kreimer Hopf algebra underlying perturbative renormalization. The group dual to this Hopf algebra acts to reorganize contributions from spacetimes with distinct topology, and can be seen as a gauge group relating various equivalent ways of constructing a factorizing gravitational path integral.</description>

Abstract: We give analogues in the finite general linear group of two elementary results concerning long cycles and transpositions in the symmetric group: first, that the long cycles are precisely the elements whose minimum-length factorizations into transpositions yield a generating set, and second, that a long cycle together with an appropriate transposition generates the whole symmetric group.</description>

      <title>Two parallel dynamic lexicographic algorithms for factorization sets in numerical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To the existing dynamic algorithm FactorizationsUpToElement for factorization sets of elements in a numerical semigroup, we add lexicographic and parallel behavior. To the existing parallel lexicographic algorithm for the same, we add dynamic behavior. The (dimensionwise) dynamic algorithm is parallelized either elementwise or factorizationwise, while the parallel lexicographic algorithm is made dynamic with low-dimension tabulation. The tabulation for the parallel lexicographic algorithm can itself be performed using the dynamic algorithm. We provide reference CUDA implementations with measured runtimes.</description>

      <title>Four-manifolds defined by vector-colorings of simple polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on the real moment-angle manifold $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P$ over a simple $n$-polytope $P$. The orbit space $N(P,H)=\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ has an action of $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$. For general $n$ we introduce the notion of a Hamiltonian $\mathcal{C}(n,k)$-subcomplex generalizing the three-dimensional notions of a Hamiltonian cycle, theta- and $K_4$-subgraphs. Each $\mathcal{C}(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset \partial P$ corresponds to a subgroup $H_C$ such that $N(P,H_C)\simeq S^n$. We prove that in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. Any subgroup $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ defines a complex $\mathcal{C}(P,H)\subset \partial P$. We prove that each Hamiltonian $\mathcal{C}(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset \mathcal{C}(P,H)$ inducing $H$ corresponds to a hyperelliptic involution $\tau_C\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ on the manifold $N(P,H)$ (that is, an involution with the orbit space homeomorphic to $S^n$) and in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. We prove that for the geometries $\mathbb X= \mathbb S^4$, $\mathbb S^3\times\mathbb R$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb S^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb R^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb L^2$, and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb L^2$ there exists a compact right-angled $4$-polytope $P$ with a free action of $H$ such that the geometric manifold $N(P,H)$ has a hyperelliptic involution in $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, and for $\mathbb X=\mathbb R^4$, $\mathbb L^4$, $\mathbb L^3\times \mathbb R$ and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb R^2$ there are no such polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define and investigate a class of polytopes which we call "vertex generated" consisting of polytopes which are the average of their $0$ and $n$ dimensional faces. We show many results regarding this class, among them: that the class contains all zonotopes, that it is dense in dimension $n=2$, that any polytope can be summed with a zonotope so that the sum is in this class, and that a strong form of the celebrated "Maurey Lemma" holds for polytopes in this class. We introduce for every polytope a parameter which measures how far it is from being vertex-generated, and show that when this parameter is small, strong covering properties hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2021, Andrews mentioned that George Beck introduced a partition statistic $NT(r,m,n)$ which is related to Dyson's rank statistic. Motivated by Andrews's work, scholars have established a number of congruences and identities involving $NT(r,m,n)$. In this paper, we strengthen and extend a recent work of Mao on the transformation properties of the $NT$ function and provide an analogy of Hickerson and Mortenson's work on the rank function. As an application, we demonstrate how one can deduce from our results many identities involving $NT(r,m,n)$ and another crank-analog statistic $M_\omega(r,m,n)$. As a related result, some new properties of generalized Appell-Lerch series are given.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite permutation group acting on a set $\Omega$. An ordered sequence $(\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_\ell)$ of elements of $\Omega$ is an irredundant base for $G$ if the pointwise stabilizer of the sequence is trivial and no point is fixed by the stabilizer of its predecessors. We show that any interval of natural numbers can be realized as the set of cardinalities of irredundant bases for some finite primitive group.</description>

Abstract: We develop a theory of $\times$-homotopy, fundamental groupoids and covering spaces that apply to non-simple graphs, generalizing existing results for simple graphs. We prove that $\times$-homotopies from finite graphs can be decomposed into moves which adjust at most one vertex at a time, generalizing the spider lemma of \cite{CS1}. We define a notion of homotopy covering map and develop a theory of universal covers and deck transformations, generalizing \cites{TardifWroncha, Matsushita} to non-simple graphs. We examine the case of reflexive graphs, where each vertex has at least one loop. We also prove that these homotopy covering maps satisfy a homotopy lifting property for arbitrary graph homomorphisms, generalizing path lifting results of \cites{Matsushita, TardifWroncha}.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Gray codes-an updated survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A combinatorial Gray code for a class of objects is a listing that contains each object from the class exactly once such that any two consecutive objects in the list differ only by a `small change'. Such listings are known for many different combinatorial objects, including bitstrings, combinations, permutations, partitions, triangulations, but also for objects defined with respect to a fixed graph, such as spanning trees, perfect matchings or vertex colorings. This survey provides a comprehensive picture of the state-of-the-art of the research on combinatorial Gray codes. In particular, it gives an update on Savage's influential survey [C. D. Savage. A survey of combinatorial Gray codes. SIAM Rev., 39(4):605--629, 1997.], incorporating many more recent developments. We also emphasize the connections to closely related problems in graph theory, algebra, order theory, geometry and algorithms, which embeds this research area into a broader context. Lastly, we collect and propose a number of challenging research problems, thus stimulating new research endeavors.</description>

      <title>On first-order transductions of classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various aspects of the first-order transduction quasi-order on graph classes, which provides a way of measuring the relative complexity of graph classes based on whether one can encode the other using a formula of first-order (FO) logic. In contrast with the conjectured simplicity of the transduction quasi-order for monadic second-order logic, the FO-transduction quasi-order is very complex, and many standard properties from structural graph theory and model theory naturally appear in it. We prove a local normal form for transductions among other general results and constructions, which we illustrate via several examples and via the characterizations of the transductions of some simple classes. We then turn to various aspects of the quasi-order, including the (non-)existence of minimum and maximum classes for certain properties, the strictness of the pathwidth hierarchy, the fact that the quasi-order is not a lattice, and the role of weakly sparse classes in the quasi-order.</description>

      <title>Structure and coloring of a family of ($P_7, C_5$)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P_t$ and $C_t$ be a path and a cycle on $t$ vertices, respectively. In 2021, Choudum {\em et al.} [Disc. Math. 344 (2021) 112244] determined the structures of $(P_7,C_7,C_4$, diamond)-free and $(P_7,C_7,C_4$, gem)-frees, and gave correspondingly tight upper bounds to the chromatic numbers of these graphs. In this paper, we study the structure of $(P_7, C_5$, kite, paraglider)-free graphs, which is a superfamily of $(P_7, C_5$, diamond)-free graphs. We show that there is a unique connected imperfect $(P_7, C_5$, kite, paraglider)-free graph with $\delta(G)\geq\omega(G)+1$, which has no clique cutsets, no universal cliques, and no pair of vertices of which one's neighborhoods contains the other's. As a consequence, we show that $(P_7, C_5$, kite, paraglider)-free graphs are $\chi$-polydet with a binding function $\omega(G)+1$. Where a {\em diamond} (resp. {\em gem}) consists of a $P_3$ (resp. $P_4$) and a new vertex adjacent to all vertices of the $P_3$ (resp. $P_4$), a {\em kite} consists of a $P_4$ and a new vertex adjacent to consecutive three vertices of the $P_4$, and a {\em paraglider} consists of a $C_4$ and a new vertex adjacent to three vertices of the $C_4$.</description>

      <title>The enriched $q$-monomial basis of the quasisymmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new family $\left( \eta_{\alpha}^{\left( q\right) }\right) _{\alpha\in\operatorname*{Comp}}$ of quasisymmetric functions for each element $q$ of the base ring. We call them the "enriched $q$-monomial quasisymmetric functions". When $r:=q+1$ is invertible, this family is a basis of $\operatorname{QSym}$. It generalizes Hoffman's "essential quasi-symmetric functions" (obtained for $q=0$) and Hsiao's "monomial peak functions" (obtained for $q=1$), but also includes the monomial quasisymmetric functions as a limiting case.
  We describe these functions $\eta_{\alpha}^{\left( q\right) }$ by several formulas, and compute their products, coproducts and antipodes. The product expansion is given by an exotic variant of the shuffle product which we call the "stufufuffle product" due to its ability to pick several consecutive entries from each composition. This "stufufuffle product" has previously appeared in recent work by Bouillot, Novelli and Thibon, generalizing the "block shuffle product" from the theory of multizeta values.</description>

      <title>Foundations of matroids -- Part 2: Further theory, examples, and computational methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this sequel to "Foundations of matroids - Part 1", we establish several presentations of the foundation of a matroid in terms of small building blocks. For example, we show that the foundation of a matroid M is the colimit of the foundations of all embedded minors of M isomorphic to one of the matroids $U^2_4$, $U^2_5$, $U^3_5$, $C_5$, $C_5^\ast$, $U^2_4\oplus U^1_2$, $F_7$, $F_7^\ast$, and we show that this list is minimal. We establish similar minimal lists of building blocks for the classes of 2-connected and 3-connected matroids. We also establish a presentation for the foundation of a matroid in terms of its lattice of flats. Each of these presentations provides a useful method to compute the foundation of certain matroids, as we illustrate with a number of concrete examples. Combining these techniques with other results in the literature, we are able to compute the foundations of several interesting classes of matroids, including whirls, rank-2 uniform matroids, and projective geometries. In an appendix, we catalogue various 'small' pastures which occur as foundations of matroids, most of which were found with the assistance of a computer, and we discuss some of their interesting properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The plethystic Murnaghan-Nakayama rule describes how to decompose the product of a Schur function and a plethysm of the form $p_r\circ h_m$ as a sum of Schur functions. We provide a short, entirely combinatorial proof of this rule using the labelled abaci introduced in Nicholas A. Loehr. Abacus proofs of Schur function identities. In: SIAM J. Discrete Math. 24.4 (2010), pp. 1356-1370.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the avoidance of patterns in inversion sequences that relate sorting via sorting machines including data structures such as pop stacks and stacks. Such machines have been studied under a variety of additional constraints and generalizations, some of which we apply here. We give the classification of several classes of sortable inversion sequences in terms of pattern avoidance. We are able to provide an exact enumeration of some of the sortable classes in question using both classical approaches and a more recent strategy utilizing generating trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersolvable hyperplane arrangements and matroids are known to give rise to certain Koszul algebras, namely their Orlik-Solomon algebras and graded Varchenko-Gel'fand algebras. We explore how this interacts with group actions, particularly for the braid arrangement and the action of the symmetric group, where the Hilbert functions of the algebras and their Koszul duals are given by Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds, respectively. The corresponding symmetric group representations exhibit branching rules that interpret Stirling number recurrences, which are shown to apply to all supersolvable arrangements. They also enjoy representation stability properties that follow from Koszul duality.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing random graphs from distance queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the minimum number of distance queries that is sufficient to reconstruct the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ with constant diameter with high probability. We get a tight (up to a constant factor) answer for all $p&gt;n^{-1+o(1)}$ outside "threshold windows" around $n^{-k/(k+1)+o(1)}$, $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$: with high probability the query complexity equals $\Theta(n^{4-d}p^{2-d})$, where $d$ is the diameter of the random graph. This demonstrates the following non-monotone behaviour: the query complexity jumps down at moments when the diameter gets larger; yet, between these moments the query complexity grows. We also show that there exists a non-adaptive algorithm that reconstructs the random graph with $O(n^{4-d}p^{2-d}\ln n)$ distance queries with high probability, and this is best possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a digraph, an ordering of its vertices defines a backedge graph, namely the undirected graph whose edges correspond to the arcs pointing backwards with respect to the order. The degreewidth of a digraph is the minimum over all ordering of the maximum degree of the backedge graph. We answer an open question by Keeney and Lokshtanov [WG 2024], proving that it is \NP-hard to determine whether an oriented graph has degreewidth at most $1$, which settles the last open case for oriented graphs. We complement this result with a general discussion on parameters defined using backedge graphs and their relations to classical parameters.</description>

      <title>A universal formula for the $x-y$ swap in topological recursion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a recent conjecture of Borot et al. that a particular universal closed algebraic formula recovers the correlation differentials of topological recursion after the swap of $x$ and $y$ in the input data. We also show that this universal formula can be drastically simplified (as it was already done by Hock).
  As an application of this general $x-y$ swap result, we prove an explicit closed formula for the topological recursion differentials for the case of any spectral curve with unramified $y$ and arbitrary rational $x$.</description>

      <title>M\"obius function of the subgroup lattice of a finite group and Euler Characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The M\"obius function of the subgroup lattice of a finite group has been introduced by Hall and applied to investigate several questions. In this paper, we consider the M\"obius function defined on an order ideal related to the lattice of the subgroups of an irreducible subgroup $G$ of the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}(n,q)$ acting on the $n$-dimensional vector space $V=\mathbb{F}_q^n$, where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is the finite field with $q$ elements. We find a relation between this function and the Euler characteristic of two simplicial complexes $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$, the former raising from the lattice of the subspaces of $V$, the latter from the subgroup lattice of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the representation theory of the Ariki-Koike algebra, a $q$-deformation of the group algebra of the complex reflection group $C_r \wr S_n$. We define the addition of a runner full of beads for the abacus display of a multipartition and investigate some combinatorial properties of this operation. We focus our attention on the $q$-decomposition numbers, i.e. the polynomials arising from the Fock space representation of the quantum group $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_e)$. Using Fayers' LLT-type algorithm for Ariki-Koike algebras, we relate $q$-decomposition numbers for different values of $e$ for the class of $e$-multiregular multipartitions, by adding a full runner of beads to each component of the abacus displays for the labelling multipartitions.</description>

      <title>On diagonal digraphs, Koszul algebras and triangulations of homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is devoted to the study of diagonal digraphs, i.e. digraphs whose magnitude homology is concentrated on the diagonal. For a digraph $G$ and $\ell\geq 2,$ we describe a condition, denoted by $(\mathcal{V}_\ell)$, equivalent to vanishing of the second magnitude homology group ${\rm MH}_{2,k}(G,\mathbb{Z})$ for all $k&gt;\ell.$ In particular, diagonal digraphs satisfy $(\mathcal{V}_2).$ As a corollary we obtain that the 2-dimensional CW-complex obtained from a diagonal undirected graph by attaching 2-cells to all squares and triangles of the graph is simply connected. We also give an interpretation of diagonality in terms of Koszul algebras: a digraph $G$ is diagonal if and only if the distance algebra $\sigma G$ is Koszul for any ground field; and if and only if $G$ satisfies $(\mathcal{V}_2)$ and the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is Koszul for any ground field. To obtain a source of examples of digraphs, we study the extended Hasse diagram $\hat G_K$ of a pure simplicial complex $K$. For a triangulation $K$ of a topological manifold $M,$ we express the non-diagonal part of the magnitude homology of $\hat G_K$ via the homology of $M$. As a corollary we obtain that, if $K$ is a triangulation of a closed manifold $M$, then $\hat G_K$ is diagonal if and only if $M$ is a homology sphere.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of the Rips complexes of Integer lattices via local domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each positive integer $n$, the Rips complexes of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice in the $d_1$ metric (i.e., the Manhattan metric, also called the natural word metric in the Cayley graph) are contractible at scales above $n^2(2n-1)$, with the bounds arising from the Jung's constants. We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension $n$ and a fixed scale $r$, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for $n=1,2,3$, the Rips complex of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to $n$ is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions $n$</description>

      <title>Singular loci of Schubert varieties and the Lookup Conjecture in type $\tilde A_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the loci of non-rationally smooth (nrs) points and of singular points for any non-spiral Schubert variety of $\tilde{A}_2$ in terms of the geometry of the (affine) Weyl group action on the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. Together with the results of Graham and Li for spiral elements, this allows us to explicitly identify the maximal singular and nrs points in any Schubert variety of type $\tilde{A}_2$. Comparable results are not known for any other infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody flag variety (except for type $\tilde{A}_1$, where every Schubert variety is rationally smooth). As a consequence, we deduce that if $x$ is a point in a non-spiral Schubert variety $X_w$, then $x$ is nrs in $X_w$ if and only if there are more than $\dim X_w$ curves in $X_w$ through $x$ which are stable under the action of a maximal torus, as is true for Schubert varieties in (finite) type $A$. Combined with the work of Graham and Li for spiral Schubert varieties, this implies the Lookup Conjecture for $\tilde{A}_2$.</description>
