      <title>Not All Factors Crowd Equally: Modeling, Measuring, and Trading on Alpha Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a specific functional form for factor alpha decay -- hyperbolic decay alpha(t) = K/(1+lambda*t) -- from a game-theoretic equilibrium model, and test it against linear and exponential alternatives. Using eight Fama-French factors (1963--2024), we find: (1) Hyperbolic decay fits mechanical factors. Momentum exhibits clear hyperbolic decay (R^2 = 0.65), outperforming linear (0.51) and exponential (0.61) baselines -- validating the equilibrium foundation. (2) Not all factors crowd equally. Mechanical factors (momentum, reversal) fit the model; judgment-based factors (value, quality) do not -- consistent with a signal-ambiguity taxonomy paralleling Hua and Sun's "barriers to entry." (3) Crowding accelerated post-2015. Out-of-sample, the model over-predicts remaining alpha (0.30 vs. 0.15), correlating with factor ETF growth (rho = -0.63). (4) Average returns are efficiently priced. Crowding-based factor selection fails to generate alpha (Sharpe: 0.22 vs. 0.39 factor momentum benchmark). (5) Crowding predicts tail risk. Out-of-sample (2001--2024), crowded reversal factors show 1.7--1.8x higher crash probability (bottom decile returns), while crowded momentum shows lower crash risk (0.38x, p = 0.006). Our findings extend equilibrium crowding models (DeMiguel et al.) to temporal dynamics and show that crowding predicts crashes, not means -- useful for risk management, not alpha generation.</description>

      <title>Deep Hedging with Reinforcement Learning: A Practical Framework for Option Risk Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reinforcement-learning (RL) framework for dynamic hedging of equity index option exposures under realistic transaction costs and position limits. We hedge a normalized option-implied equity exposure (one unit of underlying delta, offset via SPY) by trading the underlying index ETF, using the option surface and macro variables only as state information and not as a direct pricing engine. Building on the "deep hedging" paradigm of Buehler et al. (2019), we design a leak-free environment, a cost-aware reward function, and a lightweight stochastic actor-critic agent trained on daily end-of-day panel data constructed from SPX/SPY implied volatility term structure, skew, realized volatility, and macro rate context. On a fixed train/validation/test split, the learned policy improves risk-adjusted performance versus no-hedge, momentum, and volatility-targeting baselines (higher point-estimate Sharpe); only the GAE policy's test-sample Sharpe is statistically distinguishable from zero, although confidence intervals overlap with a long-SPY benchmark so we stop short of claiming formal dominance. Turnover remains controlled and the policy is robust to doubled transaction costs. The modular codebase, comprising a data pipeline, simulator, and training scripts, is engineered for extensibility to multi-asset overlays, alternative objectives (e.g., drawdown or CVaR), and intraday data. From a portfolio management perspective, the learned overlay is designed to sit on top of an existing SPX or SPY allocation, improving the portfolio's mean-variance trade-off with controlled turnover and drawdowns. We discuss practical implications for portfolio overlays and outline avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volatility Modelling with LSTM Networks: A Hybrid Approach for S&amp;P 500 Index Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate volatility forecasting is essential in banking, investment, and risk management, because expectations about future market movements directly influence current decisions. This study proposes a hybrid modelling framework that integrates a Stochastic Volatility model with a Long Short Term Memory neural network. The SV model improves statistical precision and captures latent volatility dynamics, especially in response to unforeseen events, while the LSTM network enhances the model's ability to detect complex nonlinear patterns in financial time series. The forecasting is conducted using daily data from the S and P 500 index, covering the period from January 1 1998 to December 31 2024. A rolling window approach is employed to train the model and generate one step ahead volatility forecasts. The performance of the hybrid SV-LSTM model is evaluated through both statistical testing and investment simulations. The results show that the hybrid approach outperforms both the standalone SV and LSTM models and contributes to the development of volatility modelling techniques, providing a foundation for improving risk assessment and strategic investment planning in the context of the S and P 500.</description>

      <title>Strict universality of the square-root law in price impact across stocks: a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models (Nature 2003, QJE 2006, and Quant. Finance 2013). Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>

      <title>Technical Indicator Networks (TINs): An Interpretable Neural Architecture Modernizing Classic al Technical Analysis for Adaptive Algorithmic Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have transformed fields such as computer vision and natural language processing by employing architectures aligned with domain-specific structural patterns. In algorithmic trading, however, there remains a lack of architectures that directly incorporate the logic of traditional technical indicators. This study introduces Technical Indicator Networks (TINs), a structured neural design that reformulates rule-based financial heuristics into trainable and interpretable modules. The architecture preserves the core mathematical definitions of conventional indicators while extending them to multidimensional data and supporting optimization through diverse learning paradigms, including reinforcement learning. Analytical transformations such as averaging, clipping, and ratio computation are expressed as vectorized layer operators, enabling transparent network construction and principled initialization. This formulation retains the clarity and interpretability of classical strategies while allowing adaptive adjustment and data-driven refinement. As a proof of concept, the framework is validated on the Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents using a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) TIN. Empirical results demonstrate improved risk-adjusted performance relative to traditional indicator-based strategies. Overall, the findings suggest that TINs provide a generalizable foundation for interpretable, adaptive, and extensible learning architectures in structured decision-making domains and indicate substantial commercial potential for upgrading trading platforms with cross-market visibility and enhanced decision-support capabilities.</description>
