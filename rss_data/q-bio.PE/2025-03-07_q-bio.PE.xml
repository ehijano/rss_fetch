      <title>Assessing the performance of compartmental and renewal models for learning $R_{t}$ using spatially heterogeneous epidemic simulations on real geographies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-varying reproduction number ($R_t$) gives an indication of the trajectory of an infectious disease outbreak. Commonly used frameworks for inferring $R_t$ from epidemiological time series include those based on compartmental models (such as the SEIR model) and renewal equation models. These inference methods are usually validated using synthetic data generated from a simple model, often from the same class of model as the inference framework. However, in a real outbreak the transmission processes, and thus the infection data collected, are much more complex. The performance of common $R_t$ inference methods on data with similar complexity to real world scenarios has been subject to less comprehensive validation. We therefore propose evaluating these inference methods on outbreak data generated from a sophisticated, geographically accurate agent-based model. We illustrate this proposed method by generating synthetic data for two outbreaks in Northern Ireland: one with minimal spatial heterogeneity, and one with additional heterogeneity. We find that the simple SEIR model struggles with the greater heterogeneity, while the renewal equation model demonstrates greater robustness to spatial heterogeneity, though is sensitive to the accuracy of the generation time distribution used in inference. Our approach represents a principled way to benchmark epidemiological inference tools and is built upon an open-source software platform for reproducible epidemic simulation and inference.</description>

      <title>BIOSCAN-5M: A Multimodal Dataset for Insect Biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12723v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of an ongoing worldwide effort to comprehend and monitor insect biodiversity, this paper presents the BIOSCAN-5M Insect dataset to the machine learning community and establish several benchmark tasks. BIOSCAN-5M is a comprehensive dataset containing multi-modal information for over 5 million insect specimens, and it significantly expands existing image-based biological datasets by including taxonomic labels, raw nucleotide barcode sequences, assigned barcode index numbers, geographical, and size information. We propose three benchmark experiments to demonstrate the impact of the multi-modal data types on the classification and clustering accuracy. First, we pretrain a masked language model on the DNA barcode sequences of the BIOSCAN-5M dataset, and demonstrate the impact of using this large reference library on species- and genus-level classification performance. Second, we propose a zero-shot transfer learning task applied to images and DNA barcodes to cluster feature embeddings obtained from self-supervised learning, to investigate whether meaningful clusters can be derived from these representation embeddings. Third, we benchmark multi-modality by performing contrastive learning on DNA barcodes, image data, and taxonomic information. This yields a general shared embedding space enabling taxonomic classification using multiple types of information and modalities. The code repository of the BIOSCAN-5M Insect dataset is available at https://github.com/bioscan-ml/BIOSCAN-5M.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Organization in Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems are thermodynamically open but closed in their organization. In other words, even though their material components turn over constantly, a material-independent property persists, which we call organization. Moreover, organization comes from within organisms themselves, which requires us to explain how this self-organization is established and maintained. In this paper we propose a mathematical and conceptual framework to understand the kinds of organized systems that living systems are, aiming to explain how self-organization emerges from more basic elemental processes. Additionally, we map our own notions to existing traditions in theoretical biology and philosophy, aiming to bring the main formal ideas into conceptual congruence.</description>

      <title>The nexus between disease surveillance, adaptive human behavior and epidemic containment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemics exhibit interconnected processes that operate at multiple time and organizational scales, a hallmark of complex adaptive systems. Modern epidemiological modeling frameworks incorporate feedback between individual-level behavioral choices and centralized interventions. Nonetheless, the realistic operational course for disease detection, planning, and response is often overlooked. Disease detection is a dynamic challenge, shaped by the interplay between surveillance efforts and transmission characteristics. It serves as a tipping point that triggers emergency declarations, information dissemination, adaptive behavioral responses, and the deployment of public health interventions. Evaluating the impact of disease surveillance systems as triggers for adaptive behavior and public health interventions is key to designing effective control policies.
  We examine the multiple behavioral and epidemiological dynamics generated by the feedback between disease surveillance and the intertwined dynamics of information and disease propagation. Specifically, we study the intertwined dynamics between: $(i)$ disease surveillance triggering health emergency declarations, $(ii)$ risk information dissemination producing decentralized behavioral responses, and $(iii)$ centralized interventions. Our results show that robust surveillance systems that quickly detect a disease outbreak can trigger an early response from the population, leading to large epidemic sizes. The key result is that the response scenarios that minimize the final epidemic size are determined by the trade-off between the risk information dissemination and disease transmission, with the triggering effect of surveillance mediating this trade-off. Finally, our results confirm that behavioral adaptation can create a hysteresis-like effect on the final epidemic size.</description>

      <title>Social Imitation Dynamics of Vaccination Driven by Vaccine Effectiveness and Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Declines in vaccination coverage for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, have enabled their surprising comebacks and pose significant public health challenges in the wake of growing vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine opt-outs and refusals are often fueled by beliefs concerning perceptions of vaccine effectiveness and exaggerated risks. Here, we quantify the impact of competing beliefs -- vaccine-averse versus vaccine-neutral -- on social imitation dynamics of vaccination, alongside the epidemiological dynamics of disease transmission. These beliefs may be pre-existing and fixed, or coevolving attitudes. This interplay among beliefs, behaviors, and disease dynamics demonstrates that individuals are not perfectly rational; rather, they base their vaccine uptake decisions on beliefs, personal experiences, and social influences. We find that the presence of a small proportion of fixed vaccine-averse beliefs can significantly exacerbate the vaccination dilemma, making the tipping point in the hysteresis loop more sensitive to changes in individuals' perceived costs of vaccination and vaccine effectiveness. However, in scenarios where competing beliefs spread concurrently with vaccination behavior, their double-edged impact can lead to self-correction and alignment between vaccine beliefs and behaviors. The results show that coevolution of vaccine beliefs and behaviors makes populations more sensitive to abrupt changes in perceptions of vaccine cost and effectiveness compared to scenarios without beliefs. Our work provides valuable insights into harnessing the social contagion of even vaccine-neutral attitudes to overcome vaccine hesitancy.</description>
