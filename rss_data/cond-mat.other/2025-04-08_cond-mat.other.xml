      <title>Local-density correlation functional from the force-balance equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The force-balance equation of time-dependent density-functional theory presents a promising route towards obtaining approximate functionals, however, so far, no practical correlation functionals have been derived this way. In this work, starting from a correlated wavefunction proposed originally by Colle and Salvetti [Theoret. Chim. Acta 37, 329 (1975)], we derive an analytical correlation-energy functional for the ground state based on the force-balance equation. The new functional is compared to the local-density correlation of the homogeneous electron gas and we find an increased performance for atomic systems, while it performs slightly worse on solids. From this point onward, the new force-based correlation functional can be systematically improved.</description>

      <title>Observing the Glass and Jamming Transitions of Dense Granular Material in Microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates a weakly pulsed granular system of polystyrene spheres under long-time microgravity conditions on the International Space Station (ISS). The spheres are measured using Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) and are described by mean square displacements (MSDs). Our aim is to use this technique to show the first experimental evidence of glassy dynamics in dense granular media in microgravity and subsequently compare these results with ground-based measurements to see how the nature of these dynamics change without the influence of gravity. Our results show that as we densify the sample in microgravity, glassy dynamics appear at a volume fraction 1.6\% lower than on ground. We also show how the influence of gravity can affect how dense a granular system one can prepare by comparing the final jamming point of our sample on the ISS compared to our ground setup. We show that jamming occurs at a volume fraction 0.5\% lower in space compared to on ground. Showing that we can create denser states when a granular system is in the presence of a stronger gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Capturing AI's Attention: Physics of Repetition, Hallucination, Bias and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a first-principles physics theory of the AI engine at the heart of LLMs' 'magic' (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude): the basic Attention head. The theory allows a quantitative analysis of outstanding AI challenges such as output repetition, hallucination and harmful content, and bias (e.g. from training and fine-tuning). Its predictions are consistent with large-scale LLM outputs. Its 2-body form suggests why LLMs work so well, but hints that a generalized 3-body Attention would make such AI work even better. Its similarity to a spin-bath means that existing Physics expertise could immediately be harnessed to help Society ensure AI is trustworthy and resilient to manipulation.</description>

      <title>How to build transfer matrices, one wave at a time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to build the closed-form expression of transfer matrices for wave propagation in layered media. The key is to represent the propagation across the piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths ($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a certain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each individual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of transmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique is combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in frequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the finite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their associated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths to find the final result. Beyond providing physical insight, this ``path-by-path'' construction can also circumvent the need for transfer matrix numerical multiplication in many practical applications, potentially enabling substantial computational savings.</description>

      <title>Deformation of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra and the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}\left( {1|2} \right)$: exact solution for the quantum harmonic oscillator with a position-dependent mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new deformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator Heisenberg-Weyl algebra with a parameter $a&gt;-1$. This parameter is introduced through the replacement of the homogeneous mass $m_0$ in the definition of the momentum operator $\hat p_x$ as well as in the creation-annihilation operators $\hat a^\pm$ with a mass varying with position $x$. The realization of such a deformation is shown through the exact solution of the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation for the non-relativistic quantum harmonic oscillator within the canonical approach. The obtained analytical expression of the energy spectrum consists of an infinite number of equidistant levels, whereas the wavefunctions of the stationary states of the problem under construction are expressed through the Hermite polynomials. Then, the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra deformation is generalized to the case of the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}\left( {1|2} \right)$. It is shown that the realization of such a generalized superalgebra can be performed for the parabose quantum harmonic oscillator problem, the mass of which possesses a behavior completely overlapping with the position-dependent mass of the canonically deformed harmonic oscillator problem. This problem is solved exactly for both even and odd stationary states. It is shown that the energy spectrum of the deformed parabose oscillator is still equidistant, however, both even and odd state wavefunctions are now expressed through the Laguerre polynomials. Some basic limit relations recovering the canonical harmonic oscillator with constant mass are also discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>Topological transition between gapless phases in quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological gapless phases of matter have been a recent interest among theoretical and experimental condensed matter physicists. Fermionic chains with extended nearest neighbor couplings have been observed to show unique topological transition at the multicritical points between distinct gapless phases. In this work, we show that such topological gapless phases and the transition between them can be simulated in a quantum walk. We consider a three-step discrete-time quantum walk and identify various critical or gapless phases and multicriticalities from the topological phase diagram along with their distinguished energy dispersions. We reconstruct the scaling theory based on the curvature function to study transition between gapless phases in the quantum walk. We show the interesting features observed in fermionic chains, such as diverging, sign flipping and swapping properties of curvature function, can be simulated in the quantum walk. Moreover, the renormalization group flow and Wannier state correlation functions also identify transition at the multicritical points between gapless phases. We observe the scaling law and overlapping of critical and fixed point properties at the multicritical points of the fermionic chains can also be observed in the quantum walk. Furthermore, we categorize the topological transitions at various multicritical points using the group velocity of the energy eigenstates. Finally, the topological characters of various gapless phases are captured using winding number which allows one to distinguish various gapless phases and also show the transitions at the multicritical points.</description>

      <title>Controlled-squeeze gate in superconducting quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to prepare non-classical states of the electromagnetic field in a microwave resonator. It is based on a controlled gate that applies a squeezing operation on a SQUID-terminated resonator conditioned on the state of a dispersively coupled qubit. This controlled-squeeze gate, when combined with Gaussian operations on the resonator, is universal. We explore the use of this tool to map an arbitrary qubit state into a superposition of squeezed states. In particular, we target a bosonic code with well-defined superparity which makes photon losses detectable by non-demolition parity measurements. We analyze the possibility of implementing this using state-of-the-art circuit QED tools and conclude that it is within reach of current technologies.</description>

      <title>Sub-micron Circuit Fabrication on Diamond Anvils for Mesoscopic High-Pressure Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel fabrication procedure to produce high-quality lift-off structures on diamond anvils extending from the culet down to the slanted facets. Feature sizes down to 500 nm are achieved through the use of a bi-layer resist stack and electron beam lithography. Device structures with strong adhesion to the diamond surface and high abrasion resistance are realized by optimizing the surface treatment. To benchmark our process, we fabricate a multi-lead tungsten circuit to measure changes of the superconducting transition temperature of zirconium across the structural phase transition at $\sim$30 GPa; showing a 4-fold jump of the critical temperature. Our process is easily reproducible in most traditional academic and industrial cleanroom facilities. This work paves the way for complex and high-precision fabrication and measurements inside diamond anvil cells and on other faceted crystalline samples.</description>
