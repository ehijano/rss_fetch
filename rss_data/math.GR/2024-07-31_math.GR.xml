      <title>$GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$-analogues of some properties of $n$-cycles in $\mathfrak{S}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give analogues in the finite general linear group of two elementary results concerning long cycles and transpositions in the symmetric group: first, that the long cycles are precisely the elements whose minimum-length factorizations into transpositions yield a generating set, and second, that a long cycle together with an appropriate transposition generates the whole symmetric group.</description>

      <title>Fixed point ratios, Sylow numbers and coverings of $p$-elements in finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed point ratios for primitive permutation groups have been extensively studied. Relying on a recent work of Burness and Guralnick, we obtain further results in the area. For a prime $p$ and a finite group $G$, we use fixed point ratios to study the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ and the minimal size of a covering by proper subgroups of the set of $p$-elements of $G$.</description>

      <title>Semialgebraic groups and generalized affine buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of algebraic groups over real closed fields and apply the results to construct a geometric object $\mathcal{B}$ and to prove that $\mathcal{B}$ is an affine $\Lambda$-building. We use a model theoretic transfer principle to prove generalizations of statements about semisimple Lie groups. In this direction we give proofs for the Iwasawa-decomposition $KAU$, the Cartan-decomposition $KAK$ and the Bruhat-decomposition $BWB$. For unipotent subgroups we prove the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and use it to analyse root groups. We give a proof of the Jacobson-Morozov Lemma about subgroups whose Lie algebra is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and we describe other rank 1 subgroups which are the semisimple parts of Levi-subgroups. We prove a semialgebraic version of Kostant's convexity.
  Over the reals, semisimple Lie groups are closely related to the symmetry groups of symmetric spaces of non-compact type. These symmetric spaces can be described semialgebraically, which allows us to consider their semialgebraic extension over any real closed field. Starting from these non-standard symmetric spaces we use a valuation (with image some non-discrete ordered abelian group $\Lambda$) on the fields to define a $\Lambda$-pseudometric. Identifying points of distance zero results in a $\Lambda$-metric space $\mathcal{B}$. Assuming that the root system of the associated Lie group is reduced, we prove that $\mathcal{B}$ is an affine $\Lambda$-building. The proof relies on a thorough analysis of stabilizers.</description>

      <title>Burau representation of $B_4$ and quantization of the rational projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The braid group $B_4$ naturally acts on the rational projective plane $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{Q})$, this action corresponds to the classical integral reduced Burau representation of $B_4$. The first result of this paper is a classification of the orbits of this action. The Burau representation then defines an action of $B_4$ on $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{Z}(q))$, where $q$ is a formal parameter and $\mathbb{Z}(q)$ is the field of rational functions in $q$ with integer coefficients. We study orbits of the $B_4$-action on $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{Z}(q))$, and show existence of embeddings of the $q$-deformed projective line $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{Z}(q))$ that precisely correspond to the notion of $q$-rationals due to Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko.</description>

      <title>Cardinalities of irredundant bases of finite primitive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite permutation group acting on a set $\Omega$. An ordered sequence $(\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_\ell)$ of elements of $\Omega$ is an irredundant base for $G$ if the pointwise stabilizer of the sequence is trivial and no point is fixed by the stabilizer of its predecessors. We show that any interval of natural numbers can be realized as the set of cardinalities of irredundant bases for some finite primitive group.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem on CAT(0) spaces with contracting isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with a non-elementary action on a proper CAT(0) space $X$, and let $\mu$ be a measure on $G$ such that the random walk $(Z_n)_n$ generated by $\mu$ has finite second moment on $X$. Let $o$ be a basepoint in $X$, and assume that there exists a rank one isometry in $G$. We prove that in this context, $(Z_n o )_n$ satisfies a Central Limit Theorem, namely that the random variables $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(d(Z_n o, o) - n \lambda) $ converge in law to a non-degenerate Gaussian distribution $N_\mu$, for $\lambda$ the (positive) drift of the random walk. The strategy relies on the use of hyperbolic models introduced by H. Petyt, A. Zalloum and D. Spriano, which are analogues of curve graphs and cubical hyperplanes for the class of CAT(0) spaces. As a side result, we prove that the probability that the nth-step $Z_n$ acts on $X$ as a contracting isometry goes to 1 as $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>M\"obius function of the subgroup lattice of a finite group and Euler Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The M\"obius function of the subgroup lattice of a finite group has been introduced by Hall and applied to investigate several questions. In this paper, we consider the M\"obius function defined on an order ideal related to the lattice of the subgroups of an irreducible subgroup $G$ of the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}(n,q)$ acting on the $n$-dimensional vector space $V=\mathbb{F}_q^n$, where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is the finite field with $q$ elements. We find a relation between this function and the Euler characteristic of two simplicial complexes $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$, the former raising from the lattice of the subspaces of $V$, the latter from the subgroup lattice of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $H$ is a Hall subgroup of a finite group $G$, it was proven in 1989 using the classification of finite simple groups that all the irreducible complex characters of $H$ extend to $G$ if and only if there is $N\trianglelefteq G$ such that $HN=G$ and $H\cap N=1$. In this note we offer a modular version of this result under more general hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Convex co-compact groups with one dimensional boundary faces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.05056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider convex co-compact subgroups of the projective linear group. We prove that such a group is relatively hyperbolic with respect to a collection of virtually Abelian subgroups of rank two if and only if each open face in the ideal boundary has dimension at most one. We also introduce the "coarse Hilbert dimension" of a subset of a convex set and use it to characterize when a naive convex co-compact subgroup is word hyperbolic or relatively hyperbolic with respect to a collection of virtually Abelian subgroups of rank two.</description>

      <title>$G$-complete reducibility and saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H \subseteq G$ be connected reductive linear algebraic groups defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt; 0$. In our first main theorem we show that if a closed subgroup $K$ of $H$ is $H$-completely reducible, then it is also $G$-completely reducible in the sense of Serre, under some restrictions on $p$, generalising the known case for $G = GL(V)$. Our proof uses R.W. Richardson's notion of reductive pairs to reduce to the $GL(V)$ case. We study Serre's notion of saturation and prove that saturation behaves well with respect to products and regular subgroups. Our second main theorem shows that if $K$ is $H$-completely reducible, then the saturation of $K$ in $G$ is completely reducible in the saturation of $H$ in $G$ (which is again a connected reductive subgroup of $G$), under suitable restrictions on $p$, again generalising the known instance for $G = GL(V)$. We also study saturation of finite subgroups of Lie type in $G$. We show that saturation is compatible with standard Frobenius endomorphisms, and we use this to generalise a result due to Nori from 1987 in case $G = GL(V)$.</description>

      <title>Computing the unit group of a commutative finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a commutative finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra, i.e., for a commutative ring $R$ whose additive group is finitely generated, it is known that the group of units of $R$ is finitely generated, as well. Our main results are algorithms to compute generators and the structure of this group. This is achieved by reducing the task first to the case of reduced rings, then to torsion-free reduced rings, and finally to an order in a reduced ring. The simplified cases are treated via a calculation of exponent lattices and various algorithms to compute the minimal primes, primitive idempotents, and other basic objects. All algorithms have been implemented and are available as a SageMath package. Whenever possible, the time complexity of the described methods is tracked carefully.</description>
