      <title>Natural fumigation as a mechanism for volatile transport between flower organs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plants synthesize volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to attract pollinators and beneficial microorganisms, to defend themselves against herbivores and pathogens and for plant-plant communication. Generally, accumulation and emission of VOCs occur from the tissue of their biosynthesis. However, using biochemical and reverse genetic approaches, we demonstrate a new physiological phenomenon: inter-organ aerial transport of VOCs via natural fumigation.&lt;p&gt;Before petunia flowers open, a tube-specific terpene synthase produces sesquiterpenes, which are released inside the buds and then accumulate in the stigma, potentially defending the developing stigma from pathogens. These VOCs also affect reproductive organ development and seed yield, which is a previously unknown function for terpenoid compounds. could serve as a mechanism to coordinate the timing of pistil development with petal development in order to insure that the stigma is receptive when the flowers are most likely to attract pollinators. Further studies are required to assess whether natural fumigation is conserved in flowering plants, to uncover the mechanisms involved, and to determine its evolutionary advantage in plant reproduction.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Message Passing for Glycan Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glycans are the most complex biological sequence, with monosaccharides forming extended, non-linear sequences. As post-translational modifications, they modulate protein structure, function, and interactions. Due to their diversity and complexity, predictive models of glycan properties and functions are still insufficient. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep learning models designed to process and analyze graph-structured data. These architectures leverage the connectivity and relational information in graphs to learn effective representations of nodes, edges, and entire graphs. Iteratively aggregating information from neighboring nodes, GNNs capture complex patterns within graph data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks such as link prediction or graph classification across domains. This work presents a new model architecture based on combinatorial complexes and higher-order message passing to extract features from glycan structures into a latent space representation. The architecture is evaluated on an improved GlycanML benchmark suite, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. We envision that these improvements will spur further advances in computational glycosciences and reveal the roles of glycans in biology.</description>

      <title>Geometric Self-Supervised Pretraining on 3D Protein Structures using Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein representation learning aims to learn informative protein embeddings capable of addressing crucial biological questions, such as protein function prediction. Although sequence-based transformer models have shown promising results by leveraging the vast amount of protein sequence data in a self-supervised way, there is still a gap in exploiting the available 3D protein structures. In this work, we propose a pre-training scheme going beyond trivial masking methods leveraging 3D and hierarchical structures of proteins. We propose a novel self-supervised method to pretrain 3D graph neural networks on 3D protein structures, by predicting the distances between local geometric centroids of protein subgraphs and the global geometric centroid of the protein. By considering subgraphs and their relationships to the global protein structure, our model can better learn the geometric properties of the protein structure. We experimentally show that our proposed pertaining strategy leads to significant improvements up to 6\%, in the performance of 3D GNNs in various protein classification tasks. Our work opens new possibilities in unsupervised learning for protein graph models while eliminating the need for multiple views, augmentations, or masking strategies which are currently used so far.</description>
