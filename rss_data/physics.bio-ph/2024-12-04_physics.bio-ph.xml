      <title>Strong localization blurs criticality of time series for spreading phenomena on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze critical time series of the order parameter generated with active to inactive phase transitions of spreading dynamics running on the top of heterogeneous networks. Different activation mechanisms that govern the dynamics near the critical point were investigated. The time series were analyzed using the visibility graph (VG) method where a disassortative degree correlation of the VG is a signature of criticality. In contrast, assortative correlation is associated with offcritical dynamics. The signature of criticality given by the VG is confirmed for collective activation phenomena, as in the case of homogeneous networks. Similarly, for a localized activation driven by a densely connected set of hubs, identified by a maximum k-core decomposition, critical times series were also successfully identified by the VG method. However, in the case of activation driven by sparsely distributed hubs, the time series criticality is blurred, being observable only for huge systems. In the case of strong structural localization induced by the presence of rare regions, an assortative VG degree correlation, typical of off-critical series, is observed. We conclude that while macroscopic times series remain good proxies for the analysis of criticality for collective or maximum k-core activation, systems under spatial localization can postpone the signatures of or, in case of extreme localization, lead to false negatives for criticality of time series.</description>

      <title>Social patch foraging theory in an egalitarian group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02381v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foraging is a widespread behavior, and being part of a group may bring several benefits compared to solitary foraging, such as collective pooling of information and reducing environmental uncertainty. Often theoretical models of collective behavior use coarse-grained representations, or are too complex for analytical treatment, and generally do not take into account the noisy decision making process implemented by individual agents. This calls for the development of a mechanistic, analytically tractable, and stochastic framework to study the underlying processes of social foraging, tying the microscopic to the macroscopic levels. Based on an evidence accumulation framework, we developed a model of patch-leaving decisions in a large egalitarian group. Across a variety of environmental statistics and information sharing mechanisms, we were able to analytically derive optimal agent strategies. The environmental statistics considered are either two non-depleting or several successive depleting patches. The social information sharing mechanisms are either through observation of others' food rewards or through belief sharing, with continuous sharing, pulsatile observation of others' departures or arrivals, or through counting the number of individuals in a patch. Throughout all these conditions, we quantified how cohesive a group is over time, how much time agents spend on average in a patch and what are their group equilibrium dynamics. We found that social coupling strongly modulates these features across a variety of environmental statistics. This general modeling framework is crucial to both designing social foraging experiments and generating hypotheses that can be tested. Moreover, this framework can be extended to groups exhibiting hierarchical relations.</description>

      <title>Cargo Delivery to Cells Using Laser-Irradiated Carbon-Black-Loaded PDMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective intracellular delivery is essential for successful gene editing of cells. Spatially selective delivery to cells that is simultaneously precise, consistent, and non-destructive remains challenging using conventional state-of-the-art techniques. Here, we introduce a carrier-free method for spatiotemporal delivery of fluorescently labeled cargo into both adherent and suspension cells using carbon-black-embedded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates irradiated by nanosecond laser pulses. This low-cost, biocompatible material, coupled with an optical approach, enables scalable, spatially selective, and sequential delivery of multiple cargo molecules, including FITC-dextran and siRNA, to a broad range of cells. Notably, we achieved siRNA delivery into the cytoplasm of hard-to-transfect K562 cells with 45% efficiency, while maintaining nearly 100% cell viability.</description>

      <title>A unified-field theory of genome organization and gene regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our aim is to predict how often genic and non-genic promoters fire within a cell. We first review a parsimonious pan-genomic model for genome organization and gene regulation, where transcription rate is determined by proximity in 3D space of promoters to clusters containing appropriate factors and RNA polymerases -- structures variously called transcription factories, hubs, and condensates. This model allows reconciliation of conflicting results indicating that regulatory mammalian networks are both simple (as over-expressing just 4 transcription factors switches cell state) and complex (as genome-wide association studies show phenotypes like cell type are determined by thousands of loci rarely encoding such factors). It also yields simple explanations of how mysterious motifs like quantitative trait loci, enhancers, and silencers work. We then present 3D polymer simulations, and a proximity formula based on our biological model that enables prediction of transcriptional activities of all promoters in three human cell types. This simple fitting-free formula contains just one variable (distance on the genetic map to the nearest active promoter), and we suggest it can be applied to any organism.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a dynamical state of coherent bursting with power-law distributed avalanches from collective stochastic dynamics of adaptive neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous brain activity in the absence of external stimuli is not random but contains complex dynamical structures such as neuronal avalanches with power-law duration and size distributions. These experimental observations have been interpreted as supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the brain is operating near a critical point of phase transition between two states, and attracted much attention. Here, we show that a dynamical state of coherent bursting, with power-law distributed avalanches and features as observed in experiments, emerges in networks of adaptive neurons with stochastic input when excitation is sufficiently strong and balanced by adaptation. We demonstrate that these power-law distributed avalanches are direct consequences of stochasticity and coherent bursting, which in turn is the result of a balance between excitation and adaptation. Our work thus shows that the observed dynamical features of neuronal avalanches can arise from collective stochastic dynamics of adaptive neurons under suitable conditions and need not be signatures of criticality.</description>

      <title>Intermittent turbulent gusts lift eagles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence grounds aircraft and combating it in flight requires energy, yet volant wildlife fly effortlessly even on windy days. The nature of the interactions between soaring birds and transient turbulent gusts is not clear, especially when compared with our understanding of flight in larger and steadier airflows during thermal or dynamic soaring. We show that soaring golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) experienced short upward accelerations indicative of preferential engagement with strong and intermittent turbulent updrafts. The vertical accelerations reflect changes in lift that were as large as 25 standard deviations from the mean, or more than three times the acceleration of gravity, and so large as not to be consistent with gust mitigation or avoidance. These extreme events occurred in short bursts that mimic movement with turbulent vortices. The burst statistics and their symmetries approach those of turbulence toward longer timescales. On the shortest timescales, the bursts break the symmetry of small-scale turbulence in favor of upward accelerations that are more intermittent than turbulence. We introduce a simple nonlinear model that predicts the scale at which symmetry breaks and the stronger intermittency on the smaller scales. These findings suggest a ratcheting mechanism on turbulent gusts and constitute the first quantitative evidence in favor of turbulent gust harvesting by wildlife. An implication is that turbulence is so strong and pervasive as to make unsteady and nonlinear aerodynamics an intrinsic and beneficial aspect of both flapping and soaring flight in the atmospheric boundary layer - one that we need to incorporate in our understanding of the energetics of flight.</description>

      <title>Time-Heterogeneity of the F\"orster Radius from Dipole Orientational Dynamics Impacts Single-Molecule FRET Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon involving the non-radiative transfer of energy between coupled electric dipoles. Due to the strong dependence of FRET on the distance between the dipoles, it is frequently used as a ``molecular ruler" in biology, chemistry, and physics. This is done by placing dipolar molecules called dyes on molecules of interest. In time-resolved confocal single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments, the joint distribution of the FRET efficiency and the donor fluorescence lifetime can reveal underlying molecular conformational dynamics via deviation from their theoretical F\"orster relationship. This deviation is referred to as a dynamic shift. Quantifying the dynamic shift caused by the motion of the fluorescent dyes is essential to decoupling the dynamics of the studied molecules and the dyes. We develop novel Langevin models for the dye linker dynamics, including rotational dynamics, based on first principle physics and proper dye linker chemistry to match accessible volumes predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. By simulating the dyes' stochastic translational and rotational dynamics, we show that the observed dynamic shift can largely be attributed to the mutual orientational dynamics of the electric dipole moments associated with the dyes, not their accessible volume. Our models provide the most up-to-date and accurate estimation of FRET.</description>

      <title>BInD: Bond and Interaction-generating Diffusion Model for Multi-objective Structure-based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A remarkable advance in geometric deep generative models with accumulated structural data enables structure-based drug design (SBDD) with target protein information only. However, most existing models struggle to address multi-objectives simultaneously while performing well only in their specialized tasks. Here, we present BInD, a diffusion model with knowledge-based guidance for multi-objective SBDD. BInD is designed to co-generate molecules and their interactions with a target protein to consider all key objectives equally well, including target-specific interactions, molecular properties, and local geometry. Comprehensive evaluations show that BInD achieves robust performance for all objectives while outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods for each. Finally, we propose a train-free optimization method empowered by retrieving target-specific interactions, highlighting the role of non-covalent interactions in achieving higher selectivity and binding affinities to a target protein.</description>
