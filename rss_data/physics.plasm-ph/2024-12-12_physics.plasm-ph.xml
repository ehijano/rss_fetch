      <title>Discharge properties of a magnetized cylindrical capacitively coupled plasma discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the discharge properties of a cylindrical magnetized capacitive coupled plasma discharge produced between a pair of coaxial cylinders. For the purpose of diagnosing plasma properties and electron energy distribution function (EEDF), an in-house electronic circuit and an RF-compensated Langmuir probe are devised and constructed. The second harmonic technique (SHT) has been applied to obtain the direct measurement of EEDF and evaluated the effect of RF electron magnetization on the bulk plasma heating within the discharge. The effect of external magnetic field on the overall rise in plasma properties has been verified by use of particle and energy balance equations derived for argon discharge.</description>

      <title>Particle-in-cell methods in edge plasma physics: the PICLS code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, multiple gyrokinetic codes have shown to be able to simulate turbulence and associated transport in the core of Tokamak devices. However, their application to the edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) region presents significant challenges. To date, only few codes and models have been adapted to SOL/edge conditions. To further study the SOL region in particular, with its steep temperature and density gradients as well as large fluctuation amplitudes, the full-f particle-in-cell code PICLS has been developed. PICLS is based on a full-f gyrokinetic model with linearised field equations, considers kinetic electrons and uses logical sheath boundary conditions. In the past, PICLS was verified by applying it to a well-studied 1D parallel transport problem during an edge-localized mode in the SOL under both collisionless and collisional conditions, for which a Lenard-Bernstein collision operator was implemented. PICLS recently was extended towards three spatial dimensions to study turbulence in open-field-line regions in slab and closed-field-line toroidal geometries. In this work, we will focus on the models and methods we used for extending the code towards three spatial dimensions, including validation efforts and comparisons with other existing codes in closed-field-line geometry</description>

      <title>Gromov ground state in phase space engineering for fusion energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase space engineering by RF waves plays important roles in both thermal D-T fusion and non-thermal advanced fuel fusion. But not all phase space manipulation is allowed, certain fundamental limits exist. In addition to Liouville's theorem, which requires the manipulation to be volume-preserving, Gromov's non-squeezing theorem imposes another constraint. The Gardner ground state is defined as the ground state accessible by smooth volume-preserving maps. However, the extra Gromov constraint should produce a higher-energy ground state. An example of a Gardner ground state forbidden by Gromov's non-squeezing theorem is given. The challenge question is: What is the Gromov ground state, i.e., the lowest energy state accessible by smooth symplectic maps? This is a difficult problem. As a simplification, we conjecture that the linear Gromov ground state problem is solvable.</description>

      <title>Ray-tracing laser-deposition model for plasma particle-in-cell simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a ray-tracing model for laser-plasma interaction suitable for coupling in-line into kinetic particle-in-cell plasma simulation. The model is based on inverse Bremsstrahlung absorption and includes oblique incidence effects and reflection at the critical surface. The energy deposition is given to electrons by randomized kicks to momentum. The model is verified against analytic solutions and a 2-D laser ray-tracing code.</description>

      <title>Constraining solar wind transport model parameters using Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply nested-sampling (NS) Bayesian analysis [AshtonEA22] to a model for the transport of MHD-scale solar wind fluctuations. The dual objectives are to obtain improved constraints on parameters present in the turbulence transport model (TTM) and to support comparisons of distinct versions of the TTM. The TTMs analysed are essentially 1D steady-state presented in [BreechEA08] that describe the radial evolution of the energy, correlation length, and normalized cross helicity of the fluctuations, together with the proton temperature, in prescribed background solar wind fields. Modelled effects present in the TTM include nonlinear turbulence interactions, shear driving, and energy injection associated with pickup-ions. These effects involve adjustable parameters that we seek to constrain. Bayesian analysis supports the efficient searching of a parameter space for the 'best' set of TTM parameter values. More advanced use provides the parameter's posterior distribution: its probability given the data, and the model. This can be used to understand the uncertainty in the provided 'best' values for the parameters and therefore the uncertainty in the suggested TTM solutions/predictions. By using NS, we can calculate the Bayesian evidence for each TTM and objectively determine which best fits the given observational data. Based on the analysis of the datasets and TTM employed, we recommend use of the 2D TTM with von Karman-Howarth parameters ${\alpha}\approx 0.16$ and $\beta \approx 0.10$ and parameter assumptions from existing literature. It is important to include the pickup ion effects in the lengthscale evolution equation by assuming $Z^{2\beta/\alpha}\lambda = const$ is locally conserved. This work is readily extended to more sophisticated solar wind models. Although more work is required to generate datasets with associated errors, which is necessary for accurate Bayesian modelling.</description>

      <title>Ionic structure, Liquid-liquid phase transitions, X-Ray diffraction, and X-Ray Thomson scattering in shock compressed liquid Silicon in the 100-200 GPa regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent cutting-edge experiments have provided {\it in situ} structure characterization and measurements of the pressure ($P$), density ($\bar{\rho}$) and temperature ($T$) of shock compressed silicon in the 100 GPa range of pressures and upto $\sim$10,000K. We present first-principles calculations in this $P,T,\bar{\rho}$ regime to reveal a plethora of novel liquid-liquid phase transitions (LPTs) identifiable via discontinuities in the pressure and the compressibility. Evidence for the presence of a highly-correlated liquid (CL) phase, as well as a normal-liquid (NL) phase at the LPTs is presented by a detailed study of one LPT. The LPTs make the interpretation of these experiments more challenging. The LPTs preserve the short-ranged ionic structure of the fluid by collective adjustments of many distant atoms when subject to compression and heating, with minimal change in the ion-ion pair-distribution functions, and in transport properties such as the electrical and thermal conductivities $\sigma$ and $\kappa$. We match the experimental X-Ray Thomson scattering and X-ray diffraction data theoretically, and provide pressure isotherms, ionization data and compressibilities that support the above picture of liquid silicon as a highly complex LPT-driven ``glassy'' metallic liquid. These novel results are relevant to materials research, studies of planetary interiors, high-energy-density physics, and in laser-fusion studies.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between a moderate level of geomagnetic activity, represented by Kp (2- - 5+), and solar wind conditions was revealed using Potential Learning (PL). We also discussed dependence of particular solar wind plasma density on moderate geomagnetic conditions. It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity solar wind density begins to control Kp. Previously, PL succeeded to extract the most influential solar wind parameters at an extremely low (0 - 1+) and high (6- - 9) Kp under southward IMF conditions. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed, and plasma density obtained from the 22 years' OMNI solar wind database were used as the inputs. PL extracted the solar wind velocity as the most significant, and further solar wind number density was the second most influential parameter for the moderate Kp under southward IMF conditions. This result was the same as the previous PL result in relation between extremely low and high Kp for southward IMF. Based on statistical investigations using solar wind speed and plasma density database used in PL under extremely low, high, and moderate Kp, geomagnetic conditions remain high while the plasma number density becomes large, even if the solar wind velocity is slow. This shows that not only solar wind velocity but also plasma density plays a crucial role in causing geomagnetic disturbances, following empirical relation between Kp and the solar wind plasma parameter. The results obtained from PL and incidental statistical investigations using the PL database suggest that the solar wind density begins to affect Kp from moderate geomagnetic activity even under southward IMF conditions. They also would greatly help not only understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity but also forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>
