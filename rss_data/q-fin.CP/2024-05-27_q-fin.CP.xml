      <title>Gaussian Recombining Split Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binomial trees are widely used in the financial sector for valuing securities with early exercise characteristics, such as American stock options. However, while effective in many scenarios, pricing options with CRR binomial trees are limited. Major limitations are volatility estimation, constant volatility assumption, subjectivity in parameter choices, and impracticality of instantaneous delta hedging. This paper presents a novel tree: Gaussian Recombining Split Tree (GRST), which is recombining and does not need log-normality or normality market assumption. GRST generates a discrete probability mass function of market data distribution, which approximates a Gaussian distribution with known parameters at any chosen time interval. GRST Mixture builds upon the GRST concept while being flexible to fit a large class of market distributions and when given a 1-D time series data and moments of distributions at each time interval, fits a Gaussian mixture with the same mixture component probabilities applied at each time interval. Gaussian Recombining Split Tre Mixture comprises several GRST tied using Gaussian mixture component probabilities at the first node. Our extensive empirical analysis shows that the option prices from the GRST align closely with the market.</description>

      <title>DSPO: An End-to-End Framework for Direct Sorted Portfolio Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantitative investment, constructing characteristic-sorted portfolios is a crucial strategy for asset allocation. Traditional methods transform raw stock data of varying frequencies into predictive characteristic factors for asset sorting, often requiring extensive manual design and misalignment between prediction and optimization goals. To address these challenges, we introduce Direct Sorted Portfolio Optimization (DSPO), an innovative end-to-end framework that efficiently processes raw stock data to construct sorted portfolios directly. DSPO's neural network architecture seamlessly transitions stock data from input to output while effectively modeling the intra-dependency of time-steps and inter-dependency among all tradable stocks. Additionally, we incorporate a novel Monotonical Logistic Regression loss, which directly maximizes the likelihood of constructing optimal sorted portfolios. To the best of our knowledge, DSPO is the first method capable of handling market cross-sections with thousands of tradable stocks fully end-to-end from raw multi-frequency data. Empirical results demonstrate DSPO's effectiveness, yielding a RankIC of 10.12\% and an accumulated return of 121.94\% on the New York Stock Exchange in 2023-2024, and a RankIC of 9.11\% with a return of 108.74\% in other markets during 2021-2022.</description>

      <title>Inference of Utilities and Time Preference in Sequential Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel stochastic control framework to enhance the capabilities of automated investment managers, or robo-advisors, by accurately inferring clients' investment preferences from past activities. Our approach leverages a continuous-time model that incorporates utility functions and a generic discounting scheme of a time-varying rate, tailored to each client's risk tolerance, valuation of daily consumption, and significant life goals. We address the resulting time inconsistency issue through state augmentation and the establishment of the dynamic programming principle and the verification theorem. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions for the identifiability of client investment preferences. To complement our theoretical developments, we propose a learning algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation within a discrete-time Markov Decision Process framework, augmented with entropy regularization. We prove that the log-likelihood function is locally concave, facilitating the fast convergence of our proposed algorithm. Practical effectiveness and efficiency are showcased through two numerical examples, including Merton's problem and an investment problem with unhedgeable risks.
  Our proposed framework not only advances financial technology by improving personalized investment advice but also contributes broadly to other fields such as healthcare, economics, and artificial intelligence, where understanding individual preferences is crucial.</description>

      <title>DeTEcT: Dynamic and Probabilistic Parameters Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical extension of the DeTEcT framework proposed by Sadykhov et al., DeTEcT, where a formal analysis framework was introduced for modelling wealth distribution in token economies. DeTEcT is a framework for analysing economic activity, simulating macroeconomic scenarios, and algorithmically setting policies in token economies. This paper proposes four ways of parametrizing the framework, where dynamic vs static parametrization is considered along with the probabilistic vs non-probabilistic. Using these parametrization techniques, we demonstrate that by adding restrictions to the framework it is possible to derive the existing wealth distribution models from DeTEcT. In addition to exploring parametrization techniques, this paper studies how money supply in DeTEcT framework can be transformed to become dynamic, and how this change will affect the dynamics of wealth distribution. The motivation for studying dynamic money supply is that it enables DeTEcT to be applied to modelling token economies without maximum supply (i.e., Ethereum), and it adds constraints to the framework in the form of symmetries.</description>
