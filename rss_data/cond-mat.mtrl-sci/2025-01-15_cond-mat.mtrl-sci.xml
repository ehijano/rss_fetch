      <title>Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Sensor for Perfluorooctanoic Acid Detection Using Two-dimensional Aluminium Quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred as "forever chemicals," are pervasive environmental pollutants due to their resistance to degradation. Among these, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) poses significant threats to human health, contaminating water sources globally. Here, we have demonstrated the potential of a novel electrochemical sensor based on two-dimensional (2D) aluminium-based multicomponent quasicrystals (2D-Al QC) for the ultrasensitive sub-picomolar level detection of PFOA. The 2D-Al QC-inked electrode was employed here to detect PFOA by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The limit of detection (LoD) achieved is 0.59 +/- 0.05 pM. The sensor was evaluated for selectivity with other interfering compounds, repeatability of cycles, and reproducibility for five similar electrodes with a deviation of 0.8 %. The stability of the sensor has also been analysed after ninety days ,which shows a minimal variation of 15%. Spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations were further utilized to understand the interaction between the 2D-Al QC and PFOA. The results demonstrate that the 2D-Al QC offers a promising platform for the rapid and sensitive detection of PFOA, potentially addressing current environmental monitoring challenges.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional (3D) tensor-based methodology for characterizing 3D anisotropic thermal conductivity tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of advanced materials with anisotropic thermal properties necessitates more generic and efficient methods to determine three-dimensional (3D) anisotropic thermal conductivity tensors with up to six independent components. Current methods rely on a vector-based framework that can handle only up to four independent components, often leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies. We introduce Three-Dimensional Spatially Resolved Lock-In Micro-Thermography (3D SR-LIT), a novel optical thermal characterization technique combining a 3D tensor-based framework with an efficient area-detection experimental system. For simple tensors (e.g., x-cut quartz, k_xz=k_yz=0), our method reduces uncertainty by over 50% compared to vector-based methods. For complex tensors with six independent components (e.g., AT-cut quartz), 2{\sigma} uncertainties remain below 12% for all components. A novel adaptive mapping approach enables high-throughput data acquisition (40 seconds to 3 minutes, depending on tensor complexity), over 35 times faster than current methods, and accommodates samples with 200 nm surface roughness. Extensive numerical validation on 1,000 arbitrary anisotropic tensors ranging from 1 to 1,000 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) further validates the robustness of this methodology. This work highlights significant advancements in thermal characterization of complex anisotropic materials.</description>

      <title>Electrical Control of the Exchange Bias Effect at Ferromagnet-Altermagnet Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes the behavior of the interface between a ferromagnetic material and an alter-magnet. We use a well-established line of arguments based on electronic mean-field calculations to show that new surface phenomena that lead to altermagnetic materials induce an exchange bias effect on the nearby ferromagnet. We reveal the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon that lead to quantitative control over its strength. Interestingly, we predict exotic electric-field-induced phenomena. This is an analogy to the relationship between exchange bias and the injection of spin currents in spin-transfer-dominated scenarios, which has been reported earlier in the traditional antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic junction.</description>

      <title>Band Structure Modeling of Perovskite Materials with Quantum ESPRESSO for Multijunction Photovoltaic Cell Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing photovoltaic conversion efficiency, or PCE, has proven to be a critical factor in the transition to renewable energy. There exist strong interdependencies between the perovskite crystals and multijunction architectures within photovoltaic cell research. In present literature, there is a lack of intersection in investigating crystallographic geometry and compositional engineering with representation of computational modeling systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the rapid discovery of high-efficiency perovskite-based multijunction cells, specifically with silicon as the low band gap absorbing semiconductor material. We model the spatial geometries of potential perovskite candidates for high-efficiency cells using the Schrodinger Material Science Maestro, optimizing the periodic boundary conditions on the unit cell to minimize edge-bound errors. Band structure calculations using density functional theory become effective to approximate the PCE. After careful adjustments to the ibrav lattice parameter and parallelization, Quantum ESPRESSO was optimized for perovskite multijunction band structure calculations. Computational results on the six test-perovskite configurations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed representation and method, with a calculated efficiency of about 46% for one of the modeled perovskites, placing it at the top of high-efficiency perovskite-Si multijunction cells. With this method, the potential exists to bring forth a new generation of photovoltaic cells that are easily manufacturable, highly efficient, and economical.</description>

      <title>A rational framework to estimate the chiroptical activity of [6]Helicene Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helicenes are a class of molecules potentially suitable in several technological applications with intrinsic structural chirality which makes them interesting scaffolds for chiroptical properties. As desirable is tuning chiroptical property by synthesis, we combine experimental optical characterization and ab-initio calculations to study how different substituents influence the optical properties of [6]helicene. We explore anchoring groups presenting a variety of sizes and chemical nature, finding that both electron withdrawing and donating groups redshift and dwindle the optical activity of the molecule. We suggest the observed dumping in transitions energy and intensity is connected to the strength of the perturbation induced by the substituent on the pi-conjugation of the aromatic rings. Such observations demonstrate how helicenes' chiroptical properties can be fine-tuned via stereochemical control of the substituents and validates a simple yet effective computational setup to model the optics of those systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Dichroism in Rutile NiF$_2$: Separating Altermagnetic and Ferromagnetic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the L$_{2,3}$ edge of Ni in the weakly ferromagnetic altermagnet NiF$_2$. Our results predict a significant XMCD signal for light propagating perpendicular to the magnetic moments, which are approximately aligned along the [100] easy-axis direction. The analysis shows that the altermagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions to the XMCD signal can be uniquely distinguished by their dependence on an applied magnetic field. By varying the angle of the field relative to the easy axis, the in-plane orientation of both the N\'eel vector and the net magnetization can be systematically controlled. We further demonstrate that the XMCD signal, even under fields as strong as 40 T and for any in-plane orientation, can be accurately described as a linear combination of two spectral components, with geometrical prefactors determined by the field magnitude and direction. This insight enables experimental validation of the distinctive relationship between the N\'eel vector orientation and the x-ray Hall vector in the rutile structure. Quantitative simulations supporting these findings are provided.</description>

      <title>The impact of alloying elements on the precipitation stability and kinetics in iron based alloys: An atomistic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron based industrial steels typically contain a large number of alloying elements, even so-called low alloyed steels. Under irradiation, these alloying elements form clusters that have a detrimental impact of the mechanical properties of the steel. The stability and formation mechanisms of such clusters are presently not fully understood. Therefore, in this work, we study the thermal stability and formation kinetics of small solute clusters in the bcc Fe matrix. We use density functional theory (DFT) to characterize the binding energy of vacancy/solute clusters containing Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Si and P, thereby exploring&gt;700 different configurations. The constructed DFT data base is used to fit a cluster expansion (CE) for the vacancy-FeCrMnNiCuSiP system. In turn, the obtained CE is applied in atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to study the effect of Mn, Ni, Cr, Si and P on the precipitation formation in the FeCu alloy. We conclude that the addition of Mn and Ni delay the precipitation kinetics by an order of magnitude. The additional alloying with traces of P/Si further delays the kinetics by an additional order of magnitude. We found that Si plays an essential role in the formation of spatially mixed MnNiCuSi cluster.</description>

      <title>Theoretical determination of Gilbert damping in reduced dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ab initio scheme based on the linear response theory of exchange torque correlation is presented to calculate intrinsic Gilbert damping parameters in magnets of reduced dimensions. The method implemented into the real-space Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (RS-KKR) Greens' function framework enables to obtain diagonal elements of the atomic-site-dependent on-site and non-local Gilbert damping tensor. Going from the 3D bulk and surfaces of iron and cobalt ferromagnets addressed in our previous work [Phys. Rev. B 109, 094417 (2024)], in the present paper monolayers of Fe and Co on (001)- and (111)-oriented Cu, Ag, and Au substrates are studied, and particularly the substrate-dependent trends are compared. Furthermore, the Gilbert damping parameters are calculated for Fe and Co adatoms and dimers on (001)-oriented substrates. It is investigated how the damping parameter of single adatoms depends on their vertical position. This dependence is quantified in relation to the adatoms' density of states at the Fermi energy showing a non-monotonic behavior. By rotating the spin moment of the adatoms and collinear magnetic dimers, an anisotropic behavior of the damping is revealed. Finally, a significant, three- to ten-times increase of the on-site Gilbert damping is found in antiferromagnetic dimers in comparison to the ferromagnetic ones, whilst the inter-site damping is even more enhanced.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide based bilayer heterojunctions for efficient solar cells and photocatalytic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a first-principles study of the optoelectronic properties of vertically-stacked bilayer heterostructures composed of 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The calculations are performed using the density-functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory within $G_0W_0$-BSE methodology. We aim to propose these TMD heterostructures for solar cell applications. The TMD monolayers comprising the heterojunctions considered in this work are $MoS_2$, $WS_2$, $MoSe_2$, and $WSe_2$ due to their favorable band gaps, high carrier mobility, robust absorption in the visible region, and excellent stability. These four TMD monolayers provide the basis for six heterostructures. Consequently, we have examined the structural, electronic, and optical properties of six heterostructures ($WS_2/MoS_2$, $MoSe_2/MoS_2$, $MoSe_2/WS_2$, $WSe_2/MoS_2$, $WSe_2/MoSe_2$, and $WSe_2/WS_2$). At the DFT level, all the six considered TMD heterostructures meet the essential criterion of type II band alignment, a critical factor in extending carrier lifetime. However, according to $G_0W_0$ results, $MoSe_2/WS_2$ does not exhibit the type II band alignment, instead it shows type I band alignment. The large quasiparticle gaps obtained from $G_0W_0$ approximation suggest the presence of strong electron-correlation effects. The quality of these heterojunction solar cells is estimated by computing their power conversion efficiencies (PCE). The PCEs are calculated at both the HSE06 and $G_0W_0$ levels, and the maximum PCE predicted by HSE06 calculations on our designed solar cells can reach up to 19.25% for the $WSe_2/WS_2$ heterojunction. In addition, all six TMD heterostructures are examined for their potential applications in photocatalysis for hydrogen evolution reaction, and the three of them, namely, $WS_2/MoS_2$, $MoSe_2/MoS_2$, and $WSe_2/MoS_2$ heterostructures qualify for the same.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling and phonon dynamics in single-layer NbSe$_2$ on graphene: the role of moir\'e phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between substrate interactions and electron-phonon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) materials presents a significant challenge in understanding and controlling their electronic properties. Here, we present a comparative study of the structural characteristics, phonon dynamics, and electron-phonon interactions in bulk and monolayer NbSe$_2$ on epitaxial bilayer graphene (BLG) using helium atom scattering (HAS). High-resolution helium diffraction reveals a (9x9)0$^{\circ}$ superstructure within the NbSe$_2$ monolayer, commensurate with the BLG lattice, while out-of-plane HAS diffraction spectra indicate a low-corrugated (3$\sqrt{3}$x3$\sqrt{3}$)30$^{\circ}$ substructure. By monitoring the thermal attenuation of the specular peak across a temperature range of 100 K to 300 K, we determined the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda_{HAS}$ as 0.76 for bulk 2H-NbSe$_2$. In contrast, the NbSe$_2$ monolayer on graphene exhibits a reduced $\lambda_{HAS}$ of 0.55, corresponding to a superconducting critical temperature (T$_C$) of 1.56 K according to the MacMillan formula, consistent with transport measurement findings. Inelastic HAS data provide, besides a set of dispersion curves of acoustic and lower optical phonons, a soft, dispersionless branch of phonons at 1.7 meV, attributed to the interface localized defects distributed with the superstructure period, and thus termed moir\'e phonons. Our data show that moir\'e phonons contribute significantly to the electron-phonon coupling in monolayer NbSe$_2$. These results highlight the crucial role of the BLG on the electron-phonon coupling in monolayer NbSe$_2$, attributed to enhanced charge transfer effects, providing valuable insights into substrate-dependent electronic interactions in 2D superconductors.</description>

      <title>OstravaJ: a tool for calculating magnetic exchange interactions via DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OstravaJ is a Python package for high-throughput calculation of exchange interaction terms in the Heisenberg model for magnetic materials. It uses the total energy difference method, where calculations are based on the total energy of the system in different magnetic configurations, calculated by means of density functional theory. OstravaJ can propose a suitable set of magnetic configurations, generate VASP configuration files in cooperation with the user, and read VASP calculation results, which minimizes necessary human interaction. It can also calculate other relevant properties (e. g. MFA and RPA critical temperature, spin-wave stiffness) and provide input for various atomistic spin dynamics codes.
  We present results for a number of materials from various classes (metals, transition metal oxides), compared to other methods. They show that the total energy difference method is a useful method for exchange interaction calculation from first principles.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort Carbon Nanotubes with Luminescent Color Centers are Ultrabright NIR-II Nano-Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining brightness and nanoscale size of short-wave infrared (SWIR) emitters is equally essential in the fields of bioimaging, photonics, and quantum science, but such nano-emitters are still lacking. Here we report that when functionalized with luminescent color centers, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with lengths much shorter than 100 nm, are surprisingly bright in the near-infrared second-biological window (NIR-II) of the SWIR. We discuss the origin of this exceptional brightness based on the uncontrollable presence of quenching defects in solubilized carbon nanotubes. The observed NIR-II brightness exceeds that of well-known visible emitters, including quantum dots. After being made biocompatible, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with luminescent color centers open the route toward point-spread function engineering and 3-dimensional single-particle studies for nanoscale NIR-II imaging in thick brain tissue.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Effects in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: Exploring Substrate Coupling and Decoupling Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substrate-adsorbate interaction can significantly influence the adsorbate's electronic structure, stability, reactivity, and topological properties. In this study, we investigate the emergence of non-Hermitian physics in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model when coupled to a substrate, focusing on the impact of substrate interaction on the electronic states of the adsorbate. We demonstrate how the coupling between the SSH chain and the underlying substrate induces non-Hermitian effects, which manifest as amplification or attenuation of zero-energy electronic states. Furthermore, inspired by novel experimental techniques such as using a scanning tunneling microscope tip to lift part of the nanomaterial, we present simulations of scenarios where a segment of the SSH chain is decoupled from the substrate. By examining various configurations, including cases with odd or even numbers of sites coupled to the substrate, we demonstrate that tuning the coupling strength induces novel phenomena, such as the emergence of a zero-energy monomode or additional zero-energy states localized at the boundary between on-surface and suspended chain segments. Our results reveal the role of substrate coupling in shaping the topological properties of non-Hermitian SSH chains, offering new insights into tunable non-Hermitian effects and their potential applications in quantum technologies and nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall effect for metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in magnetic topological insulators offers great potential to revolutionize quantum electrical metrology by establishing primary resistance standards operating at zero external magnetic field and realizing a universal "quantum electrical metrology toolbox" that can perform quantum resistance, voltage and current metrology in a single instrument. To realize such promise, significant progress is still required to address materials and metrological challenges -- among which, one main challenge is to make the bulk of the topological insulator sufficiently insulating to improve the robustness of resistance quantization. In this Perspective, we present an overview of the QAHE; discuss the aspects of topological material growth and characterization; and present a path towards an QAHE resistance standard realized in magnetically doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ systems. We also present guidelines and methodologies for QAHE resistance metrology, its main limitations and challenges as well as modern strategies to overcome them.</description>

      <title>Structural and Physical Properties of the Heavy Fermion Metal Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated electrons at the verge of quantum criticality give rise to unconventional phases of matter and behaviors, with the discovery of new quantum critical materials driving synergistic advances in both experiments and theory. In this work, we report the structural and physical properties of a new quaternary Ce-based heavy fermion compound, Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$, synthesized using the self-flux method. This compound forms a layered tetragonal structure (space group $P4/nmm$), with square nets of Ce atoms separated by Si-Al or Ni-Si-Ge layers. Specific heat measurements show a low temperature Sommerfeld coefficient of 1.4 J/mol-Ce K$^{2}$, with a reduced entropy indicative of significant Kondo interactions. Below 0.6 K, an upturn in resistivity and a deviation in magnetic susceptibility suggest the appearance of magnetic ordering or the development of dynamic magnetic correlations, which is further supported by a bulge in specific heat around 0.4 K. These results suggest that Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$ is a layered heavy fermion metal, naturally located in proximity to a spin-density-wave quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions in the Polar Ferrimagnet with a Bipartite Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polar magnets A$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ (A=Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni) feature a bipartite structure, where the magnetic A$^{2+}$ ions occupy two different sites with octahedral and tetrahedral oxygen coordinations. This bipartite structure provides a platform for the emergence of nontrivial magnetoelectric (ME) effects and intriguing excitation behaviors, and thus creates significant research interest. In this study, we conduct inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of Mn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, an L-type ferrimagnet in the A$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ family, to investigate its spin dynamics. The obtained magnetic excitation spectra reveal two distinct magnon dispersions corresponding to the octahedral and tetrahedral spins in Mn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. These magnon bands can be well described by a spin Hamiltonian including Heisenberg and single-ion anisotropy terms. Employing our effective spin model, we successfully reproduce the unusual temperature dependence of the L-type ferrimagnetic susceptibility through self-consistent mean-field theory. This research reveals the significance of the bipartite structure in determining the excitation properties of the polar magnets $\rm{A_{2}Mo_{3}O_{8}}$ and provides valuable insights into the spin dynamics of L-type ferrimagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure in Ruddlesden-Popper phases of bulk nickelates has sparked great interest in stabilizing ambient pressure superconductivity in thin-film form using epitaxial strain. Recently, signs of superconductivity have been observed in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films with an onset temperature exceeding 40 K, albeit with broad and two-step-like transitions. Here, we report intrinsic superconductivity and normal-state transport properties in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films, achieved through a combination of isovalent Pr substitution, growth optimization, and precision ozone annealing. The superconducting onset occurs above 48 K, with zero resistance reached above 30 K, and the critical current density at 1.4 K is 100-fold larger than previous reports. The normal-state resistivity exhibits quadratic temperature dependence indicative of Fermi liquid behaviour, and other phenomenological similarities to transport in overdoped cuprates suggest parallels in their emergent properties.</description>

      <title>Compact pulsed laser deposition system for in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry</title>

Abstract: The development of ferromagnet/heavy metal thin-film structures, such as CoFeB/Mo, with spin-orbit interaction requires advanced methods for their production and study. Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) provides unique insights into the evolution of magnetic properties, especially when applied in-situ during the growth process. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile method for producing magnetic thin films, and combining PLD with in-situ PNR measurements offers new possibilities for their investigation. In this work, we developed a compact vacuum chamber integrated into the neutron instrument, enabling step-by-step deposition and in-situ PNR measurements. A multilayer Mo/[CoFeB/Mo]12 structure was grown, and neutron reflectivity curves measured after each cycle revealed the gradual evolution of sample properties. A weak magnetic field response suggested the potential formation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at CoFeB/Mo interfaces. Additionally, a single CoFeB film was annealed up to 450{\deg}C, followed by the deposition of a ~5 {\AA} Mo layer. PNR measurements in magnetic fields of 0.01 T and 0.75 T showed a significant increase in in-plane magnetization, confirming PMA formation. Thus, we demonstrate the first successful operation of a combined PLD and in-situ PNR system, showcasing its capabilities for characterizing single-layer CoFeB and multilayer CoFeB/Mo thin-film structures.</description>

      <title>In-situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of automated scientific discovery has fueled progress from symbolic logic to modern AI, forging new frontiers in reasoning and pattern recognition. Transformers function as potential systems, where every possible relationship remains latent potentiality until tasks impose constraints, akin to measurement. Yet, refining their sampling requires more than probabilistic selection: solutions must conform to specific structures or rules, ensuring consistency and the invocation of general principles. We present Graph-PReFLexOR (Graph-based Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning), a framework that combines graph reasoning with symbolic abstraction to dynamically expand domain knowledge. Inspired by reinforcement learning, Graph-PReFLexOR defines reasoning as a structured mapping, where tasks yield knowledge graphs, abstract patterns, and ultimately, final answers. Inspired by category theory, it encodes concepts as nodes and their relationships as edges, supporting hierarchical inference and adaptive learning through isomorphic representations. Demonstrations include hypothesis generation, materials design, and creative reasoning, such as discovering relationships between mythological concepts like 'thin places' with materials science. We propose a 'knowledge garden growth' strategy that integrates insights across domains, promoting interdisciplinary connections. Results with a 3-billion-parameter Graph-PReFLexOR model show superior reasoning depth and adaptability, underscoring the potential for transparent, multidisciplinary AI-driven discovery. It lays the groundwork for general autonomous reasoning solutions.</description>

      <title>Origin of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ultra-thin metal films studied by in-situ neutron reflectometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) plays an important role in different spintronic devices. The rapid development of spintronics requires a better understanding of the nature and mechanisms of the PMA formation. In our article, we demonstrate the potential of studying PMA by in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry combined with pulsed laser deposition. Using these techniques, we show the formation of out-of-plane anisotropy in thin CoFeB films (1.8 nm) with a capping Mo layer. Investigating thick (5.3 nm}) and thin (0.5 nm) molybdenum films, we demonstrate that in both cases, PMA was established in bilayer structures without any thermal annealing. Also, we demonstrate how an additional silicon layer grown over the CoFeB/Mo bilayer can critically alter the magnetic properties of the sample. Such studies are possible only through the unique combination of the growth method with the in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry measurement technique. We believe that this approach will open up broad opportunities for the development and investigation of new spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Guiding polaritonic energy and momentum through two-dimensional Bravais lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong exciton absorption in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides provides a promising platform for studying polaritons with tunable dispersions, which are crucial for controlling polaritonic energy and momentum, but remain underexplored. In this work, monolayer MoS$_2$ is coupled with a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity to form polaritons. Five types of Bravais lattices with sub-wavelength periods, based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanopillars, are intentionally designed. The energy overlap between the periodic PMMA scattering wave and the polariton establishes a coupling channel that controls the directional flow of polaritonic energy, as demonstrated through angle-resolved reflectance measurements. Back-space image measurements further demonstrate that the dispersion in reciprocal space can be directly and manually tuned, allowing for control over their number and their positions. The coupling between the polariton and PMMA scattering wave is further demonstrated by analyzing the reflectance using the two-port two-mode model. The symmetries of 2D Bravais lattices allow the angle between energy and momentum flow to vary widely, from 90{\deg}, 60{\deg}, 45{\deg}, and 30{\deg} to arbitrary values. By adjusting the lattice vector lengths, the position of the dispersion branch in a specific direction can be fine-tuned, enabling full-range control over polariton dispersion. This work presents the first theoretical and experimental demonstrations of guiding the direction of polaritonic energy and momentum through Bravais lattice design.</description>

Abstract: The development of tissue engineering structures (scaffolds) for the reconstruction of bone tissue defects is the relevant task of modern biomedical materials science. Compared to metal-based structures, polymer constructs provide numerous advantages, among them - better processibility and metallosis avoidance. Owing to its high mechanical performance and biocompatibility, polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) became a promising material for the development of such structures. Previously, a method for the immobilization of hydroxyapatite (HAp) on PEKK surface was proposed by our group for the enhancement of stem cell adhesion. In the present study, we propose a single-step method of HAp immobilization on the surface of 3D-printed porous PEKK implants. The proposed approach allowed to preserve the morphology (pore diameter, width of the printed lines) of the pristine implants. With that, up to 35.0+-14.0 % of the sample surface were coated with HAp particles, which resulted in improved hydrophilicity (0 degrees water contact angle). The calcium and phosphorus content on the surface of the modified samples was up to 17.4+-4.1 and 8.0+-1.7 wt. %, respectively. Importantly, the proposed modification preserved compressive strength of the 3D-printed porous PEKK implants. HAp immobilization provided better adhesion of stem cells (from 121+-40 cells/mm2 to 234+-8 cells/mm2) and induce their osteogenic differentiation.</description>

      <title>Fabry-Perot resonance modes in a MoS$_2$-based vertical stacking cavity for strong light-matter coupling and topological phase singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rich dielectric properties in atomic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enhance light-matter interactions and contribute to a variety of optical phenomena. The direct transfer of TMDs onto photonic crystals facilitates optical field confinement and modifies photon dispersion through the generation of polaritons. However, light-matter interaction is severely limited by this stacking method. This limitation can be significantly improved by constructing a vertical stacking cavity with alternating layers of dielectric material and monolayer MoS$_2$. This multilayer structure is proven to be a compact, versatile, and customizable platform for controlling Fabry-Perot cavity resonance mode. Angle-resolved reflectance further aids in studying resonance mode dispersion. Moreover, the strong light-matter interaction results in multiple perfect absorptions, with the monolayer MoS$_2$ significantly contributing to the absorption in this system, as schematically revealed by the electric field distribution. The multiple perfect absorptions produce an unusual amounts of phase singularities with topological pairs, whose generation, evolution, and annihilation can be controlled by adjusting cavity parameters. Our findings provide a flexible and consistent framework for optimizing light-matter interactions and supporting further studies on wavefront shaping, optical vortices, and topological variants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intercalation is a robust approach for modulating the properties of epitaxial graphene on SiC and stabilizing two-dimensional (2D) intercalant layers at the graphene/SiC interface. In this work, we present synchrotron-based angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements focussing on the band structure of intercalated Pb under a single layer of epitaxial graphene. The interlayer Pb exhibits a metallic character, a $(1 \times 1)$ registry with respect to SiC, and free electron-like bands to a first order. Divergences from the free electron approximation include various band splittings and gaps throughout the Pb Brillouin zone. Light polarization dependent ARPES measurements indicate a predominant out-of-plane orbital character for the Pb bands, suggesting potential interactions between the interlayer Pb and graphene's $\pi$ orbitals that may induce proximity effects in graphene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a $(1 \times 1)$ Pb monolayer on SiC show a reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed interlayer bands as well as the polarization dependent measurements. Finally, temperature dependent ARPES measurements reveal that the nearly charge-neutral graphene layer involves charge transfer from both the interlayer Pb and the substrate SiC.</description>

Abstract: Layered materials with non-centrosymmetric stacking order are attracting increasing interest due to the presence of ferroelectric polarization, which is dictated by weak interlayer hybridization of atomic orbitals. Here, we use density functional theory modelling to systematically build a library of van der Waals chalcogenides that exhibit substantial ferroelectric polarization. For the most promising materials, we also analyse the pressure dependence of the ferroelectric effect and charge accumulation of photo-induced electrons and holes at surfaces and internal twin boundaries in thin films of such materials.</description>

Abstract: A long standing problem in time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) has been the absence of a functional able to capture excitonic physics under laser pump conditions. Here we introduce a Kohn-Sham-Proca scheme that we demonstrate reproduces both linear response excitonic effects in the absorption in excellent agreement with experiment for a wide range of materials, but also captures excitonic physics in the highly non-linear regime of ultrafast laser pumping, in particular laser fluence dependent "bleaching" (i.e. reduction) of the excitonic weight and the appearance of excitonic side bands. The approach is a procedural functional -- the Kohn-Sham and Proca equations are simultaneously time propagated -- allowing the straight-forward inclusion of, for example, lattice and spin degrees of freedom into excitonic physics.</description>

      <title>Discovering High-Entropy Oxides with a Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-entropy materials shift the traditional materials discovery paradigm to one that leverages disorder, enabling access to unique chemistries unreachable through enthalpy alone. We present a self-consistent approach integrating computation and experiment to understand and explore single-phase rock salt high-entropy oxides. By leveraging a machine-learning interatomic potential, we rapidly and accurately map high-entropy composition space using our two descriptors: bond length distribution and mixing enthalpy. The single-phase stabilities for all experimentally stabilized rock salt compositions are correctly resolved, with dozens more compositions awaiting discovery.</description>

      <title>Tailoring light holes in $\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ via Anion-Anion Antibonding Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant limitation of wide-bandgap materials is their low hole mobility related to localized holes with heavy effective masses ($m_h^*$). We identify in low-symmetric wide-bandgap compounds an anion-anion antibonding coupling (AAAC) effect as the intrinsic factor behind hole localization, which explains the extremely heavy $m_h^*$ and self-trapped hole (STH) formation observed in gallium oxide ($\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$). We propose a design principle for achieving light holes by manipulating AAAC, demonstrating that specific strain conditions can reduce $m_h^*$ in $\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ from 4.77 $m_0$ to 0.38 $m_0$, making it comparable to the electron mass (0.28 $m_0$), while also slightly suppresses the formation of self-trapped holes, evidenced by the reduction in the formation energy of hole polarons from -0.57 eV to -0.45 eV under tensile strain. The light holes show significant anisotropy, potentially enabling two-dimensional transport in bulk material. This study provides a fundamental understanding of hole mass enhancement and STH formation in novel wide-bandgap materials and suggest new pathways for engineering hole mobilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are defined as magnetic states with fully compensated spin angular momenta (spins) and broken PT (P: parity, T: time reversal, PT: parity times time reversal) symmetry. We classify three kinds of altermagnets: M-type: broken T symmetry and nonzero net magnetic moments, S-type: broken T symmetry and zero net magnetic moments, and A-type: unbroken T and broken P symmetries. Furthermore, strong altermagnets have spin split bands through exchange coupling in the non-relativistic limit, i.e., for zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and weak altermagnets has spin split bands only with non-zero SOC. These strong vs. weak altermagnets can be identified from the total number of symmetric orthogonal spin rotation operations. These classifications of altermagnets will be an essential guidance for the future research on altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamics of CaSiO3 in Earth's lower mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lower mantle of Earth, characterized by pressures of 24-127 GPa and temperatures of 1900-2600 K, is still inaccessible to direct observations. In this work, we investigate by first principles the stability, phase diagram, elastic properties, and thermal conductivity of CaSiO3, that constitutes a significant component of Earth's lower mantle. Notably, our simulations capture in full the anharmonic ionic fluctuations arising from the extreme temperatures and pressures of the lower mantle, thanks to the use of stochastic self-consistant harmonic approximation (SSCHA). We show that the cubic phase of CaSiO3 is the stable state at the lower mantle's thermodynamic conditions. The phase boundary between the cubic and tetragonal phases is of first-order and increases linearly from 300 K to 1000 K between 12 GPa and 100 GPa. Accounting for temperature-renormalized phonon dispersions, we evaluate the speed of sound as a function of depth. Our results downplay the role of octahedral rotations on the transverse sound velocity of cubic CaSiO3, advocated in the past to explain discrepancies between theory and experiments. The lattice thermal conductivity, assessed thanks to the recently introduced Wigner formalism, shows a predominance of particle-like transport, thus justifying the use of the standard Boltzmann transport equation even in a system with such strong ionic anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>rt-TDDFT modeling of thermal emission by laser-heated glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the laser processing of glass, a ~50-1000 $\mu$m-thick layer of glass is heated to a high temperature by the laser beam. Due to the shallow depth of this hot layer, the infrared emission and absorption spectra may deviate from the black-body spectra and can be influenced by the vibrational structure of the material. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) modeling of the thermal radiation by such hot layers allows us to calculate the emissivity and thus to evaluate the reliability of the measurements conducted with thermal cameras at specific wavelengths.</description>

      <title>First-principles Investigation of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$: A Multifunctional Heteroanionic Oxychalcogenide for Photocatalytic and Thermoelectric Applications</title>

Abstract: The development of industrial growth raises global energy demand. Novel materials with promising unorthodox features satiate and demand for sustainable, non-toxic, and cost-effective energy. A first-principles investigation were carried out to ground state and transport properties of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ towards energy harvesting and photocatalytic applications was carried out. In groundstate the CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ showed good mechanically stable with a volume of (1138.235 \text{\AA}^3) and a high elastic modulus of (215.73 GPa). Further, the electronic properties of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$, PBE-GGA exchange-correlation was utilized, demonstrates direct and indirect transitions with a wide bandgap of 2.7 and 2.8 eV, indicating its semiconducting nature. Photoinduced charge carriers were investigated through Deformation Potential Theory (DPT) to estimate the mobility of charge carriers, excitonic radius, and effective mass. Axial anisotropic strain in band degeneracy and shifts in the S-Y and Y-\Gamma transitions offer a (3.17 \text{\AA}^3) Frenkel-type strongly bound exciton with a high carrier mobility of (2409.91 \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}) electrons and (316.46 \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}) holes respectively. To estimate the feasibility of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ in photocatalysis, we examined the conduction and valence band edges under harsh pH conditions within PBE-GGA exchange-correlation functionals. The band edges of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ show the halfway reaction for hydrogen evolution with reference to the Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE). Moreover, the Boltzmann equation interface was used to investigate the transport and thermoelectric properties. A high Seebeck coefficient in CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ at 300 K directs a thermoelectric figure of merit of 0.94.</description>

      <title>Collineations of particles in the Kob-Andersen system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous indications suggest that subtle changes occurring in the structures of liquids on supercooling are connected to the phenomenon of the glass transition and that detailed understanding of these changes is crucial for the development of new glasses with desired properties. J.D. Bernal in his 1962 Bakerian lecture, in particular, reported about an observation of approximately linear chains of several particles, referred to as collineations. He found that in the studied hard sphere system, these collineations can contain up to eight particles. Since then, the collineations of three particles have been discussed in many papers in the context of the splitting of the second peak in pair density functions of supercooled liquids and glasses. However, it appears that longer collineations involving more that three particles have not been systematically studied. Here, we report on our study of such collineations for the Kob-Andersen system of particles on cooling for the parent and inherent structures. Contrary to intuition, our findings reveal that below the potential energy landscape crossover temperature, the number of collineations in the parent structures can exceed that of the corresponding inherent structures. We also introduce a model that connects long collineations with the pair density and angular density distribution functions and demonstrate that this model describes long collineations quite well. The second part of the paper explores potential connections between collineations and: 1) the disclination lines associated with the geometric frustration approach, 2) low-energy clusters from the topological cluster classification approach, 3) chain-like cooperative motion of particles in low-temperature supercooled liquids. For the studied system, according to the used methods, no clear connection was found between collineations and these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Optically and Magnetically Active Edges in Phosphorene Nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoribbons - nanometer wide strips of a two-dimensional material - are a unique system in condensed matter physics. They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times, quantum confinement and topologically protected states can emerge. An exciting prospect for this new material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge. This combination of magnetism and semiconducting properties is the first step in unlocking spin-based electronics such as non-volatile transistors, a route to low-energy computing, and has thus far typically only been observed in doped semiconductor systems and/or at low temperatures. Here, we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). Static (SQUID) and dynamic (EPR) magnetization probes demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs exhibit macroscopic magnetic properties, arising from their edge, with internal fields of ~ 250 to 800 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at modest sub-1T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that upon photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funneled to a dark-exciton state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a unique candidate system for studying the interplay of magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced phase transitions in double HgTe quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the self-consistent Born approximation, we investigate topological phase transitions in double HgTe quantum wells (QWs) induced by the short-range impurities. Following the evolution of the density-of-states and the spectral function, we demonstrate multiple closings and openings of the band-gap with the increase of the disorder strength due to the mutual inversions between the first and second electron-like and hole-like subbands. We show that starting from a band insulator in the clean limit, under the influence of disorder, the double HgTe QW undergoes a transition, first into a semimetal state similar to "bilayer graphene", and then into a high-order topological insulator state with a double band inversion. We find out that all disorder-induced transitions can be fully characterized by introducing a non-Hermitian quasiparticle Hamiltonian encoding the band structure renormalization and quasiparticle decay.</description>

      <title>SeeBand: A highly efficient, interactive tool for analyzing electronic transport data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linking the fundamental physics of band structure and scattering theory with macroscopic features such as measurable bulk thermoelectric transport properties is indispensable to a thorough understanding of transport phenomena and ensures more targeted and efficient experimental research. Here, we introduce SeeBand, a highly efficient and interactive fitting tool based on Boltzmann transport theory. A fully integrated user interface and visualization tool enable real-time comparison and connection between the electronic band structure (EBS) and microscopic transport properties. It allows simultaneous analysis of data for the Seebeck coefficient $S$, resistivity $\rho$ and Hall coefficient $R_\text{H}$ to identify suitable EBS models and extract the underlying microscopic material parameters and additional information from the model. Crucially, the EBS can be obtained by directly fitting the temperature-dependent properties of a single sample, which goes beyond previous approaches that look into doping dependencies. Finally, the combination of neural-network-assisted initial guesses and an efficient subsequent fitting routine allows for a rapid processing of big datasets, facilitating high-throughput analyses to identify underlying, yet undiscovered dependencies, thereby guiding material design.</description>

      <title>Expression with self-consistent magnetic units for calculation of critical current density using the Bean's Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes the calculation of the critical current density Jc,mag by means of Bean's critical state model, using the equation formulated by Gyorgy et al. and other similar equations derived from it reported in the literature. While estimations of Jc,mag using Bean's model are widely performed, improper use of different equations with different magnetic units and pre-factors leads to confusion and to significant errors in the reported values of Jc,mag. In this work, a SINGLE general equation is proposed for the calculation of Jc,mag for a rectangular parallelepiped sample in perpendicular field using Bean's critical state model, underlying how the simple conversion of magnetic units can lead to a Jc,mag in the desired units, without the need to introduce any other correction or use other specific equations depending on the units of Jc,mag. In this equation, the numerical pre-factor is dimensionless, independent of the unit system used. A comparison between the expression reported in the literature is done, showing how they can lead to different results depending on the used units, and that these results can be at least one order of magnitude different from the correct results obtained with the general equation proposed in this work. This resolves all ambiguities and aligns with the correct dimensional analysis, eliminates discrepancies in the calculated Jc,mag, and will avoid further propagation of errors in the literature.</description>

      <title>Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</description>
