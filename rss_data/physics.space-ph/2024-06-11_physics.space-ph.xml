      <title>Omnidirectional Energetic Electron Fluxes from 150 km to 20,000 km: an ELFIN-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong variations of energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's inner magnetosphere are notoriously hard to forecast. Developing accurate empirical models of electron fluxes from low to high altitudes at all latitudes is therefore useful to improve our understanding of flux variations and to assess radiation hazards for spacecraft systems. In the present work, energy- and pitch-angle-resolved precipitating, trapped, and backscattered electron fluxes measured at low altitude by Electron Loss and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) CubeSats are used to infer omnidirectional fluxes at altitudes below and above the spacecraft, from 150 km to 20,000 km, making use of adiabatic transport theory and quasi-linear diffusion theory. The inferred fluxes are fitted as a function of selected parameters using a stepwise multivariate optimization procedure, providing an analytical model of omnidirectional electron flux along each geomagnetic field line, based on measurements from only one spacecraft in low Earth orbit. The modeled electron fluxes are provided as a function of L-shell, altitude, energy, and two different indices of past geomagnetic activity, computed over the preceding 4 hours or 3 days, potentially allowing to disentangle impulsive processes (such as rapid injections) from cumulative processes (such as inward radial diffusion and wave-driven energization). The model is validated through comparisons with equatorial measurements from the Van Allen Probes, demonstrating the broad applicability of the present method. The model indicates that both impulsive and time-integrated geomagnetic activity partly control electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt and in the plasma sheet.</description>

      <title>Direct observations of cross-scale energy transfer in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collisionless plasmas in space and astrophysical environments are intrinsically multiscale in nature, behaving as conducting fluids at macroscales and kinetically at microscales comparable to ion- and/or electron-gyroradii. A fundamental question in understanding the plasma dynamics is how energy is transported and dissipated across different scales. Here, we present spacecraft measurements in the solar wind upstream of the terrestrial bow shock, in which the macroscale ultra-low-frequency waves and microscale whistler waves simultaneously resonate with the ions. The ion acceleration from ultra-low-frequency waves leads to velocity distributions unstable to the growth of whistler waves, which in turn resonate with the electrons to complete cross-scale energy transfer. These observations, consistent with numerical simulations in the occurrence of phase-bunched ion and electron distributions, also highlight the importance of anomalous resonance, a nonlinear modification of the classical cyclotron resonance, in the cross-scale wave coupling and energy transfer processes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Interactions of Planetary-Scale Waves in Mesospheric Winds Observed at 52{\deg}N Latitude and Two Longitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05848v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nine years of mesospheric wind data from two meteor radars at 52{\deg}N latitude were analyzed to investigate planetary waves (PWs) and tides by estimating their zonal wavenumber through longitudinal phase differences. Our results reveal that PW normal modes (NMs) primarily drive multi-day oscillations, showing seasonal variability and statistical associations with Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) events. Specifically, a significant 6-day NM emerges in April, followed by predominant 4- and 2-day NMs until June, with peaks of 2-, 4-, and 6-day NMs spanning July to October. Furthermore, our study provides the first observational verification of frequency and zonal wavenumber of over ten secondary waves from nonlinear interactions among planetary-scale waves. One notable finding is the prevalence of non-migrating components in winter 24-hour and summer 8-hour tides, attributed to these nonlinear interactions. Our findings underscore the diverse nonlinear dynamics of planetary-scale waves, triggering a variety of periodic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Performance Test Methodology for Atmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion Intakes in an Atomic Oxygen Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The testing of atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion intakes is an important step in the development of functional propulsion systems which provide sustained drag compensation in very low Earth orbits. To make satellite operations more sustainable, it is necessary to develop new materials which withstand erosion, long-lasting propulsion systems to overcome drag, and tools that allow for ground-based testing. Among the tools to enable these innovations is the Rarefied Orbital Aerodynamics Research facility at the University of Manchester. Here, a description of the facility is provided together with two different methodologies for testing sub-scaled intake designs for atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion systems. The first methodology is based on measurements of the pressure difference between the two extremities of the intake, while the second uses a gas sensor to measure the collection efficiency of the intake. Direct Simulation Monte Carlo models have been used to assess the viability of the proposed testing methodologies. The results of this analysis indicate that either methodology or a combination of both can provide suitable measurements to assess the performance of future intake designs.</description>

      <title>Prevalence of non-standard collapsing of strong Langmuir turbulence in solar corona plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully-kinetic simulation of the full life cycle of strong Langmuir turbulence (SLT) excited by electron beams that are accelerated under the solar corona conditions. We find that (1) most packets ($\sim$80%) are affected by their neighbors during their collapse, as a result, their spatial scale variations present non-standard evolutionary features, i.e., deviating away from what was predicted by the Zakharov model; (2) the collapsing cavity is too shallow to trap the wave packet due to the growth of the Coulomb force, as a result a majority ($\sim$70%) of the packet energy runs away and a secondary localization may occur. The study indicates that the non-standard Langmuir collapse may play an important role in coronal plasmas interacting with an intense electron beam, that may be eventually confirmed by humanity's first mission to fly through the corona.</description>

      <title>A detailed survey of the parallel mean free path of solar energetic particle protons and electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, more than a dozen solar energetic particle (SEP) events are identified where the source region is magnetically well-connected to at least one spacecraft at 1~au. The observed intensity-time profiles, for all available proton and electron energy channels, are compared to results computed using a numerical 1D SEP transport model in order to derive the parallel mean free paths (pMFPs) as a function of energy (or rigidity) at 1~au. These inversion results are then compared to theoretical estimates of the pMFP, using observed turbulence quantities with observationally-motivated variations as input. For protons, a very good comparison between inversion and theoretical results is obtained. It is shown that the observed inter-event variations in the inversion pMFP values can be explained by natural variations in the background turbulence values. For electrons, there is relatively good agreement with pMFPs derived assuming the damping model of dynamical turbulence, although the theoretical values are extremely sensitive to the details of the turbulence dissipation range which themselves display a high level of variation.</description>

      <title>Simulation Models for Exploring Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations have played a critical role in the advancement of our knowledge of magnetic reconnection. However, due to the inherently multiscale nature of reconnection, it is impossible to simulate all physics at all scales. For this reason, a wide range of simulation methods have been crafted to study particular aspects and consequences of magnetic reconnection. This chapter reviews many of these methods, laying out critical assumptions, numerical techniques, and giving examples of scientific results. Plasma models described include magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), Hall MHD, Hybrid, kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC), kinetic Vlasov, Fluid models with embedded PIC, Fluid models with direct feedback from energetic populations, and the Rice Convection Model (RCM).</description>

      <title>Exploring the generation and annihilation of three dimensional nulls through MHD simulations in initially chaotic magnetic field devoid of nulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nulls are abundant in the solar atmosphere, as been firmly established through contemporary observations. They are established to be important magnetic structures in, for example, jets and circular ribbon flares. While simulations and extrapolations support this, the mechanisms behind 3D null generation remain an open question. Recent magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations propose that magnetic reconnection is responsible for both generating and annihilating 3D nulls, a novel concept. However, these simulations began with initial magnetic fields already supporting pre-existing nulls, raising the question of whether magnetic reconnection can create nulls in fields initially devoid of them. Previously, this question was briefly explored in a simulation with an initial chaotic magnetic field. However, the study failed to precisely identify locations, topological degrees, and natures (spiral or radial) of nulls, and it approximated magnetic reconnection without fully tracking field line in time. In this paper these findings are revisited in light of recent advancements and tools used to locate and trace nulls, along with the tracing of field lines, through which the concept of generation/annihilation of 3D nulls from chaotic fields is established in a precise manner.</description>
