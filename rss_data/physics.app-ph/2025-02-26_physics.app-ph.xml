      <title>Scalable, universal and conformal direct electrodes microprinting for high-performance van der Waals-integrated two-dimensional electronics and flexible applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with extraordinary electrical properties, hold promising for large-scale, flexible electronics. However, their device performance could be hindered due to the excessive defects introduced via traditional electrode integration processes. Transfer printing techniques have been developed for van der Waals contacts integration, while existing techniques encounter limitations in achieving conformal electrode transfer and compatibility with flexible devices. Here we introduce a highly conformal microprinting technique utilizing polypropylene carbonate (PPC)/Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) copolymer, which enables successful transfer of wafer-scale, micropatterned electrodes onto diverse substrates, including those with complex geometries. This technique, implemented with 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), yields 2D field-effect transistors with near-ideal ohmic contacts, and a record-high carrier mobility up to 334 cm2 V-1 s-1 for a WSe2 device. Furthermore, we fabricated transistor arrays on MoS2 thin film, which show uniform device performance. We also present the flexible MoS2 transistors that not only achieve a high electron mobility of up to 111 cm2 V-1 s-1 but also exhibit outstanding mechanical robustness. Our findings represent a significant leap forward in the fabrication of flexible 2D electronics, paving the way for numerous emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Topology Design of Reconffgurable Intelligent Surfaces Based on Current Distribution and Otsu Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturization of reconffgurable intelligent surface RIS) elements is a crucial trend in the development of RISs. It not only facilitates the attainment of multifunctional integration but also promotes seamless amalgamation with other elements. The current on the RIS element plays a crucial role in determining the characteristics of the induced electromagnetic ffeld components. Segments with high current intensity determine the performance of RIS elements. Carving the parts with strong current distribution density into the metal patch of RIS element structure can achieve miniaturization. Based on this insight, this work proposes a topology design method that leverages current distribution and image processing techniques to achieve efffcient miniaturization of the RIS elements. In this proposed method, we ffrst obtain the current distribution across different operational states and the period of the working frequency. Next, we employ the Otsu image segmentation method to extract relevant image information from the current distribution images of the RIS elements. Subsequently, we utilize linear mapping techniques to convert this image information into the structure of RIS elements. Then, based on the structure of the RIS elements, the Quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is utilized to obtain the parameters of the tunable device that correspond to various operational states. As a result, we successfully construct the structural topology of the RIS elements based on their current distribution, designing areas with strong current distribution as metal patches. To validate the performance of the proposed method, a 16 by 16 3-bit RIS was developed, fabricated and measured. Compared with existing RIS designs, the proportion of the top-layer metal patches is smaller, which provides the possibility for integrating other functions and devices.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional magnetization switching in ferrimagnetic system by adsorption of single-handed chiral materials-elucidation of exchange interactions and spin-polarized electron bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that magnetization switching in ferromagnets can be achieved through adsorbing chiral molecules on the surface without the need for current or external magnetic fields, offering a low-power mechanism for applications in spintronic devices. Opposite chirality molecules cause opposite direction reversals of magnetization through the chiral-induced spin switching (CISS) mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate bidirectional magnetization switching in thin films of ferrimagnetic insulator TmIG using a single chirality molecule - a Cu metallopolymer of D-leucine. Through circular dichroism and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we determined that switching between different magnetic orientations is associated with interactions of the D-leucine with the two distinct sublattices of the Fe ions in the TmIG, at octahedral and tetrahedral sites. Our study demonstrates the unexpected versatility of the CISS mechanism for magnetization switching in ferrimagnets using single chirality materials, thereby expanding the potential applications of chiral molecule adsorption-induced magnetization flipping.</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Design: Multi-port Network Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a novel approach to flexibly adjust the wireless environment, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have shown significant application potential across various domains, including wireless communication, radar detection, and the Internet of Things. Currently, mainstream design methods for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces face inherent limitations. For instance, while the full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation method offers strong universality, it suffers from low efficiency. Machine learning-based methods can effectively reduce design time but are heavily dependent on full-wave EM simulations. Although the design methods based on the equivalent circuit can lessen the reliance on full-wave EM simulations, they still struggle with insufficient model accuracy when dealing with complex element structures. In recent years, a new multi-port network method has been introduced to RIS design. This method has significantly enhanced the accuracy of modeling complex structures. It reduces the dependency on full-wave EM simulations and substantially shortens the design time. This work provides a detailed exploration of the RIS element design strategy based on multi-port network and discusses future development trends in this field.</description>

      <title>Deployable Nanoelectromechanical Bound States in the Continuum Enabled by GHz Lamb Wave Phononic Crystals on LiNbO3 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are a fascinating class of eigenstates that trap energy within the continuum, enabling breakthroughs in ultra-low-threshold lasing, high-Q sensing, and advanced wave-matter interactions. However, their stringent symmetry requirements hinder practical integration, especially in acoustic and electromechanical systems where efficient mode excitation is challenging. Here, we demonstrate deployable nanoelectromechanical quasi-BICs on suspended lithium niobate (LiNbO3) thin films, enabled by nanoscale Lamb wave phononic crystals (PnCs) operating at gigahertz frequencies. By exploiting the decoupling of symmetric (S) and antisymmetric (A) Lamb wave modes, we create a robust framework for BICs. Controlled mirror symmetry breaking induces targeted coupling between the S and A modes, resulting in quasi-BICs that preserve high-Q characteristics and can be excited by traveling waves, eliminating the need for specialized excitation schemes. Our approach enables the multiplexing of quasi-BIC resonators along a single transmission line, each corresponding to a unique frequency and spatial position. This work presents a scalable route for the on-chip integration of BICs, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical nanoelectromechanical devices, and opening new avenues in advanced signal processing, high-precision sensing, and quantum acoustics.</description>

      <title>Monolithic On-Chip Phononic Chiral Anomalous Bulk States on LiNbO3 Thin-films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phononic materials are crucial for developing efficient, robust mechanical waveguides with strong transport properties, enabling advances in sensing, signal processing, energy harvesting, and microfluidics. A key motivation is their integration into monolithic systems for on-chip applications. While topological phononic materials developed in the past decade offer unidirectional edge states immune to backscattering, their integration requires large volumes to control localized small volumes' transport properties, limiting their efficiency and application in modern phononic circuits. The recently introduced chiral anomalous bulk states (CABSs) combine the advantages of topological materials with innovative boundary designs, overcoming transmission limitations and ensuring full material utilization for superior wave propagation. Here, we present the first on-chip monolithic CABS device integrated on a suspended LiNbO3 thin film. This breakthrough enables the creation of phononic waveguides with unmatched unidirectionality, low loss, and high transmission efficiency, seamlessly integrated with broadband piezoelectric transducers, and showcasing their potential for high-fidelity, broad-bandwidth microwave signal transmission. Additionally, we exploit the slow-wave characteristics of CABSs for delay lines and high-density signal processing. Tailoring wave propagation through boundary engineering opens a new paradigm for phononic/photonic device design, with implications across microelectronics, high-frequency communications, radar, and advanced sensing technologies. The work sets the stage for the future development of highly scalable, multifunctional, and robust phononic systems, unlocking new avenues for integrated acoustic technologies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging resonant frequencies of an optical cavity for spectroscopic measurement of gas temperature and concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spectroscopic approach to primary gas thermometry, harnessing precise optical cavity resonance frequencies and ab initio molecular line intensity calculations. By utilizing CO (3-0) vibrational band lines and cavity mode dispersion spectroscopy, we achieve an uncertainty of 82 ppm (24 mK at 296 K) in line-intensity-ratio thermometry (LRT) - over an order of magnitude lower than any previously reported spectroscopic thermometry at gas pressures above 1.2 kPa. This method extends high-precision spectroscopic thermometry across a pressure range an order of magnitude larger than prior techniques, enabling a fully optical, non-contact, and molecule-selective primary amount-of-substance measurement. We further demonstrate sub-permille uncertainty in gas concentration measurements across pressures from 50 Pa to 20 kPa, significantly enhancing the precision and versatility of spectroscopic gas metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightsails are a highly promising spacecraft concept that has attracted interest in recent years due to its potential to travel at near-relativistic speeds. Such speeds, which current conventional crafts cannot reach, offer tantalizing opportunities to probe nearby stellar systems within a human lifetime. Recent advancements in photonics and metamaterials have created novel solutions to challenges in propulsion and stability facing lightsail missions. This review introduces the physical principles underpinning lightsail spacecrafts and discusses how photonics coupled with inverse design substantially enhance lightsail performance compared to plain reflectors. These developments pave the way through a previously inaccessible frontier of space exploration.</description>

      <title>A Peanut-hull-PLA based 3D printing filament with antimicrobial effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peanut hulls, also known as Arachis hypogaea L. particles (AHL), are an abundant biomass source with a long shelf life. In this study, we incorporate peanut hull powder into PLA polymer, imparting recyclability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, along with the antimicrobial properties of AHL particles. In particular, we treat AHL particles as a reinforcement for PLA polymer to produce 3D printing filament compatible with the fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing method. We provide a step-by-step method for preparing AHL particles, incorporating them into PLA, and ultimately forming high-quality filaments. We assess the quality of the filaments in terms of extruded dimensions, mechanical strength, and elastic modulus, along with physical properties such as porosity and melt flow index. We evaluate the printability and wettability of the filaments as well. Notably, and unlike other biomass-based reinforcements in PLA, AHL preserves the filament's strength and enhances its elastic modulus. 3D-printed components fabricated using our PLA-AHL filaments successfully retain their antimicrobial properties and exhibit increased overall hardness. However, this comes at the expense of forming more microvoids and a rougher surface, making the material more prone to fracture and leading to a slight reduction in fracture toughness with increasing AHL mass fraction.</description>

      <title>Reversible magneto ionics in crystallized W Co20Fe60B20 MgO HfO2 ultra-thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated electric field (E-field) induced modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in both amorphous and crystalline W/CoFeB/MgO/HfO2 ultra-thin films. We find that in the amorphous state, the E-field effect is volatile and reversible, which is consistent with the conventional electrostatic effect through charge accumulation and depletion. In the crystallized system annealed at 370{\deg}C, we find that two effects are at play, a non-volatile and reversible voltage-induced effect on PMA and an electrostatic response. We discuss these results in terms of higher oxygen mobility at the crystallized CoFeB-MgO interface, which induces a non-volatile magneto-ionic response. Modulating PMA in crystallized CoFeB-MgO materials through ionic migration opens the path to integrating magneto-ionics in full magnetic tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Josephson junctions -- the effects of depinning physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Ion counting and temperature determination of Coulomb-crystallized laser-cooled ions in traps using convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb crystals, ordered structures of cold ions confined in ion traps, find applications in a variety of research fields. The number and temperature of the ions forming the Coulomb crystals are two key attributes of interest in many trapped-ion experiments. Here, we present a fast and accurate approach of determining these attributes from fluorescence images of the ions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this approach, we first generate a large number of images of Coulomb crystals with different ion numbers and temperatures using molecular-dynamics simulations and then train CNN models on these images to classify the desired attributes. The classification performance of several common pre-trained CNN models was compared in example tasks. We find that for crystals with ion numbers in the range 100-299 and secular temperatures of 5-15 mK, the best-performing model can discern number variations on the level of one ion with an accuracy of 93% and temperature variations by 1 mK with an accuracy of 92%. Since the trained model can be directly integrated into experiments, in-situ determination of these attributes can be realized in a non-invasive fashion, which has the potential to greatly facilitate the analysis and control of trapped ions in real time.</description>

      <title>Distributed Saddle-Point Dynamics in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a more advanced and comprehensive framework for modeling real-world systems compared to traditional single-layer and multiplex networks. Unlike single-layer models, multilayer networks have multiple interacting layers, each with unique topological features. In this paper, we generalize previously developed results for distributed optimization in multiplex networks to the more general case of multilayer networks by employing a tensor formalism to represent multilayer networks and their tensor-Laplacian diffusion dynamics. Although multiplex networks are a special case of multilayer networks, where each layer has the same number of replica nodes connected one-to-one, this generalized framework removes the need for replica nodes, allowing variability in both topology and number of nodes across layers. This approach provides a fully generalized structure for distributed optimization in multilayer networks and enables more complex interlayer connections. We derive the multilayer combinatorial Laplacian tensor and extend the distributed gradient descent algorithm. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence of algorithms. Numerical examples validate our approach, and we explore the impact of heterogeneous layer topologies and complex interlayer dynamics on consensus time, underscoring their implications for real-world multilayer systems.</description>
