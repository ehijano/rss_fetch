      <title>Machine Learning Based Cyber System Restoration for IEC 61850 Based Digital Substations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substation Automation Systems (SAS) that adhere to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61850 standard have already been widely implemented across various on-site local substations. However, the digitalization of substations, which involves the use of cyber system, inherently increases their vulnerability to cyberattacks. This paper proposes the detection of cyberattacks through an anomaly-based approach utilizing Machine Learning (ML) methods within central control systems of the power system network. Furthermore, when an anomaly is identified, mitigation and restoration strategies employing concurrent Intelligent Electronic Devices (CIEDs) are utilized to ensure robust substation automation system operations. The proposed ML model is trained using Sampled Value (SV) and Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) data from each substation within the entire transmission system. As a result, the trained ML models can classify cyberattacks and normal faults, while the use of CIEDs contributes to cyberattack mitigation, and substation restoration.</description>

      <title>Research on fault diagnosis of nuclear power first-second circuit based on hierarchical multi-granularity classification network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safe and reliable operation of complex electromechanical systems in nuclear power plants is crucial for the safe production of nuclear power plants and their nuclear power unit. Therefore, accurate and timely fault diagnosis of nuclear power systems is of great significance for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of nuclear power plants. The existing fault diagnosis methods mainly target a single device or subsystem, making it difficult to analyze the inherent connections and mutual effects between different types of faults at the entire unit level. This article uses the AP1000 full-scale simulator to simulate the important mechanical component failures of some key systems in the primary and secondary circuits of nuclear power units, and constructs a fault dataset. Meanwhile, a hierarchical multi granularity classification fault diagnosis model based on the EfficientNet large model is proposed, aiming to achieve hierarchical classification of nuclear power faults. The results indicate that the proposed fault diagnosis model can effectively classify faults in different circuits and system components of nuclear power units into hierarchical categories. However, the fault dataset in this study was obtained from a simulator, which may introduce additional information due to parameter redundancy, thereby affecting the diagnostic performance of the model.</description>

      <title>Two-Layer Attention Optimization for Bimanual Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimanual tasks performed by human agents present unique optimal control considerations compared to cyberphysical agents. These considerations include minimizing attention, distributing attention across two isolated hands, and coordinating the two hands to reach a broader goal. In this work, we propose a two-layer controller that captures these considerations. The upper layer solves an attention distribution problem, while the two lower layer controllers (one per hand) tracks a trajectory using the solution given by the upper layer. We introduce a formulation of the attention controller where attention is a vector that is bound within a hyperbolic feasible region, which is determined by specifications of the task the lower layer controllers. This two-layer controller is used to optimize a single-player game of pong, where the agent must rally the ball between two paddles for as long as possible. We find that adding an attention layer on top of the lower controllers allows the agent to coordinate the left and right hands, which minimizes attention and control effort over the course of the rallying task.</description>

      <title>Convergence Guarantees for Differentiable Optimization-based Control Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective control of real-world systems necessitates the development of controllers that are not only performant but also interpretable. To this end, the field has seen a surge in model-based control policies, which first leverage historical data to learn system cost and dynamics, and then utilize the learned models for control. However, due to this decoupling, model-based control policies fall short when deployed in optimal control settings and lack convergence guarantees for achieving optimality. In this paper, we present DiffOP, a Differentiable Optimization-based Policy for optimal control. In the proposed framework, control actions are derived by solving an optimization, where the control cost and system's dynamics can be parameterized as neural networks. The key idea of DiffOP, inspired by differentiable optimization techniques, is to jointly learn the control policy using both policy gradients and optimization gradients, while utilizing actual cost feedback during system interaction. Further, this study presents the first theoretical analysis of the convergence rates and sample complexity for learning the optimization control policy with a policy gradient approach.</description>

      <title>Lateral String Stability in Autonomous &amp; Connected Vehicle Platoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the lateral control of Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (ACVs) in a platoon executing an Emergency Lane Change (ELC) maneuver. These maneuvers are typically triggered by emergency signals from the front or rear of the platoon in response to the need to avoid obstacles or allow other vehicles to pass. The study assumes that ACVs maintain reliable connectivity, enabling each following vehicle to access GPS position traces of both the lead and immediately preceding vehicles in the platoon. We demonstrate that lateral string stability in the ACV platoon can be achieved using communicated information solely from the lead and preceding vehicles. Additionally, we present a lateral control framework for ACVs, which helps track a discretized preview of the trajectory constructed from the communicated data. This framework involves constructing two distinct trajectories based on the preview data from the lead and preceding vehicles, calculating the associated errors and lateral control actions for each, and then integrating these to generate a steering command. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed lateral control scheme.</description>

      <title>Constructive RNNs: An Error-Recurrence Perspective on Time-Variant Zero Finding Problem Solving Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When facing time-variant problems in analog computing, the desirable RNN design requires finite-time convergence and robustness with respect to various types of uncertainties, due to the time-variant nature and difficulties in implementation. It is very worthwhile to explore terminal zeroing neural networks, through examining and applying available attracting laws. In this paper, from a control-theoretic point of view, an error recurrence system approach is presented by equipping with uncertainty compensation in the pre-specified error dynamics, capable of enhancing robustness properly. Novel rectifying actions are designed to make finite-time settling so that the convergence speed and the computing accuracy of time-variant computing can be improved. Double-power and power-exponential rectifying actions are respectively formed to construct specific models, while the particular expressions of settling time function for the former are presented, and for the latter the proximate settling-time estimations are given, with which the fixed-time convergence of the corresponding models is in turn established. Moreover, the uncertainty compensation by the signum/smoothing-signum techniques are adopted for finite-duration stabilization. Theoretical results are presented to demonstrate effectiveness (involving fixed-time convergence and robustness) of the proposed computing schemes for the time-variant QP problem solving.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal dynamic modelling and control for a quad-tilt rotor UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilt rotor aircraft combine the benefits of both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, this makes them popular for a variety of applications, including Search and Rescue and VVIP transport. However, due to the multiple flight modes, significant challenges with regards to the control system design are experienced. The main challenges with VTOL aircraft, comes during the dynamic phase (mode transition), where the aircraft transitions from a hover state to full forwards flight. In this transition phase the aerodynamic lift and torque generated by the wing/control surfaces increases and as such, the rotor thrust, and the tilt rate must be carefully considered, such that the height and attitude remain invariant during the mode transition. In this paper, a digital PID controller with the applicable digital filter and data hold functions is designed so that a successful mode transition between hover and forwards flight can be ascertained. Finally, the presented control system for the tilt-rotor UAV is demonstrated through simulations by using the MATLAB software suite. The performance obtained from the simulations confirm the success of the implemented methods, with full stability in all three degrees of freedom being demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Robust control for uncertain air-to-air missile systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-to-air missiles are used on many modern military combat aircraft for self-defence. It is imperative for the pilots using the weapons that the missiles hit their target first time. The important goals for a missile control system to achieve are minimising the time constant, overshoot, and settling time of the missile dynamics. The combination of high angles of attack, time-varying mass, thrust, and centre of gravity, actuator delay, and signal noise create a highly non-linear dynamic system with many uncertainties that is extremely challenging to control. A robust control system based on saturated sliding mode control is proposed to overcome the time-varying parameters and non-linearities. A lag compensator is designed to overcome actuator delay. A second-order filter is selected to reduce high-frequency measurement noise. When combined, the proposed solutions can make the system stable despite the existence of changing mass, centre of gravity, thrust, and sensor noise. The system was evaluated for desired pitch angles of 0{\deg} to 90{\deg}. The time constant for the system stayed below 0.27s for all conditions, with satisfactory performance for both settling time and overshoot.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Control of Subsonic Missile for Air-to-Air Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsonic missiles play an important role in modern air-to-air combat scenarios - utilized by the F-35 Lightning II - but require complex Guidance, Navigation and Control systems to manoeuvre with 30G's of acceleration to intercept successfully. Challenges with mathematically modelling and controlling such a dynamic system must be addressed, high frequency noise rejected, and actuator delay compensated for. This paper aims to investigate the control systems necessary for interception. It also proposes a subsonic design utilizing literature and prior research, suggests aerodynamic derivatives, and analyses a designed 2D reduced pitch autopilot control system response against performances. The pitch autopilot model contains an optimized PID controller, 2nd order actuator, lead compensator and Kalman Filter, that rejects time varying disturbances and high frequency noise expected during flight. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method through reduction in rise time (21%), settle time (10%), and highlighted its high frequency deficiency with respect to the compensator integration. The actuator delay of 100ms has been negated by the augmented compensator autopilot controller so that it exceeds system performance requirements (1) &amp; (3). However, (2) is not satisfied as 370% overshoot exists. This research confirms the importance of a lead compensator in missile GNC systems and furthers control design application through a specific configuration. Future research should build upon methods and models presented to construct and test an interception scenario.</description>

      <title>Node Reliability: Approximation, Upper Bounds, and Applications to Network Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the reliability of a graph in which the links are perfectly reliable but the nodes may fail with certain probability p. Calculating graph node reliability is an NP-Hard problem. We introduce an efficient and accurate Monte Carlo method and a stochastic approximation for the node reliability polynomial based solely on the degree distribution. We provide the formulas for the node reliability polynomial of both Erdos-Renyi graphs and Random Geometric graphs. The phase transition in the node reliability of Erdos-Renyi graphs is also discussed. Additionally, we propose two increasingly accurate upper bounds for the node reliability polynomial solely based on the graph's degree distributions. The advantages and disadvantages of these two upper bounds are thoroughly compared. Beyond the computation of node reliability polynomials, we also estimate the number of cut sets and present a solution to the reliability-based network enhancement problem.</description>

      <title>Reducing Conservativeness of Controlled-Invariant Safe Sets by Introducing a Novel Synthesis of Control Barrier Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a controlled-invariant safe set for a given system with state and control constraints plays an important role in safety-critical systems. Current methods typically produce conservative solutions. In this paper, we introduce a method to generate controlled-invariant safe sets for nonlinear polynomial control-affine dynamical systems by using the notion of Control Barrier Certificates (CBCs). To this end, we relax CBC conditions into Sum of Squares (SOS) constraints, to be solved by an SOS program. We first assume a controlled-invariant safe set (although small) exists for the system. We then propose a method to iteratively enlarge the safe set. We theoretically prove that our method enlarges the safe set in each iteration. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our method through simulated numerical examples in 2D and 3D for single and multi-input dynamical systems and empirically show that our method produces a larger controlled-invariant safe set in these examples, compared to a state-of-the-art technique using Control Barrier Function (CBF).</description>

      <title>Safety Filter Design for Articulated Frame Steering Vehicles In the Presence of Actuator Dynamics Using High-Order Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Articulated Frame Steering (AFS) vehicles are widely used in heavy-duty industries, where they often operate near operators and laborers. Therefore, designing safe controllers for AFS vehicles is essential. In this paper, we develop a Quadratic Program (QP)-based safety filter that ensures feasibility for AFS vehicles with affine actuator dynamics. To achieve this, we first derive the general equations of motion for AFS vehicles, incorporating affine actuator dynamics. We then introduce a novel High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) candidate with equal relative degrees for both system controls. Finally, we design a Parametric Adaptive HOCBF (PACBF) and an always-feasible, QP-based safety filter. Numerical simulations of AFS vehicle kinematics demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Graph Switching for Cyber-Resilient Control in Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed microgrids are conventionally dependent on communication networks to achieve secondary control objectives. This dependence makes them vulnerable to stealth data integrity attacks (DIAs) where adversaries may perform manipulations via infected transmitters and repeaters to jeopardize stability. This paper presents a physics-guided, supervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based framework that identifies communication-level cyberattacks in microgrids by analyzing whether incoming measurements will cause abnormal behavior of the secondary control layer. If abnormalities are detected, an iteration through possible spanning tree graph topologies that can be used to fulfill secondary control objectives is done. Then, a communication network topology that would not create secondary control abnormalities is identified and enforced for maximum stability. By altering the communication graph topology, the framework eliminates the dependence of the secondary control layer on inputs from compromised cyber devices helping it achieve resilience without instability. Several case studies are provided showcasing the robustness of the framework against False Data Injections and repeater-level Man-in-the-Middle attacks. To understand practical feasibility, robustness is also verified against larger microgrid sizes and in the presence of varying noise levels. Our findings indicate that performance can be affected when attempting scalability in the presence of noise. However, the framework operates robustly in low-noise settings.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Traffic Signal Control using High-Dimensional State Representation and Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) traffic signal control (TSC), decisions on the signal timing are made based on the available information on vehicles at a road intersection. This forms the state representation for the RL environment which can either be high-dimensional containing several variables or a low-dimensional vector. Current studies suggest that using high dimensional state representations does not lead to improved performance on TSC. However, we argue, with experimental results, that the use of high dimensional state representations can, in fact, lead to improved TSC performance with improvements up to 17.9% of the average waiting time. This high-dimensional representation is obtainable using the cost-effective vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, encouraging its adoption for TSC. Additionally, given the large size of the state, we identified the need to have computational efficient models and explored model compression via pruning.</description>

      <title>Effects of charging and discharging capabilities on trade-offs between model accuracy and computational efficiency in pumped thermal electricity storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing need for energy storage solutions to balance variable renewable energy sources has highlighted the potential of Pumped Thermal Electricity Storage (PTES). In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs between model accuracy and computational efficiency in PTES systems. We evaluate a range of PTES models, from physically detailed to simplified variants, focusing on their non-linear charging and discharging capabilities. Our results show that while detailed models provide the most accurate representation of PTES operation by considering mass flow rate ($\dot{m}$) and state of charge (SoC) dependencies, they come at the cost of increased computational complexity. In contrast, simplified models tend to produce overly optimistic predictions by disregarding capability constraints. Other approximated model variants offer a practical compromise, balancing computational efficiency with acceptable accuracy. In particular, models that disregard $\dot{m}$-dependency and approximate nonlinear SoC-dependency with a piecewise linear function achieve similar accuracy to more detailed models but with significantly faster computation times. Our findings offer guidance to modelers in selecting the appropriate PTES representation for their investment models.</description>

      <title>Singularity-Avoidance Control of Robotic Systems with Model Mismatch and Actuator Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singularities, manifesting as special configuration states, deteriorate robot performance and may even lead to a loss of control over the system. This paper addresses the kinematic singularity concerns in robotic systems with model mismatch and actuator constraints through control barrier functions (CBFs). We propose a learning-based control strategy to prevent robots entering singularity regions. More precisely, we leverage Gaussian process (GP) regression to learn the unknown model mismatch, where the prediction error is restricted by a deterministic bound. Moreover, we offer the criteria for parameter selection to ensure the feasibility of CBFs subject to actuator constraints. The proposed approach is validated by high-fidelity simulations on a 2 degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) planar robot.</description>

      <title>Iterative Learning Control with Mismatch Compensation for Residual Vibration Suppression in Delta Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unwanted vibrations stemming from the energy-optimized design of Delta robots pose a challenge in their operation, especially with respect to precise reference tracking. To improve tracking accuracy, this paper proposes an adaptive mismatch-compensated iterative learning controller based on input shaping techniques. We establish a dynamic model considering the electromechanical rigid-flexible coupling of the Delta robot, which integrates the permanent magnet synchronous motor. Using this model, we design an optimization-based input shaper, considering the natural frequency of the robot, which varies with the configuration. We proposed an iterative learning controller for the delta robot to improve tracking accuracy. Our iterative learning controller incorporates model mismatch where the mismatch approximated by a fuzzy logic structure. The convergence property of the proposed controller is proved using a Barrier Composite Energy Function, providing a guarantee that the tracking errors along the iteration axis converge to zero. Moreover, adaptive parameter update laws are designed to ensure convergence. Finally, we perform a series of high-fidelity simulations of the Delta robot using Simscape to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Creation of Behavior Models with Variable Modeling Depths Used in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavior models form an integral component of Digital Twins. The specific characteristics of these models may vary depending on the use case. One of these key characteristics is the modeling depth. Behavior models with a lower modeling depth depict the behavior of the asset in an abstract way, while those with a higher modeling depth depict the behavior in detail. Even if very detailed behavior models are flexible and realistic, they also require a lot of resources such as computing power, simulation time and memory requirements. In some applications, however, only limited resources are available. The automated creation of Digital Twins is of crucial importance for their widespread use. Although there are methods for the automated creation of behavior models for Digital Twins with a specific modeling depth, there is currently no method for the automated creation of behavior models with varying modeling depths. This article presents such an approach and demonstrates its advantages using two industrial use cases. It is demonstrated that the automatically created behavior models of lower modeling depth yield results that are almost identical to those of models with a higher modeling depth, but with significantly reduced computing time and required memory. This enables the efficient use of behavior models in a variety of use cases, regardless of the availability of resources.</description>

      <title>Stochastic MPC for Finite Gaussian Mixture Disturbances with Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) algorithm for linear systems subject to additive Gaussian mixture disturbances, with the goal of satisfying chance constraints. To synthesize a control strategy, the stochastic control problem is reformulated into an MPC problem. The reformulation begins by decoupling the mixture distribution and decomposing the system dynamics. Using stochastic simulation relations, we then redefine the stochastic control problem onto the resultant abstract system. Next, constraint tightening forms an MPC problem subject to finite disturbances. A branching control is introduced to solve the MPC problem. Finally, a controller refinement procedure determines a valid control strategy. Our contribution is an extension of the SMPC literature to accommodate Gaussian mixture disturbances while retaining recursive feasibility and closed-loop guarantees. We illustrate the retention of guarantees with a case study of vehicle control on an ill-maintained road.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is revolutionizing the treatment of blood cancers. Mathematical models that can predict the effectiveness of immunotherapies such as CAR T are of increasing interest due to their ability to reduce the number of experiments performed and to guide the theoretical development of new therapeutic strategies. {Following this rationale, we propose the use of control-oriented models to guide the augmentation of CAR T therapy with synthetic gene circuitry. Here we present an initial investigation where we adapt a previously developed CAR T model for control-oriented purposes. We then explore the impact of realistic alternative activation methods as control inputs to ensure effective tumor clearance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Mechanical Ventilators with Learned Respiratory Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciding on appropriate mechanical ventilator management strategies significantly impacts the health outcomes for patients with respiratory diseases. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is one such disease that requires careful ventilator operation to be effectively treated. In this work, we frame the management of ventilators for patients with ARDS as a sequential decision making problem using the Markov decision process framework. We implement and compare controllers based on clinical guidelines contained in the ARDSnet protocol, optimal control theory, and learned latent dynamics represented as neural networks. The Pulse Physiology Engine's respiratory dynamics simulator is used to establish a repeatable benchmark, gather simulated data, and quantitatively compare these controllers. We score performance in terms of measured improvement in established ARDS health markers (pertaining to improved respiratory rate, oxygenation, and vital signs). Our results demonstrate that techniques leveraging neural networks and optimal control can automatically discover effective ventilation management strategies without access to explicit ventilator management procedures or guidelines (such as those defined in the ARDSnet protocol).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving, reduced-order state observer is presented for the unmeasured part of a system's state, where the nonlinear system dynamics exhibit symmetry under the action of a Lie group. The proposed observer takes advantage of this symmetry through the use of a moving frame that constructs invariant mappings of the measurements. Sufficient conditions for the observer to be asymptotically stable are developed by studying the stability of an invariant error system. As an illustrative example, the observer is applied to the problem of rigid-body velocity estimation, which demonstrate how exploiting the symmetry of the system can simplify the stabilization of the estimation error dynamics.</description>

      <title>Degradation mode estimation using reconstructed open circuit voltage curves from multi-year home storage field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A battery's open circuit voltage (OCV) curve can be seen as its electrochemical signature. Its shape and age-related shift provide information on aging processes and material composition on both electrodes. However, most OCV analyses have to be conducted in laboratories or specified field tests to ensure suitable data quality. Here, we present a method that reconstructs the OCV curve continuously over the lifetime of a battery using the operational data of home storage field measurements over eight years. We show that low-dynamic operational phases, such as the overnight household supply with electricity, are suitable for recreating quasi OCV curves. We apply incremental capacity analysis and differential voltage analysis and show that known features of interest from laboratory measurements can be tracked to determine degradation modes in field operation. The dominant degradation mode observed for the home storage systems under evaluation is the loss of lithium inventory, while the loss of active material might be present in some cases. We apply the method to lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), a blend of lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and NMC, and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Field capacity tests validate the method.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Upstream Preemptive Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing myopic pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. Effective signal control, however, inherently requires a broader spatial scope, as traffic conditions further upstream can significantly impact traffic at the current location. This paper introduces a novel concept based on the Markov chain theory, namely multi-hop upstream pressure, that generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the present queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</description>

      <title>Quality of Control based Resource Dimensioning for Collaborative Edge Robotics</title>

Abstract: With the increasing focus on flexible automation, which emphasizes systems capable of adapting to varied tasks and conditions, exploring future deployments of cloud and edge-based network infrastructures in robotic systems becomes crucial. This work, examines how wireless solutions could support the shift from rigid, wired setups toward more adaptive, flexible automation in industrial environments. We provide a quality of control (QoC) based abstraction for robotic workloads, parameterized on loop latency and reliability, and jointly optimize system performance. The setup involves collaborative robots working on distributed tasks, underscoring how wireless communication can enable more dynamic coordination in flexible automation systems. We use our abstraction to optimally maximize the QoC ensuring efficient operation even under varying network conditions. Additionally, our solution allocates the communication resources in time slots, optimizing the balance between communication and control costs. Our simulation results highlight that minimizing the delay in the system may not always ensure the best QoC but can lead to substantial gains in QoC if delays are sometimes relaxed, allowing more packets to be delivered reliably.</description>

      <title>Learned Slip-Detection-Severity Framework using Tactile Deformation Field Feedback for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safely handling objects and avoiding slippage are fundamental challenges in robotic manipulation, yet traditional techniques often oversimplify the issue by treating slippage as a binary occurrence. Our research presents a framework that both identifies slip incidents and measures their severity. We introduce a set of features based on detailed vector field analysis of tactile deformation data captured by the GelSight Mini sensor. Two distinct machine learning models use these features: one focuses on slip detection, and the other evaluates the slip's severity, which is the slipping velocity of the object against the sensor surface. Our slip detection model achieves an average accuracy of 92%, and the slip severity estimation model exhibits a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.6 cm/s for unseen objects. To demonstrate the synergistic approach of this framework, we employ both the models in a tactile feedback-guided vertical sliding task. Leveraging the high accuracy of slip detection, we utilize it as the foundational and corrective model and integrate the slip severity estimation into the feedback control loop to address slips without overcompensating.</description>

      <title>Input-Based Ensemble-Learning Method for Dynamic Memory Configuration of Serverless Computing Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's Function-as-a-Service offerings, a programmer is usually responsible for configuring function memory for its successful execution, which allocates proportional function resources such as CPU and network. However, right-sizing the function memory force developers to speculate performance and make ad-hoc configuration decisions. Recent research has highlighted that a function's input characteristics, such as input size, type and number of inputs, significantly impact its resource demand, run-time performance and costs with fluctuating workloads. This correlation further makes memory configuration a non-trivial task. On that account, an input-aware function memory allocator not only improves developer productivity by completely hiding resource-related decisions but also drives an opportunity to reduce resource wastage and offer a finer-grained cost-optimised pricing scheme. Therefore, we present MemFigLess, a serverless solution that estimates the memory requirement of a serverless function with input-awareness. The framework executes function profiling in an offline stage and trains a multi-output Random Forest Regression model on the collected metrics to invoke input-aware optimal configurations. We evaluate our work with the state-of-the-art approaches on AWS Lambda service to find that MemFigLess is able to capture the input-aware resource relationships and allocate upto 82% less resources and save up to 87% run-time costs.</description>

Abstract: Control system optimization has long been a fundamental challenge in robotics. While recent advancements have led to the development of control algorithms that leverage learning-based approaches, such as SafeOpt, to optimize single feedback controllers, scaling these methods to high-dimensional complex systems with multiple controllers remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based control optimization method, which enhances the additive Gaussian process-based Safe Bayesian Optimization algorithm to efficiently tackle high-dimensional problems through kernel selection. We use PID controller optimization in drones as a representative example and test the method on Safe Control Gym, a benchmark designed for evaluating safe control techniques. We show that the proposed method provides a more efficient and optimal solution for high-dimensional control optimization problems, demonstrating significant improvements over existing techniques.</description>

      <title>$\mathscr{H}_2$ Model Reduction for Linear Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an $\mathscr{H}_2$ norm-based model reduction method for linear quantum systems is presented, which can obtain a physically realizable model with a reduced order for closely approximating the original system. The model reduction problem is described as an optimization problem, whose objective is taken as an $\mathscr{H}_2$ norm of the difference between the transfer function of the original system and that of the reduced one. Different from classical model reduction problems, physical realizability conditions for guaranteeing that the reduced-order system is also a quantum system should be taken as nonlinear constraints in the optimization. To solve the optimization problem with such nonlinear constraints, we employ a matrix inequality approach to transform nonlinear inequality constraints into readily solvable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and nonlinear equality constraints, so that the optimization problem can be solved by a lifting variables approach. We emphasize that different from existing work, which only introduces a criterion to evaluate the performance after model reduction, we guide our method to obtain an optimal reduced model with respect to the $\mathscr{H}_2$ norm. In addition, the above approach for model reduction is extended to passive linear quantum systems. Finally, examples of active and passive linear quantum systems validate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: Emerging distributed generation demands highly reliable and resilient coordinating control in microgrids. To improve on these aspects, spiking neural network is leveraged, as a grid-edge intelligence tool to establish a talkative infrastructure, Spike Talk, expediting coordination in next-generation microgrids without the need of communication at all. This paper unravels the physics behind Spike Talk from the perspective of its distributed infrastructure, which aims to address the Von Neumann Bottleneck. Relying on inferring information via power flows in tie lines, Spike Talk allows adaptive and flexible control and coordination itself, and features in synaptic plasticity facilitating online and local training functionality. Preliminary case studies are demonstrated with results, while more extensive validations are to be included as future scopes of work.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive Safe Robotic Grasping with Tactile Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07833</link>

Abstract: Robotic grasping requires safe force interaction to prevent a grasped object from being damaged or slipping out of the hand. In this vein, this paper proposes an integrated framework for grasping with formal safety guarantees based on Control Barrier Functions. We first design contact force and force closure constraints, which are enforced by a safety filter to accomplish safe grasping with finger force control. For sensory feedback, we develop a technique to estimate contact point, force, and torque from tactile sensors at each finger. We verify the framework with various safety filters in a numerical simulation under a two-finger grasping scenario. We then experimentally validate the framework by grasping multiple objects, including fragile lab glassware, in a real robotic setup, showing that safe grasping can be successfully achieved in the real world. We evaluate the performance of each safety filter in the context of safety violation and conservatism, and find that disturbance observer-based control barrier functions provide superior performance for safety guarantees with minimum conservatism.

      <title>Timer-Based Coverage Control for Mobile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the coverage control problem over a static, compact, and convex workspace and develops a hybrid extension of the continuous-time Lloyd algorithm. Each agent in a multi-agent system (MAS) is equipped with a timer mechanism that generates intermittent measurement and control update events, which may occur asynchronously between agents. Between consecutive event times, as determined by the corresponding timer mechanism, the controller of each agent is held constant. These controllers are shown to drive the configuration of the MAS into a neighborhood of the set of centroidal Voronoi configurations, i.e., the minimizers of the standard locational cost. The combination of continuous-time dynamics with intermittently updated control inputs is modeled as a hybrid system. The coverage objective is posed as a set attractivity problem for hybrid systems, where an invariance-based convergence analysis yields sufficient conditions that ensure maximal solutions of the hybrid system asymptotically converge to a desired set. A brief simulation example is included to showcase the result.</description>

      <title>Small Noise Analysis of Non-Parametric Closed-Loop Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of non-parametric closed-loop identification in frequency domain; we give a brief survey of the literature and provide a small noise analysis of the direct, indirect, and joint input-output methods when two independent experiments with identical excitation are used. The analysis is asymptotic in the noise variance (i.e., as the standard deviation of the innovations $\sigma \to 0$), for a finite data record of length $N$. We highlight the relationship between the estimators accuracy and the loop shape via asymptotic variance expressions given in terms of the sensitivity function. The results are illustrated using a numerical simulation example.</description>

      <title>Local Synchronization of Power System Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel concept of local synchronization of power systems devices based on the difference between the complex frequency of the voltage and current injected at terminals. Formal definitions are provided to account for bounded and asymptotic local synchronization. The definitions are suitable for modern power systems as they remove classical assumptions limiting the application of the concept of synchronization to synchronous machines and omitting voltage dynamics. The paper also provides a systematic analytical description of the synchronization mechanisms of common power system devices. Finally, a variety of examples is included to illustrate the theoretical value and practical application of the proposed definitions to power systems modeling and stability analysis.</description>

      <title>A Review of Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Multi-Agent Frameworks for Distributed Energy Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed energy resources (DERs) are gaining prominence due to their advantages in improving energy efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and enhancing grid resilience. Despite the increasing deployment, the potential of DERs has yet to be fully explored and exploited. A fundamental question restrains the management of numerous DERs in large-scale power systems, "How should DER data be securely processed and DER operations be efficiently optimized?" To address this question, this paper considers two critical issues, namely privacy for processing DER data and scalability in optimizing DER operations, then surveys existing and emerging solutions from a multi-agent framework perspective. In the context of scalability, this paper reviews state-of-the-art research that relies on parallel control, optimization, and learning within distributed and/or decentralized information exchange structures, while in the context of privacy, it identifies privacy preservation measures that can be synthesized into the aforementioned scalable structures. Despite research advances in these areas, challenges remain because these highly interdisciplinary studies blend a wide variety of scalable computing architectures and privacy preservation techniques from different fields, making them difficult to adapt in practice. To mitigate this issue, this paper provides a holistic review of trending strategies that orchestrate privacy and scalability for large-scale power system operations from a multi-agent perspective, particularly for DER control problems. Furthermore, this review extrapolates new approaches for future scalable, privacy-aware, and cybersecure pathways to unlock the full potential of DERs through controlling, optimizing, and learning generic multi-agent-based cyber-physical systems.</description>

      <title>ElectricityEmissions.jl: A Framework for the Comparison of Carbon Intensity Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing number of individuals, companies and organizations are interested in computing and minimizing the carbon emissions associated with their real-time electricity consumption. To achieve this, they require a carbon signal, i.e. a metric that defines the real-time carbon intensity of their electricity supply. Unfortunately, in a grid with multiple generation sources and multiple consumers, there is no unambiguous way to trace electricity from source to sink. This makes it hard to define an appropriate signal, leading to a raging discussion about how to best quantify the carbon footprint of electricity.
  This paper seeks to inform the discussion about which carbon signal is better or more suitable for two important use cases, namely carbon-informed load shifting and carbon accounting. We do this by developing a new software package ElectricityEmissions$.$jl, that computes several established and newly proposed carbon emission metrics for standard electric grid test cases. We also demonstrate how the package can be used to investigate the effects of using these metrics to guide load shifting. Our results affirm previous research, which showed that the choice of carbon emission metric has significant impact on shifting results and associated carbon emission reductions. In addition, we demonstrate the impact of load shifting on both the consumers that perform the shifting and consumers that do not. Disconcertingly, we observe that shifting according to common metrics such as average carbon emissions can reduce the amount of emissions allocated to data center, but cause an increase in the total emissions of the system.</description>

      <title>Skipped Adjacency Pulse Width Modulation: Zero Voltage Switching over Full Duty Cycle Range for Hybrid Flying Capacitor Multi-Level Converters without Dynamic Level Changing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to achieve zero voltage switching (ZVS) across the full duty cycle range in hybrid flying capacitor multilevel (FCML) converters, eliminating the need for dynamic level changing and active re-balancing. Utilizing skipped adjacency pulse width modulation (SAPWM), this approach avoids the nearest pole voltage level, thereby increasing volt-seconds within specific duty cycle range. The method uses a modified PWM scheme, which preserves effective pole voltage by changing duty reference and employing digital logic processing. Simulation results verify the proposed method achieving full-range ZVS. This SAPWM technique is compatible with hybrid FCML converters with various levels, offering enhanced efficiency and reduced switching losses.</description>

      <title>A Deep Recurrent-Reinforcement Learning Method for Intelligent AutoScaling of Serverless Functions</title>

Abstract: FaaS introduces a lightweight, function-based cloud execution model that finds its relevance in a range of applications like IoT-edge data processing and anomaly detection. While cloud service providers offer a near-infinite function elasticity, these applications often experience fluctuating workloads and stricter performance constraints. A typical CSP strategy is to empirically determine and adjust desired function instances or resources, known as autoscaling, based on monitoring-based thresholds such as CPU or memory, to cope with demand and performance. However, threshold configuration either requires expert knowledge, historical data or a complete view of the environment, making autoscaling a performance bottleneck that lacks an adaptable solution. RL algorithms are proven to be beneficial in analysing complex cloud environments and result in an adaptable policy that maximizes the expected objectives. Most realistic cloud environments usually involve operational interference and have limited visibility, making them partially observable. A general solution to tackle observability in highly dynamic settings is to integrate Recurrent units with model-free RL algorithms and model a decision process as a POMDP. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate model-free Recurrent RL agents for function autoscaling and compare them against the model-free PPO algorithm. We explore the integration of a LSTM network with the state-of-the-art PPO algorithm to find that under our experimental and evaluation settings, recurrent policies were able to capture the environment parameters and show promising results for function autoscaling. We further compare a PPO-based autoscaling agent with commercially used threshold-based function autoscaling and posit that a LSTM-based autoscaling agent is able to improve throughput by 18%, function execution by 13% and account for 8.4% more function instances.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control: Closed-loop Guarantees and Scalable Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a collection of closed-loop guarantees and propose a scalable optimization algorithm for distributionally robust model predictive control (DRMPC) applied to linear systems, convex constraints, and quadratic costs. Via standard assumptions for the terminal cost and constraint, we establish distribtionally robust long-term and stage-wise performance guarantees for the closed-loop system. We further demonstrate that a common choice of the terminal cost, i.e., via the discrete-algebraic Riccati equation, renders the origin input-to-state stable for the closed-loop system. This choice also ensures that the exact long-term performance of the closed-loop system is independent of the choice of ambiguity set for the DRMPC formulation. Thus, we establish conditions under which DRMPC does not provide a long-term performance benefit relative to stochastic MPC. To solve the DRMPC optimization problem, we propose a Newton-type algorithm that empirically achieves superlinear convergence and guarantees the feasibility of each iterate. We demonstrate the implications of the closed-loop guarantees and the scalability of the proposed algorithm via two examples. To facilitate the reproducibility of the results, we also provide open-source code to implement the proposed algorithm and generate the figures.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Semantic Communications for Robotic Waypoint Transmission: The Value and Age of Information Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) service of the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication network struggles to support safe robot operation. Nowadays, the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication network is proposed to provide hyper-reliable and low-latency communication to enable safer control for robots. However, current 5G/ 6G research mainly focused on improving communication performance, while the robotics community mostly assumed communication to be ideal. To jointly consider communication and robotic control with a focus on the specific robotic task, we propose goal-oriented semantic communication in robotic control (GSRC) to exploit the context of data and its importance in achieving the task at both transmitter and receiver. At the transmitter, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to generate optimal control and command (C&amp;C) data and a proactive repetition scheme (DeepPro) to increase the successful transmission probability. At the receiver, we design the value of information (VoI) and age of information (AoI) based queue ordering mechanism (VA-QOM) to rank the queue based on the semantic information extracted from AoI and VoI. The simulation results validate that our proposed GSRC framework achieves a 91.5% improvement in the mean square error compared to the traditional unmanned aerial vehicle control framework.</description>

      <title>Compact Model Parameter Extraction via Derivative-Free Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of compact model parameter extraction to simultaneously extract tens of parameters via derivative-free optimization. Traditionally, parameter extraction is performed manually by dividing the complete set of parameters into smaller subsets, each targeting different operational regions of the device, a process that can take several days or weeks. Our approach streamlines this process by employing derivative-free optimization to identify a good parameter set that best fits the compact model without performing an exhaustive number of simulations. We further enhance the optimization process to address three critical issues in device modeling by carefully choosing a loss function that focuses on relative errors rather than absolute errors to ensure consistent performance across different orders of magnitude, prioritizes accuracy in key operational regions above a specific threshold, and reduces sensitivity to outliers. Furthermore, we utilize the concept of train-test split to assess the model fit and avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by successfully modeling a diamond Schottky diode with the SPICE diode model and a GaN-on-SiC HEMT with the ASM-HEMT model. For the latter, which involves extracting 35 parameters for the ASM-HEMT DC model, we identified the best set of parameters in under 6,000 trials. Additional examples using both devices are provided to demonstrate robustness to outliers, showing that an excellent fit is achieved even with over 25% of the data purposely corrupted. These examples demonstrate the practicality of our approach, highlighting the benefits of derivative-free optimization in device modeling.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) currently dominate news headlines. They employ advanced deep learning architectures to extract structural information autonomously from vast datasets through self-supervision. The resulting rich representations of complex systems and dynamics can be applied to many downstream applications. Therefore, FMs can find uses in electric power grids, challenged by the energy transition and climate change. In this paper, we call for the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for electric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the challenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid data and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new approach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty in the electric grid. Finally, we discuss a power grid FM concept, namely GridFM, based on graph neural networks and show how different downstream tasks benefit.</description>

      <title>DistRL: An Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework for On-Device Control Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</description>

      <title>OCMDP: Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many practical applications, decision-making processes must balance the costs of acquiring information with the benefits it provides. Traditional control systems often assume full observability, an unrealistic assumption when observations are expensive. We tackle the challenge of simultaneously learning observation and control strategies in such cost-sensitive environments by introducing the Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process (OCMDP), where the policy influences the observability of the true state. To manage the complexity arising from the combined observation and control actions, we develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy. This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space by focusing on when and what to observe, as well as determining optimal control actions, without requiring knowledge of the environment's dynamics. We validate our approach on a simulated diagnostic task and a realistic healthcare environment using HeartPole. Given both scenarios, the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a substantial reduction in observation costs on average, significantly outperforming baseline methods by a notable margin in efficiency.</description>
