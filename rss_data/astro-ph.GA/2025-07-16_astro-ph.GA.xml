      <title>Emulating Dark Matter Halo Merger Trees with Graph Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merger trees track the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos across cosmic time and serve as essential inputs for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on ad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information. Nguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent neural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of merger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as FLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph structures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on merger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body simulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees with both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced using the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree accurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass and redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate its utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated trees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass relation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly from the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method for generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Absolute Calibration of Cluster Mira Variables to Provide a New Anchor for the Hubble Constant Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mira variables in globular clusters can provide an accurate and precise absolute calibration of their period-luminosity relations (PLRs) to independently anchor the cosmic distance scale and determine the Hubble constant. We present homogeneous near-infrared ($JHK_s$) time-series photometric observations of a sample of 55 candidate long-period variables in 18 globular clusters covering a wide metallicity range ($-1.7 &lt; \textrm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -0.1$ dex). The Gaia proper motions, long-period variability information, and optical-infrared colors are used to identify 41 Oxygen-rich Miras as members of the globular clusters. Mean luminosities of Miras in the $JHK_s$ bands are independently calibrated using the recommended distances and mean parallaxes to their host clusters. Cluster Mira PLRs exhibit scatter comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) variables and do not show any dependence on iron-abundance for a wide range of metallicities. We establish the accuracy of cluster Miras as independent anchors by determining a distance modulus to the LMC, $18.45 \pm 0.04$ mag, in agreement with the 1.2\% precise geometric distance. Our $H$-band photometry is transformed to derive {\it Hubble Space Telescope} F160W PLR for cluster Miras providing a three-anchor baseline with the LMC and NGC 4258. We employ three-anchor solution to determine distances to two type Ia supernovae host galaxies, NGC 1559 ($31.39\pm0.05$ mag) and M101 ($29.07\pm0.04$ mag), and provide a $3.7\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 73.06\pm 2.67$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Similar to Cepheids, our independent baseline solution results in a local $H_0$ determination that is systematically larger than its inference from the early universe probes, further supporting the ongoing Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Little Red Dots in the Local Universe: Signatures of Cool Gas Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift "little red dots" (LRDs) that challenge conventional AGN models. We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1-0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$\alpha$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed "The Egg"), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, Fe II, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.</description>

      <title>WISDOM Project -- XXV. Improving the CO-dynamical supermassive black hole mass measurement in the galaxy NGC 1574 using high spatial resolution ALMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a molecular gas dynamical supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurement in the nearby barred lenticular galaxy NGC 1574, using Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission line with synthesised beam full-widths at half-maximum of $0.''078\times0.''070$ ($\approx7.5\times6.7$ pc$^2$). The observations are the first to spatially resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence (SoI), resulting in an unambiguous detection of the Keplerian velocity increase due to the SMBH towards the centre of the gas disc. We also detect a previously known large-scale kinematic twist of the CO velocity map, due to a position angle (PA) warp and possible mild non-circular motions, and we resolve a PA warp within the central $0.''2\times0.''2$ of the galaxy, larger than that inferred from previous intermediate-resolution data. By forward modelling the data cube, we infer a SMBH mass of $(6.2\pm1.2)\times10^7$ M$_\odot$ ($1\sigma$ confidence interval), slightly smaller than but statistically consistent with the SMBH mass derived from the previous intermediate-resolution data that did not resolve the SoI, and slightly outside the $1\sigma$ scatter of the SMBH mass -- stellar velocity dispersion relation. Our measurement thus emphasises the importance of observations that spatially resolve the SMBH SoI for accurate SMBH mass measurements and gas dynamical modelling.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Based Inference Approach to the Dynamics of the MW-LMC System -- Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has generated dynamical disequilibrium throughout the MW. The interaction has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an apparent 'reflex motion' in velocities of outer halo stars. Often, expensive high fidelity MW--LMC simulations are required to model these effects, though the range of model parameter spaces can be large and complex. We investigate the ability of lower fidelity, rigid MW-LMC simulations to reliably infer the model parameters of higher fidelity N-body and hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in MW--LMC simulations using a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) approach. We produce and release a set of 128,000 MW--LMC rigid potentials, with stellar haloes evolved to present-day, each adopting a unique combination of model parameters including the MW mass, the LMC mass and the dynamical friction strength. For these simulation parameters, we use SBI to find their posterior distributions. We find that our SBI framework trained on rigid MW--LMC simulations is able to correctly infer the true simulation LMC mass within a $1\sigma$ confidence interval from both N-body and cosmological simulations when knowledge of the induced MW reflex motion is provided as data. This motivates future applications of the presented SBI framework to observational data, which will help constrain both MW and LMC properties, as well as the dynamics of the MW's reflex motion.</description>

      <title>Roles of SN and AGN Feedback in Shaping the Baryonic Content in a Wide Range of Dark Matter Halo Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build upon FEGA25 (Contini et al 2025), a previously introduced semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative (suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation), we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25 is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR, YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas ejection in halos with logM_{halo} &lt; approximately 12, while AGN feedback becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model, which activates primarily at late times, redshift &lt; 1, reproduces a characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in intermediate halo mass regimes.</description>

      <title>BASS. XLIX. Characterization of highly luminous and obscured AGNs: local X-ray and [NeV]$\lambda$3426 emission in comparison with the high-redshift Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the most luminous and obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) detected in the ultra-hard X-ray band (14-195 keV) by Swift/BAT. Our sample comprises 21 X-ray luminous (log $L_X/{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}&gt;44.6$, 2-10 keV) AGNs at $z&lt;0.6$, optically classified as Seyfert 1.9-2. Using NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and Chandra, we constrain AGN properties such as absorption column density $N_H$, photon index $\Gamma$, intrinsic $L_X$, covering factor, and iron K$\alpha$ equivalent width. For sources with black hole mass estimates (12/20), we find a weak correlation between $\Gamma$ and Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$). Of these, six ($50\pm13\%$) lie in the $N_H$-$\lambda_{Edd}$ "forbidden region'' and exhibit a combined higher prevalence of $N_H$ variability and outflow signatures, suggesting a transitional phase where AGN feedback may be clearing the obscuring material. For the 13/21 sources with multi-epoch X-ray spectra, $82^{+6}_{-16}\%$ exhibit variability in either 2-10 keV flux ($73^{+9}_{-16}\%$) or line-of-sight $N_H$ ($33^{+15}_{-10}\%$). For the 20/21 sources with available near-UV/optical spectroscopy, we detect [NeV]$\lambda$3426 in 17 ($85^{+5}_{-11}\%$), confirming its reliability to probe AGN emission even in heavily obscured systems. When normalized to the same [OIII]$\lambda$5007 peak flux as $z = 2$-$9$ narrow-line AGNs identified with JWST, our sample exhibits significantly stronger [NeV]$\lambda$3426 emission, suggesting that high-redshift obscured AGNs may be intrinsically weaker in [NeV]$\lambda$3426 or that [NeV]$\lambda$3426 is more challenging to detect in those environments. The sources presented here serve as a benchmark for high-redshift analogs, showing the potential of [NeV]$\lambda$3426 to reveal obscured AGNs and the need for future missions to expand X-ray studies into the high-redshift Universe.</description>

      <title>Structural evolution of quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshift at UV and red rest-frame wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the wavelength dependence of structural parameters for a mass-limited sample ($M_\star&gt;10^{10}M_\odot$) of $\sim27,000$ quiescent galaxies with $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$ using $grizy$ photometry from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam and dense spectroscopy from the HectoMAP survey. Based on S\'ersic profile fits in all five bands, we estimate the circularized half-light radius $R_{e,c}$ and S\'ersic index $n$ in two rest-frames: UV (3500 \r{A}) and red (7000 \r{A}). Combined with $M_\star$, $z$, and D$_n4000$, $R_{e,c}$ and $n$ enable exploration of the evolution in the structural properties - stellar mass correlations for quiescent galaxies with different stellar population ages. At intermediate redshift, quiescent galaxies at all stellar masses show a systematic decline in $R_{e,c}$ and rise in $n$ with rest-frame wavelength. These structural variations are stronger for galaxies that recently joined the quiescent population (newcomers) than for the descendants of galaxies that are already quiescent at the survey limit, $z \sim 0.6$ (aging population). The combined evidence supports inside-out quenching as the dominant mechanism halting star formation during this epoch. The typical size of a $M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ quiescent galaxy increases by $\sim30\%$ between $z \sim 0.6$ and $z \sim 0.2$ in the red and remains constant in the UV; newcomers are $\sim20\%$ larger than the aging population. In the UV, quiescent galaxies maintain a constant $n\sim4$ for the aging population and $n\sim2$ for newcomers; in the red, both subpopulations have de Vaucouleurs profiles. Our findings link newcomers to their direct progenitors in the star-forming population. For the aging population, we suggest minor mergers with progressively redder satellites at lower redshifts as the primary driver of quiescent galaxy evolution. Forthcoming sensitive large-area imaging surveys will allow testing this prediction.</description>

      <title>Insights for Early Massive Black Hole Growth from JWST Detection of the [Ne v] {\lambda}3427 Emission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line detected in the recently published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes in their centers. Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line emission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly complete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z &gt; 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order L_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems is Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH&gt;10^7 M_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated from dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied BH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably higher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the general trend seen in some other z &gt; 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the [Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection of the [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line at z &gt; 5 would translate to similarly high AGN luminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for studying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured sources.</description>

      <title>Fine-structure Line Atlas for Multi-wavelength Extragalactic Study (FLAMES) I: Comprehensive Low and High Redshift Catalogs and Empirical Relations for Probing Gas Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far-infrared (FIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) fine-structure lines (FSLs) are widely used for studying galaxies nearby and faraway. However, interpreting these lines is complicated by factors including sample and data bias, mismatch between resolved calibrations and unresolved observations, limitations in generalizing from case studies, and unresolved issues like the origin of [C II] emission and the so-called ``deficit.''In this series of papers, we assemble and analyze the most comprehensive atlas of FSL data to date. We explore their empirical correlations (paper I), compare them with photoionization models that cover multiphase gas (paper II), and discuss their physical origins and the new perspectives they offer for studying physical properties (paper III). The first paper introduces value-added catalogs of global FSL data of low- and high-z galaxies compiled from the literature, covering most of the existing observations, supplemented with ancillary ultraviolet to FIR information. Our analysis focus on commonly used diagnostics, such as electron density, radiation field strength, metallicity, and electron temperature. We present their distributions across different galaxy samples and redshifts, and cross-validate the reliability of these diagnostics in measuring physical conditions. By examining empirical relations, we identify the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) to the FIR FSLs [O III]88 and [O I]63, and reveal a bias in density measurements. FIR FSLs show good concordance with their optical counterparts. Our findings indicate that variations in FSL ratios are primarily driven by the relative abundances of emitting ions, underscoring their value as tracers of metallicity and radiation field strength. Finally, we compare the FIR FSL properties of low- and high-z galaxies, discussing both their similarities and differences.</description>

      <title>Impact of Cosmic Ray-driven Outflows on Lyman-$\alpha$ Emission in Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) feedback has been proposed as a powerful mechanism for driving warm gas outflows in galaxies. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the impact of CR feedback on neutral hydrogen (HI) in a $10^{11}\,M_\odot$ dark matter halo at $2&lt;z&lt;4$. To this end, we post-process the simulations with ionizing radiative transfer and perform Monte Carlo Lyman-$\alpha$ (Lya) transfer calculations. CR feedback reduces HI column densities around young stars, thereby allowing more Lya photons to escape and consequently offering a better match to the Lya luminosities of observed Lya emitters. Although galaxies with CR-driven outflows have more extended HI in the circumgalactic medium, two Lya line properties sensitive to optical depth and gas kinematics - the location of the red peak in velocity space ($v_\mathrm{red}$) and relative strength of the blue-to-red peaks ($B/R$) - cannot distinguish between the CR-driven and non-CR simulations. This is because Lya photons propagate preferentially along low HI density channels created by the ionizing radiation, thereby limiting the scattering with volume-filling HI. In contrast, the observed low flux ratios between the valley and peak and the surface brightness profiles are better reproduced in the model with CR-driven outflows because the Lya photons interact more before escaping, rather than being destroyed by dust as is the case in the non-CR simulation. We discuss the potential cause of the paucity of sightlines in simulations that exhibit prominent red peaks and large $v_\mathrm{red}$, which may require the presence of more volume-filling HI.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Active Galactic Nuclei Fraction in Cosmic Voids via Mid-Infrared Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations and theoretical simulations suggest that the large scale environment plays a significant role in how galaxies form and evolve and, in particular, whether and when galaxies host an actively accreting supermassive black hole in their center (i.e., an Active Galactic Nucleus, or AGN). One signature of AGN activity is luminosity variability, which appears in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) when circumnuclear dust reprocesses UV and optical photons from the AGN accretion disk. We present here a suite of constraints on the fraction of AGN activity in the most underdense regions of the universe (cosmic voids) relative to the rest of the universe (cosmic walls) by using ~12 years of combined multi-epoch data from AllWISE and NEOWISE to quantify mid-IR variability. We find clear evidence for a larger mid-IR variability-AGN fraction among high and moderate-luminosity void galaxies compared to their wall counterparts. We also show that mid-IR variability identifies a rather large and unique population of AGNs, the majority of which have eluded detection using more traditional AGN-selection methods such as single-epoch mid-IR color selection. The fraction of these newly-recovered AGNs is larger among galaxies in voids, suggesting once again more prolific AGN activity in the most underdense large scale structures of the universe.</description>

      <title>LATIS: A Sample of IGM-selected Protoclusters and Protogroups at $z \sim 2.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS) has produced large 3D maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM), providing a new window on the cosmic web at $z\sim2.5$. A key advantage of Ly$\alpha$ tomography is that it enables the discovery of overdense regions without the need to detect their galaxy members in spectroscopic surveys, circumventing possible selection biases. We use these maps to identify 37 IGM-selected overdensities as regions of strong and spatially coherent Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Simulations indicate that 85% of these are protoclusters, defined as the progenitors of $z=0$ halos with mass $M_{\rm desc} &gt; 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, and that nearly all of the rest are protogroups ($10^{13.5} &lt; M_{\rm desc} / M_{\odot} &lt; 10^{14}$). We estimate the masses and space densities of the IGM-selected overdensities and show they are in accordance with mock surveys. We investigate the LATIS counterparts of some previously reported protoclusters, including the proto-supercluster Hyperion. We identify a new component of Hyperion beyond its previously known extent. We show that the Ly$\alpha$ transmission of the galaxy density peaks within Hyperion is consistent with a simple physical model (the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation), suggesting that active galactic nucleus feedback or other processes have not affected the large-scale gas ionization within this structure as whole. The LATIS catalog represents an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of IGM-selected protogroups and protoclusters and will enable new investigations of the connections between galaxies and their large-scale environments at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>LATIS: Comparing Galaxy and IGM Tomography Maps as Tracers of Large-scale Structure and Protoclusters at $z \sim 2.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the consistency of intergalactic medium (IGM) tomography and galaxy surveys as tracers of the cosmic web and protoclusters at $z \sim 2.5$. We use maps from the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which trace the distributions of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and IGM Ly$\alpha$ absorption on $\simeq 4$ $h^{-1}$ cMpc scales within the same large volume. Overall, the joint distribution of IGM absorption and LBG density is well constrained and accurately described by a simple physical model. However, we identify several exceptional locations exhibiting strong IGM absorption indicative of a massive protocluster, yet no coincident overdensity of LBGs. As discussed by Newman et al., whose results we revise using the complete LATIS survey data, these are candidate ultraviolet (UV)-dim protoclusters that may harbor distinct galaxy populations missed by rest-UV spectroscopic surveys. We present follow-up observations targeting one such candidate embedded within Antu, an extended region of IGM absorption at $z=2.685$ that contains five IGM-selected protoclusters and has a total mass of $3 \times 10^{15}~M_{\odot}$. Ly$\alpha$ emitters trace the overall structure of Antu but avoid the center of the candidate UV-dim protocluster, which also appears to contain no submillimeter-selected sources. A near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy census is needed to determine whether this large region is dominated by galaxies with reduced or absent star-formation activity. This work adds to a growing and puzzling literature on discrepancies among different galaxy and IGM tracers, whose resolution promises to shed light on the early stages of environment-dependent galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>If quasars form from primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of a novel but increasingly well-supported hypothesis that supermassive black holes may have formed from primordial black holes form ed prior to, and rapidly growing in, the radiation-dominated universe. We show that this hypothesis can predict the luminosity of quasars and their luminosity distribution. With reasonable values of the parameters introduced, these predictions are borne out by observations. The model predicts density evolution in accordance with observations. If the same galaxy interaction rate creates quasars and radio galaxies, whose primordial black hole nuclei seem somewhat less massive, their relative number densities reflect relative lifetimes in these states.</description>

      <title>A Lyman continuum analysis for $\sim 100$ galaxies at $z_{\text{spec}} \sim 3$ in the Abell 2744 Cluster Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers at intermediate redshifts is crucial for understanding the properties of cosmic reionizers, as the opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) prevents direct detection of LyC emission from sources during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). In this study, we confirm two new LyC candidate leakers at $z \sim 3$ in the Abell 2744 cluster field, with absolute escape fractions ($f_{\text{esc}}$) of $0.90^{+0.07}_{-0.86}$ and $0.60^{+0.37}_{-0.56}$, respectively. The LyC emission was detected using HST/WFC3/F275W and F336W imaging. These two candidate leakers appear faint ($ M_{\text{UV}} = -18.1 \pm 0.1 \text{ and } -17.81 \pm 0.11$), exhibit blue UV continuum slopes ($\beta = -2.42 \pm 0.05 \text{ and } -1.78 \pm 0.19$), have low masses ($M_\star \sim 10^{7.73} \pm 0.1 \text{ and } 10^{7.07} \pm 0.05 M_\odot$) and show \lya\ equivalent widths of $90 \pm 3$ \AA\ and $28 \pm 12$ \AA, respectively. The discovery of these two LyC candidate leakers was achieved in a catalog of 91 spectroscopically confirmed sources using JWST and/or MUSE public spectra. We also analyze properties that have been proposed as indirect indicators of LyC emission, like \lya, O32 ratio, and $M_\star$: we create subsample of galaxies selected according to such properties, stack the LyC observations of these subsample and assess the limits in escape fractions in the stacks. By analysing the individual candidates and the stacks, in the context of the currently limited sample of known LyC leakers at $z \sim 3$, we aim to enhance our understanding of LyC escape mechanisms and improve our predictions of the LyC $f_{\text{esc}}$ during the EoR.</description>

      <title>Determination of absorption by Q-method for JHK photometry in embedded clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the absorption determination by the Q-method for 2MASS photometry ($J$, $H$ and $K_S$ bands). Using the Pleiades and Praesepe stars, we determine the zero-reddening sequence for different values of the color excess ratios $E(J-H)/E(H-K_S)$. In this paper we consider a sequence consisting of two segments, that leads to an uncertainty in the determining of absorption - one value of the Q parameter corresponds to two values of the non-reddened color index. We propose a method to select a segment of the zero-reddening sequence for the main sequence stars of the cluster. The method is based on the difference in the position of stars of different segments in the cluster luminosity function. To test the proposed method, we simulate the luminosity functions of clusters with the non-uniform absorption distribution in the cluster region. With the typical absorption values in embedded clusters, about 10 % of stars are erroneously assigned, but in some cases this fraction can reach 20 %. Thus, despite the fact that irregular absorption distorts the distribution of stars of different segments on the cluster luminosity function, our method allows to separate stars with an error of no more than 20 %.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method and a corresponding code to compress the color magnitude diagram of a globular cluster into a representative curve, called a ridgeline, that can be more readily compared to isochrone models, among other applications. This compression method preserves the physical properties of the cluster, including the morphology of the CMD.</description>

      <title>Caveats about measuring carbon abundances in stars using the CH band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving accurate carbon abundance estimates for a wide variety of stars is still complex due to the difficulties in properly measuring it from atomic and molecular lines. The aim of this paper is to analyse the carbon abundance determination for the large empirical X-shooter Spectral Library (XSL), commonly used as a benchmark for the development of stellar population models. The analysis was performed over strong molecular CH bands in the G-band region. We used the GAUGUIN automated spectrum synthesis code, and adopted two different grids of reference synthetic spectra separately, each with the same [C/Fe] abundance coverage. We carried out a detailed comparison between both grids to evaluate the accuracy and the model dependence of the measured [C/Fe] abundances. We obtained a large and precise unbiased [C/Fe] abundance catalogue from both theoretical grids, well distributed in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and with no trend with the stellar parameters. We also measured compatible values from each independent CH band, with a high-quality [C/Fe] abundance estimate for both dwarfs and giants indistinctly. We observed a dispersed flat trend around [C/Fe] = 0.0 dex all along the metallicity regime, in agreement with some literature studies. However, we reported variations up to 0.8 dex in the [C/Fe] composition of the star depending on the adopted grid. We did not find such differences in the $\alpha$-element measurements. This behaviour implies a strong model dependence in the [C/Fe] abundance estimate. Potential sources of error could be associated with the use of spectral synthesis methods to derive stellar carbon abundances in the CH4300A band. Intrinsic small differences in the synthetic models over this crowded and blended region may induce a large disparity in the precise abundance estimate for any stellar type, leading to inaccurate carbon measurements without being noticed</description>

      <title>Low-redshift analogues of cosmic noon galaxies as laboratories for clumpy star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been established that a significant fraction of star formation at high-redshift occurs in clumpy galaxies. The properties of clumps and their formation mechanisms, however, remain highly debated. In this work we analyze a sample of 18 Supercompact Ultraviolet Luminous Galaxies observed with the OSIRIS spectrograph at the Keck Telescope, targeting their Pa-alpha emission. These galaxies, although at z~0.1-0.2, share many similar properties with star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon. We find a total of 84 star-forming clumps with typical sizes of a few hundred parsecs. The star-forming clumps exhibit low values of velocity shear (~12 km/s) and high velocity dispersion (~70 km/s). The dynamical masses of the clumps are typically higher than gas masses inferred from the measured star-formation rates of each clump. We also artificially redshift our data to emulate observations at z=2.2 and allow for a direct comparison with other galaxies at higher redshift. Our results indicate that, due to the effects of clump clustering and low-resolution observations, high-z clumps appear larger at greater cosmological distances. This underscores the importance of using low-redshift observations to anchor studies at earlier epochs. Finally, our results support the idea of growing clump sizes in star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, although not to scales of kpc as found by other works without the benefits of adaptive optics or gravitational lensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated empirical background images for JWST/NIRISS Wide-Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) for both orthogonal grisms (GR150C, GR150R) crossed with all NIRISS WFSS wide-band filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W). The background images are created using carefully vetted science and calibration exposures and improve the quality of previous background reference files. We present our methodology to create the background images and assess their quality using background subtracted science data. Overall, background residuals reach below 1% of the sky brightness for all filter and grism combinations, corresponding to a decrease in the background RMS of a factor of up to 7 from previous background reference files. The new background images are available on the Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS) as of context 1365 and we recommend using them for improved quality of NIRISS WFSS data.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Cosmic-Ray Transport in High-Resolution Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) through a simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at unprecedented resolution of $10{,}240^3$. We drive turbulence that is subsonic and super-Alfv\'enic, characterized by $\delta B_{\rm rms}/B_0=2$. The high resolution enables an extended inertial range such that the Alfv\'en scale $l_A$, where $\delta B (l_A)\approx B_0$, is well resolved. This allows us to properly capture how the cascade transitions from large amplitudes on large scales to small amplitudes on small scales. We find that sharp bends in the magnetic field are key mediators of particle transport even on small scales via resonant curvature scattering. We further find that particle scattering in the turbulence shows strong hints of self-similarity: (1) the diffusion has weak energy dependence over almost two decades in particle energy and (2) the particles' random walk exhibits a broad power-law distribution of collision times such that the diffusion is dominated by the rarest, long-distance excursions. Our results suggest that large-amplitude MHD turbulence can provide efficient scattering over a wide range of CR energies and may help explain many CR observations above a $\sim$TeV: the flattening of the B/C spectrum, the hardening of CR primary spectra and the weak dependence of arrival anisotropy on CR energy.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning inference of stellar properties using integrated photometric and spectroscopic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar astrophysics relies on diverse observational modalities-primarily photometric light curves and spectroscopic data-from which fundamental stellar properties are inferred. While machine learning (ML) has advanced analysis within individual modalities, the complementary information encoded across modalities remains largely underexploited. We present DESA (Dual Embedding model for Stellar Astrophysics), a novel multi-modal foundation model that integrates light curves and spectra to learn a unified, physically meaningful latent space for stars. DESA first trains separate modality-specific encoders using a hybrid supervised/self-supervised scheme, and then aligns them through DualFormer, a transformer-based cross-modal integration module tailored for astrophysical data. DualFormer combines cross- and self-attention, a novel dual-projection alignment loss, and a projection-space eigendecomposition that yields physically structured embeddings. We demonstrate that DESA significantly outperforms leading unimodal and self-supervised baselines across a range of tasks. In zero- and few-shot settings, DESA's learned representations recover stellar color-magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams with high fidelity ($R^2 = 0.92$ for photometric regressions). In full fine-tuning, DESA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for binary star detection (AUC = $0.99$, AP = $1.00$) and stellar age prediction (RMSE = $0.94$ Gyr). As a compelling case, DESA naturally separates synchronized binaries from young stars, two populations with nearly identical light curves, purely from their embedded positions in UMAP space, without requiring external kinematic or luminosity information. DESA thus offers a powerful new framework for multimodal, data-driven stellar population analysis, enabling both accurate prediction and novel discovery.</description>

      <title>Effect of Galactic Chemical Evolution on Exoplanet Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We couple a simplified model for the galactic chemical evolution, with software that models the condensation of dust in protoplanetary disks and software that models the interior structure of planets in order to estimate the effects that the galactic chemical evolution has on the properties of planets as they form over time. We find that the early abundance of elements formed from the evolution and death of high-mass stars (such as Oxygen, Silicon, and Magnesium) yields planets with larger mantles and smaller cores. The later addition of elements produced in low-mass stars (such as Iron and Nickel) causes the planet cores to become relatively larger. The result is planets that orbit older stars are less dense than planets orbiting younger stars. These results are broadly consistent with recent observations of planet properties from stars of varying ages.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone project. III. ALMA synthetic observations of fragmentation in high-mass star-forming clumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical mechanisms that regulate the collapse of high-mass parsec-scale clumps and allow them to form clusters of new stars represent a crucial aspect of star formation. To investigate these mechanisms, we developed the Rosetta Stone project: an end-to-end (simulations-observations) framework that is based on the systematic production of realistic synthetic observations of clump fragmentation and their comparison with real data. In this work, we compare ALMA 1.3mm continuum dust emission observations from the SQUALO survey with a new set of 24 radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of high-mass clump fragmentation, post-processed using the CASA software to mimic the observing strategy of SQUALO. The simulations were initialized combining typical values of clump mass (500,1000 solar masses) and radius (~0.4pc) with two levels of turbulence (Mach number of 7,10) and three levels of magnetization (mass-to-flux ratio of ~3,10,100). Following the clump evolution over time with two random seeds projected along three orthogonal directions, we produced a collection of 732 synthetic fields. The synthetic observations of clump fragmentation at ~7000AU revealed between 2 and 14 fragments per field. Among the initial conditions of the simulations, magnetic fields have the largest impact on the fragment multiplicity at these scales. In advanced stages of clump evolution, a lower number of fragments is preferentially associated with magnetized clumps. Fragments identified at ~7000AU correspond to individual or multiple sink particles in ~75% of the cases, suggesting that not all fragments are actively forming stars. Both sinks and fragments accrete mass throughout the whole clump evolution, favoring a scenario in which fragments are not isolated from the environment. Our study demonstrates the importance of synthetic observations in interpreting results from interferometric observations.</description>

      <title>Disk Instability Model for Quasi-Periodic Eruptions: Investigating Period Dispersion and Peak Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a class of X-ray repeating burst phenomena discovered in recent years. Many models have been proposed to study this phenomenon, there remains significant debate regarding the physical origin of QPEs. In our previous work, we developed a disk instability model with a large-scale magnetic field and successfully reproduced the light curves and spectral characteristics of several QPE sources. We further investigate the model in this work, aiming to explain two key observational features: the dispersion in eruption periods and the peak temperatures during eruptions. The model reveals critical thresholds ($\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$, $\beta_{1,\rm crit}$) that separate systems into stable regimes with minimal period variations and unstable regimes where periods are highly sensitive to accretion rate and magnetic field parameter, while peak temperatures remain nearly constant across the parameter space. This framework successfully explains both the regular eruptions observed in sources like GSN 069 and the stochastic behavior in sources like eRO-QPE1, and simultaneously accounting for the observed temperature stability during long-term QPEs evolution.</description>

      <title>Emulating CO Line Radiative Transfer with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling carbon monoxide (CO) line radiation is computationally expensive for traditional numerical solvers, especially when applied to complex, three-dimensional stellar atmospheres. We present COEmuNet, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based surrogate model that emulates CO line radiation transport with high accuracy and efficiency. It consists of an asymmetric encoder-decoder design that takes 3D hydrodynamical models as inputs and generates synthetic observations of evolved stellar atmospheres. The model is trained on data from hydrodynamic simulations of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars perturbed by a companion. Given a set of input parameters, including velocity fields, kinetic temperature distribution, and CO molecular number densities, the COEmuNet model emulates spectral line observations with a median relative error of ~7% compared to a classical numerical solver of the radiative transfer equation, measured over seven frequency channels and arbitrary viewing directions. Besides, COEmuNet delivers a 1000 times speedup, enabling efficient model fitting to observational datasets, real-time visualization of simulations and progress toward integration in large-scale cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic alignment demographics for next-generation lensing: Revealing galaxy property trends with DESI Y1 direct measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present direct measurements of the intrinsic alignments (IA) of over 2 million spectroscopic galaxies using DESI Data Release 1 and imaging from four lensing surveys: DES, HSC, KiDS, and SDSS. In this uniquely data-rich regime, we take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building a library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and redshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame colour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate -- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with zero, across low (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.5) and high (0.8&lt;z&lt;1.55) redshifts. In order to construct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain maximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment with colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the amplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated with stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between 0&lt;z&lt;1.5, trends in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments we measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion paper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA signals with significant detections, including model comparison. Finally, to direct efforts for future IA measurements, we juxtapose the colour-magnitude-redshift coverage of existing IA measurements against modern and future lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Joint Modeling of Quasar Variability and Accretion Disk Reprocessing using Latent Stochastic Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasars are bright active galactic nuclei powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. Their stochastic brightness variability depends on the physical properties of the accretion disk and black hole. The upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to observe tens of millions of quasars, so there is a need for efficient techniques like machine learning that can handle the large volume of data. Quasar variability is believed to be driven by an X-ray corona, which is reprocessed by the accretion disk and emitted as UV/optical variability. We are the first to introduce an auto-differentiable simulation of the accretion disk and reprocessing. We use the simulation as a direct component of our neural network to jointly model the driving variability and reprocessing, trained with supervised learning on simulated LSST-like 10 yr quasar light curves. We encode the light curves using a transformer encoder, and the driving variability is reconstructed using latent stochastic differential equations, a physically motivated generative deep learning method that can model continuous-time stochastic dynamics. By embedding the physical processes of the driving signal and reprocessing into our network, we achieve a model that is more robust and interpretable. We demonstrate that our model outperforms a Gaussian process regression baseline and can infer accretion disk parameters and time delays between wave bands, even for out-of-distribution driving signals. Our approach provides a powerful framework that can be adapted to solve other inverse problems in multivariate time series.</description>

      <title>Lack of Bulge Alignment in Late-type Galaxies with Large-scale Filaments Plausibly Unveils a Radial Migration Formation Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation sequence of bulges and disks in late-type galaxies (LTGs) remains debated. While some theories suggest bulges form before disks, others propose the reverse. To address this, we analyze a bulge+disk decomposition catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, examining the alignment between central bulge major axes and large-scale filaments. For LTGs near filament spines, no significant alignment is found. However, LTGs farther from filaments show a marginal ($\sim 1\sigma$) perpendicular alignment. Notably, central bulges and outer disks exhibit strong alignment in the sky plane, suggesting bulge formation may be driven by material migration from outer disks. Although further simulations are needed, our results provide a novel alignment-based perspective on bulge formation, advancing understanding of galactic structural evolution.</description>

      <title>Importance of modelling the nebular continuum in galaxy spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neglect of modelling both stellar and nebular emission significantly affects the derived physical properties of galaxies, particularly those with high star formation rates. While this issue has been studied, it has not been established a clear threshold for a significant impact on the estimated physical properties of galaxies due to accounting for both stellar and nebular emission. We analyse galaxies from SDSS-DR7 across a wide range of star-forming activity levels, comparing the results obtained from two spectral fitting tools: FADO (which considers both stellar and nebular continuum) and STARLIGHT (only considers the stellar continuum). A strong linear correlation is found between the rest-frame H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ equivalent widths (EWs) and the optical nebular contribution, identifying these as reliable tracers. The results show that when the nebular contribution exceeds 8% (corresponding to EW(H$\alpha$)$\simeq$500 \r{A} and EW(H$\beta$)$\simeq$110 \r{A}), there is a significant impact on the estimation of galaxy properties, namely stellar mass, age and metallicity. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account both the stellar and nebular continuum when analysing the optical spectra of star-forming galaxies. In particular, this is a fundamental aspect for galaxies with a rest-frame EW(H$\alpha$)$\gtrsim$500 \r{A} (or the scaled value of 375 \r{A} for pseudo-continuum measures). At low redshifts, this mostly impacts extreme emission line galaxies, while at higher redshifts it becomes a dominant aspect given the higher star-forming activity in the younger Universe. In light of current JWST observations and future instruments designed for high-redshift observations, such as MOONS, this reveals as a critical issue to take into consideration.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Cool Gas Clouds in M82's Starburst-Driven Outflow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star formation feedback can drive large-scale, multi-phase galactic outflows. The dynamical and thermodynamical interaction between the hot and cooler phases is a prime focus of both observational and theoretical work. Here, we analyze H$\alpha$-emitting structures in the extraplanar wind of the nearby starburst M82. We use high-resolution, narrow-band, observations from the Hubble Legacy Archive (Mutchler et al. 2007). Our analysis constrains the morphology, number density, and column density of the structures. We highlight conspicuous arc-like structures that differ significantly from the linear cometary clouds that emerge from galactic wind simulations and discuss their possible origins, such as bow shocks or instabilities driven by cosmic rays. The most prominent structures range in size from $\sim24 -110$ pc. Using the H$\alpha$ brightness and assumptions about the depth of the emitting structures, we estimate number densities of $\sim1-23$ cm$^{-3}$ assuming a unity volume filling factor, which are lower than previous constraints from spectroscopic nebular line studies. The derived column densities, $\sim10^{20}-10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, along the path of the outflow are above theoretical thresholds for cool cloud survival in a hot supersonic background, but small enough that the structures could be accelerated by the hot wind momentum. Using diffuse X-ray emission maps from $\textit{Chandra}$, we also find that even on small ($\sim100$ pc) scales, the H$\alpha$ "leads" the X-rays, a behavior long noted in the literature on kiloparsec scales, and one we observe in the brightness profiles of the structures we analyze. This behavior, along with previous observational studies of ionization in the wind, may signal that shock ionization is responsible for the H$\alpha$ emission we observe.</description>

      <title>Addressing the core-cusp and diversity problem of dwarf and disk galaxies using cold collisionless DARKexp theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are observed to have linearly rising rotation curves, which indicate constant density cores in their centers. These do not arise naturally from dark matter only simulations, giving rise to the ``core-cusp'' problem. Hydrodynamic simulations incorporating baryonic feedback can create cored profiles, but this solution requires some fine tuning. Additionally, there is a related ``diversity'' problem in which simulations cannot reproduce the large range in rotation curve shapes for galaxies of similar mass. Here we investigate, for the first time, whether a theoretical model based on statistical mechanics (DARKexp) can produce flat density cores with its single shape parameter. We find that these theoretical profiles are able to fit the observed rotation curves of galaxies with last measured velocities in the range ~ 20-200 km/s by producing fits to 96 SPARC catalog galaxies covering this range. We additionally show that the projected stellar density distributions of ultrafaint dwarfs that show cores are also well fit, and that wave, or fuzzy dark matter is unable to fit the full range of SPARC galaxies. Thus, DARKexp appears to be able to address the core-cusp problem and the diversity of rotation curves in these dark matter dominated galaxies with cold collisionless dark matter alone, i.e., without introducing baryonic feedback, or alternative nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transfer Simulations of Ly$\alpha$ Intensity Mapping During Cosmic Reionization Including Sources from Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new simulations of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) intensity maps that include Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and all significant sources of Ly$\alpha$ photons. The sources considered include Ly$\alpha$ directly from galaxies, cooling at the edges of ionized bubbles, recombinations within these bubbles, and reprocessing of galaxy continuum emission in the IGM. We also vary astrophysical parameters including the average neutral fraction of the IGM, the dust absorption of Ly$\alpha$ in galaxies, and the ionizing escape fraction. Previous work has suggested that Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping can be used to constrain the neutral fraction of the IGM when accounting for radiative transfer in the IGM. When radiative transfer is ignored, direct Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies has the highest amplitude of power on all scales. When we include radiative transfer in our simulations, we find continuum emission reprocessed as Ly$\alpha$ is comparable to the Ly$\alpha$ emission directly from galaxies on large scales. For high neutral fraction in the IGM, emission from recombinations is comparable to galaxies on large scales. We find that the slope of the power spectrum is sensitive to the neutral fraction of the IGM when radiative transfer is included, suggesting that this may be useful for placing constraints on cosmic reionization. In addition, we find the power of galaxies is decreased across all scales due to dust absorption. We also find the escape fraction must be large for recombinations and bubble edges to contribute significantly to the power. We find the cross power is observable between SPHEREx Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps and a hypothetical galaxy survey is observable with a total signal-to-noise of 4 from $k = 0.035$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to $k = 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA). II. The age-metallicity relation of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the age determination of 13 globular clusters dynamically associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger event, as part of the CARMA project effort to trace the Milky Way assembly history. We used deep and homogeneous archival $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ data, and applied isochrone-fitting to derive homogeneous age estimates. We find that the majority of the selected clusters form a well-defined age-metallicity relation, with a few outliers. Among these, NGC 288 and NGC 6205 are more than 2 Gyr older than the other GSE globular clusters at similar metallicity, and are therefore interpreted as of likely in-situ origin. Moreover, NGC 7099 is somewhat younger than the average GSE trend, this suggesting a possible alternative dwarf galaxy progenitor, while NGC 5286 is mildly older, as if its progenitor was characterised by an higher star-formation efficiency. Another remarkable feature of the resulting age-metallicity relation is the presence of two epochs of globular cluster formation, with a duration of $\sim0.3$ Gyr each and separated by $\sim2$ Gyr. These findings are in excellent agreement with the age-metallicity relation of halo field stars found by Gonz\'alez-Koda et al., clearly hinting at episodic star-formation in GSE. The age of the two formation epochs is similar to the mean age of the two groups of in-situ globular clusters previously studied by CARMA. These epochs might therefore be precisely pinpointing two important dynamical events that GSE had with the Milky Way during its evolutionary history. Finally, we discuss the correlation between the recent determination of Si and Eu with the clusters age and origin.</description>

      <title>Dynamical streams in the local stellar halo</title>

Abstract: Co-moving groups of stars (streams) are well known in the velocity space of the disc near the Sun. Many are thought to arise from resonances with the Galactic bar or spiral arms. In this work, we search for similar moving groups in the velocity space of the halo, at low angular momentum. From the asymmetry of the radial velocity distribution $v_R$, we identify two inward-moving streams with $v_R&lt;0$ and small $|v_\phi|$. These are projections of the `chevrons' previously discovered in radial phase space $(R,v_R)$. A test particle simulation in a realistic Milky Way potential with a decelerating bar naturally produces analogues of these features, and they are observed across a wide range of metallicity. They are therefore very likely to be dynamical streams created by trapping in the bar's resonances. Specifically, they occupy regions of phase space where orbits are trapped in the corotation and outer Lindblad resonances respectively. By tracing these streams across a range of radii in $(R,v_R)$ space, we fit resonant orbits to their tracks in a flexible potential with variable bar pattern speed. This allows us to simultaneously constrain the mass profile of the Milky Way for $r\lesssim20$ kpc and the pattern speed $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. We estimate the mass enclosed within $r=20$ kpc to be $M_{20}=(2.17\pm0.21)\times10^{11}M_\odot$, and the pattern speed to be $\Omega_\mathrm{b}=31.9_{-1.9}^{+1.8}$ km/s/kpc. Our fitted potential is in excellent agreement with previous results, while we favour a slightly slower pattern speed than most recent estimates.</description>

      <title>Assessing differences between local galaxy dust attenuation and point source extinction within the same environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dust attenuation in galaxies has often been used as a proxy for the extinction of point sources, such as supernovae, even though this approach ignores fundamental differences between the two cases. We present an analysis of the impact of geometric effects and scattering within dusty media on recovered galaxy dust properties. We use SKIRT, a radiative transfer code, to simulate observations of point sources embedded in dust clouds, as well as spiral and elliptical galaxies. We examine various galaxy morphologies, inclinations, and instrument apertures. We find that in galaxies the scattering of light into the line of sight and the presence of sources at different depths within the galaxy make attenuation fundamentally different from extinction. For a medium with intrinsic extinction slope Rv=3.068, we recover effective attenuation slopes Rv_e ranging from 0.5 to 7, showing that the two quantities are not analogous, even for local resolved observations. We find that Rv_e greatly depends on dust density, galaxy morphology, and inclination, the latter being the most significant. A single simulated galaxy, viewed from different angles, can reproduce the well-known relation between attenuation strength Av_e and Rv_e observed for star-forming galaxy samples. An increase in dust density leads to higher Rv_e across all inclinations, which, assuming a correlation between stellar mass and dust density, explains the increase in Rv_e with mass observed in star-forming galaxies. However, we are unable to explain the differences in Rv_e between star-forming and quiescent high-mass galaxies. We conclude that highly attenuated regions of simulated face-on galaxies yield Rv_e within 10% of the intrinsic extinction slope of the medium, allowing for the distinction of different dust types. For edge-on spirals, however, the median Rv_e for low Av_e regions appears to better approximate the extinction slope.</description>

      <title>A remarkable Ruby: Absorption in dense gas, rather than evolved stars, drives the extreme Balmer break of a Little Red Dot at $z=3.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as `little red dots' (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at $z=3.55$ with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high-redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (H$\alpha\ \rm FWHM\sim1500$km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size ($M_*\sim10^{10.5}\,M_\odot,\ r_{e}\sim40\,$pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H$\alpha$ absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.</description>

      <title>Core collapse in resonant self-interacting dark matter across two decades in halo mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core collapse, a process associated with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, can increase the central density of halos by orders of magnitude with observable consequences for dwarf galaxy properties and gravitational lensing. Resonances in the self-interaction cross section, features of hidden-sector models with light mediators and attractive potentials, can boost the strength of self-interactions near specific relative velocities, accelerating collapse in halos with central velocity dispersions near the resonance. To explore this phenomenon, we present a suite of idealized N-body simulations of isolated halos with masses $10^7$-$10^9 \ \rm{M_\odot}$ evolved under two resonant cross section (RCS) models with localized enhancement to the cross section on scales $v \sim 5$-$50 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$. We show that the change in halo internal structure depends on how the velocity distribution of bound particles moves across resonances in the cross section during core formation and collapse. The interplay between the velocity distribution of bound particles and localized features of the cross section causes deviations from self-similar evolution, a characteristic of velocity-independent cross sections, at the level of up to $20\%$. Depending on the alignment with resonant features, halos of different masses reach different evolutionary stages after a fixed physical time and develop diverse density profiles and rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Massive Black Hole Seed Formation in Strong X-ray Environments at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promissing pathway for forming supermassive black holes (BHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) cooling during primordial star formation via intense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in overdense regions. However, non-detection of 21 cm signals from the EoR reported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests that such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local universe, promoting H$_2$ production and thereby potentially quenching massive BH seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model incorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong X-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct collapse and leads most halos to experience H$_2$ cooling. Nevertheless, massive BH seeds with $M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^4~M_\odot$ still form by $z\simeq 15$, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their abundance reaches $\sim 10^{-4}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ sufficient to explain the SMBHs identified by JWST spectroscopy at $3&lt;z&lt;6$. While the formation of highly overmassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by X-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of $\simeq 0.01-0.1$ were already established at seeding.</description>

      <title>A disturbance in the force. How force fluctuations hinder dynamical friction and induce core stalling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical friction is an important phenomena in stellar dynamics resulting in the slowing down of a test particle upon many two-body scatters with background particles. Chandrasekhar's original formulation, developed for idealized infinite and homogeneous systems, has been found to be sufficiently accurate even in models of finite extent and radially dependent density profiles. However, in some cases $N-$body simulations evidenced a breakdown of Chandrasekhar's formalism. In particular, in the case of cored stellar systems, the analytical predictions underestimate the rate of in-fall of the test particle. Several explanations for such discrepancy have been proposed so far, in spite of this it remains unclear whether the origin is a finite N effect or an effect arising from the resonance of the orbits of the test and field particles, which is independent on $N$, such as dynamical buoyancy. Here we aim at shedding some light on this issue with tailored numerical experiments. We perform ad hoc simulations of a massive tracer initially placed on a low eccentricity orbit in spherical equilibrium models with increasing resolution. We use an $N-$body code where the self-consistent interaction among the background particles can be substituted with the effect of the static smooth potential of the system's continuum limit, so that the higher order contributions to the dynamical friction arising from the formation of a wake can be neglected if needed. We find that, contrary to what reported in the previous literature, a suppression of dynamical friction happens in both cuspy and cored models. When neglecting the interaction among field particles we observe in both cases a clear $N^{-1/2}$ scaling of the radius at which dynamical friction ceases to be effective. This hints towards a granularity-induced origin of the so-called core-stalling of the massive tracer in cored models.</description>

      <title>Formation of Supersonic Turbulence in the Primordial Star-forming Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new simulations of the formation and evolution of the first star-forming cloud within a massive minihalo of mass of $1.05 \times 10^7\, M_{\odot}$, carried out using the GIZMO code with detailed modeling of primordial gas cooling and chemistry. Unlike previous studies that simulated the formation of the first stars within a smaller cosmological boxsize of $\sim 1-2$ Mpc, our work adopts initial conditions from the large-scale cosmological simulations, IllustrisTNG spanning $\sim 50$ Mpc to study the formation of primordial clouds that give birth to the first stars. We increase the original resolution of IllustrisTNG by a factor of $\sim10^5$ using a particle-splitting technique, achieving an extremely high resolution that allows us to resolve turbulence driven by gravitational collapse during early structure formation. We find that strong supersonic turbulence with a characteristic Mach number of $\sim 5.2$ naturally develops within the collapsing halo. This turbulence efficiently stirs the gas, promoting fragmentation of the star-forming cloud into multiple dense clumps. Among them, we identify a gravitationally bound core with a mass of $8.07\,M_{\odot}$ and a size of $0.03$ pc, which exceeds its local Jeans mass and is on the verge of collapsing into a star. Our results indicate that supersonic turbulence may be common in primordial halos and can play a crucial role in cloud-scale fragmentation, potentially lowering the characteristic mass scale of the first stars.</description>

      <title>Wind-fed Supermassive Black Hole Accretion by the Nuclear Star Cluster: the Case of M31*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the Andromeda galaxy, known as M31*, exhibits dim electromagnetic emission and is inferred to have an extremely low accretion rate for its remarkable mass ($\sim10^8~\rm~M_\odot$). In this work, we use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore a previously untested scenario, in which M31* is fed by the collective stellar mass-loss from its surrounding nuclear star cluster, manifested as a famous eccentric disk of predominantly old stellar populations. The stellar mass-loss is assumed to be dominated by the slow and cold winds from 100 asymptotic giant-branch stars, which follow well-constrained Keplerian orbits around M31* and together provide a mass injection rate of $\sim4\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$. The simulations achieve a quasi-steady state on a Myr timescale, at which point a quasi-Keplerian, cool ($T\sim10^3-10^4~\rm K$) gas disk extending several parsecs is established. This disk is continuously supplied by the stellar winds and itself feeds the central SMBH. At the end of the simulations at 2 Myr, an accretion rate of $\sim2\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$ is found but could vary by a factor of few depending on whether the subdominant gravity of the NSC or a moderate global inflow is included. The predicted X-ray luminosity of $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, dominated by the hot ($T\sim10^7-10^8~\rm K$) plasma within 0.2 parsec of the SMBH, is well consistent with Chandra observations. We conclude that the feeding mechanism of M31* is successfully identified, which has important implications for the working of dormant SMBHs prevalent in the local universe.</description>

      <title>The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping Survey: VIII. Galactic Chemical Gradient and Azimuthal Analysis from SDSS/MWM DR19</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to curate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member stars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM survey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has established a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to constrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster sample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other large-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate considerably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial [Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's current Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \pm 0.005$ dex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not find strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element gradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Na, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have sufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In this work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial abundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.</description>

      <title>Zero-polarization candidate regions for calibration of wide-field optical polarimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Calibration of optical polarimeters relies on the use of stars with negligible polarization (unpolarized standard stars) for determining the instrumental polarization zero-point. For wide-field polarimeters, calibration is often done by imaging the same star over multiple positions in the field of view - a process which is time-consuming. A more effective technique is to target fields containing multiple standard stars. While this method has been used for fields with highly polarized stars, there are no such sky regions with well-measured unpolarized standard stars. Aims. We aim to identify sky regions with tens of stars exhibiting negligible polarization, which are suitable for zero-point calibration of wide-field polarimeters. Methods. We selected stars in regions with extremely low reddening, located at high Galactic latitudes. We targeted four ~ 400 x 400 fields in the northern, and eight in the southern Equatorial hemisphere. Observations were carried out at the Skinakas Observatory and the South African Astronomical Observatory respectively. Results. We find two fields in the North and seven in the South with mean polarization lower than p &lt; 0.1%. Conclusions. At least nine out of twelve fields can be used for zero-point calibration of wide-field polarimeters.</description>

      <title>Gas-induced perturbations on the gravitational wave in-spiral of live post-Newtonian LISA massive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $55$ to $49$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also report the gas-induced orbital dephasing $\delta \phi_{\rm orb}\sim-0.007$ rad over $278$ orbital cycles that is likely driven mainly by disc-induced precession and LISA should be able to detect it at redshift $z=1$. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications for multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

Abstract: A persistent challenge in astronomical machine learning is a systematic bias where predictions compress the dynamic range of true values-high values are consistently predicted too low while low values are predicted too high. Understanding this bias has important consequences for astronomical measurements and our understanding of physical processes in astronomical inference. Through analytical examination of linear regression, we show that this bias arises naturally from measurement uncertainties in input features and persists regardless of training sample size, label accuracy, or parameter distribution. In the univariate case, we demonstrate that attenuation becomes important when the ratio of intrinsic signal range to measurement uncertainty ($\sigma_{\text{range}}/\sigma_x$) is below $O(10)$-a regime common in astronomy. We further extend the theoretical framework to multivariate linear regression and demonstrate its implications using stellar spectroscopy as a case study. Even under optimal conditions-high-resolution APOGEE-like spectra ($R=24,000$) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR=100) and multiple correlated features-we find percent-level bias. The effect becomes even more severe for modern-day low-resolution surveys like LAMOST and DESI due to the lower SNR and resolution. These findings have broad implications, providing a theoretical framework for understanding and addressing this limitation in astronomical data analysis with machine learning.</description>

      <title>The visibility of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model in LSST</title>

Abstract: With a new probabilistic technique for sampling interstellar object (ISO) orbits with high efficiency, we assess the observability of ISOs under a realistic cadence for the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Using the \={O}tautahi-Oxford population model, we show that there will be complex on-sky structure in the pattern of direction and velocity revealed by the detected ISO population, with the expected enhanced northern flux complicating efforts to derive population parameters from the LSST's predominately southern footprint. For luminosity functions with slopes of $2.5\leq q_s\leq 4.0$, the most discoverable ISOs have $H_r\simeq 14.6-20.7$; for previously estimated spatial densities, between 6 and 51 total ISOs are expected. The slope of the luminosity function of ISOs will be relatively quickly constrained. Discoveries are evenly split around their perihelion passage and are biased to lower velocities. After their discovery by LSST, it will be rare for ISOs to be visible for less than a month; most will have $m_r \leq 23$ for months, and the window for spectroscopic characterization could be as long as two years. These probabilistic assessments are robust against model or spatial density refinements that change the absolute numbers of ISO discoveries.</description>

      <title>A systematic method to identify runaways from star clusters produced from single-binary interactions: A case study of M67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06252</link>

Abstract: One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of $10^8$ pairs.</description>
