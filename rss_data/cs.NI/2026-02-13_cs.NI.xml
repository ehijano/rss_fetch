      <title>GORGO: Maximizing KV-Cache Reuse While Minimizing Network Latency in Cross-Region LLM Load Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributing LLM inference across geographical regions can improve Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by regionalizing service deployments. While existing multi-region load balancers save prefill computation by prioritizing Key--Value (KV) Cache hit rate, they ignore cluster networking latency, a critical factor in routing decisions. We introduce GORGO, a method for minimizing TTFT by optimizing a total serving cost as a function of available compute, network latency, and prefix caching. Using extensive profiling on custom infrastructure, we analyze component-level latency bottlenecks and benchmark GORGO against three baselines: (1) naive least-load routing, which ignores prefix-cache overlap; (2) prefix-similarity routing, which selectively pushes requests to the replica with the highest cached-prefix overlap; and (3) a centralized HTTP proxy that runs the GORGO policy while tracking requests across all nodes. We demonstrate that GORGO reduces P99 TTFT through network-aware routing and improves average TTFT by preventing pathological cross-region forwarding. Additionally, we find that GORGO-proxy overcomes synchronization overhead in previous methods and is 2.5x faster on median TTFT, demonstrating the success of a centralized router.</description>

      <title>Real-World Asset Integration in Next-Generation Communication Networks: Fundamental, Framework, and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation communication networks are characterized by integrated ultra-high reliability, ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, and ubiquitous coverage. However, this paradigm faces significant structural challenges of liquidity and security. Liquidity issues arise from prohibitive upfront costs of network resources, which strain the limited capital and financial flexibility. This also limits the deployment of the resource- and investment-intensive security solutions, bringing security issues. Security vulnerabilities arise from the decentralized architecture as well, particularly threats posed by Byzantine nodes. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel framework utilizing Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization for tokenizing network resources. RWA tokenization uses blockchain to convert ownership rights of real-world assets into digital tokens that can be programmed, divided, and traded. We then analyze the criteria for identifying suitable assets. Through a case study on dynamic spectrum allocation, we demonstrate the superior performance of this RWA approach. Particularly under conditions of resource scarcity, it can exhibit strong resilience against collusion and default attacks. Finally, we delineate fruitful avenues for future research in this nascent field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of robotics and next-generation communication is a critical driver of technological advancement. As the world transitions from 5G to 6G, the foundational capabilities of wireless networks are evolving to support increasingly complex and autonomous robotic systems. This paper examines the transformative impact of 6G on enhancing key robotics functionalities. It provides a systematic mapping of IMT-2030 key performance indicators to robotic functional blocks including sensing, perception, cognition, actuation and self-learning. Building upon this mapping, we propose a high-level architectural framework integrating robotic, intelligent, and network service planes, underscoring the need for a holistic approach. As an example use case, we present a real-time, dynamic safety framework enabled by IMT-2030 capabilities for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared spaces.</description>

      <title>Multi Layer Protection Against Low Rate DDoS Attacks in Containerized Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low rate Distributed Denial of Service DDoS attacks have emerged as a major threat to containerized cloud infrastructures. Due to their low traffic volumes, these attacks can be difficult to detect and mitigate, potentially causing serious harm to internet applications. This work proposes a DDoS mitigation system that effectively defends against low rate DDoS attacks in containerized environments using a multi layered defense strategy. The solution integrates a Web Application Firewall WAF, rate limiting, dynamic blacklisting, TCP and UDP header analysis, and zero trust principles to detect and block malicious traffic at different stages of the attack life cycle. By applying zero trust principles, the system ensures that each data packet is carefully inspected before granting access, improving overall security and resilience. Additionally, the systems integration with Docker orchestration facilitates deployment and management in containerized settings.</description>

      <title>C-POD: An AWS Cloud Framework for Edge Pod Automation and Remote Wireless Testbed Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents C-POD, a cloud-native framework that automates the deployment and management of edge pods for seamless remote access and sharing of wireless testbeds. C-POD leverages public cloud resources and edge pods to lower the barrier to over-the-air (OTA) experimentation, enabling researchers to share and access distributed testbeds without extensive local infrastructure. A supporting toolkit has been developed for C-POD to enable flexible and scalable experimental workflows, including containerized edge environments, persistent Secure Shell (SSH) tunnels, and stable graphical interfaces. We prototype and deploy C-POD on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud to demonstrate its key features, including cloud-assisted edge pod deployment automation, elastic computing resource management, and experiment observability, by integrating two wireless testbeds that focus on RF signal generation and 5G(B) communications, respectively.</description>

      <title>Reliable and Private Anonymous Routing for Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shared, dynamic network infrastructures, such as dual-use LEO satellite constellations, pose critical threats to metadata privacy, particularly for state actors operating in mixed-trust environments. This work proposes an enhanced anonymity architecture, evolving the Loopix mix-network, to provide robust security and reliability in these volatile topologies. We introduce three primary contributions: (1) A multi-path transport protocol utilizing $(n, k)$ erasure codes, which is demonstrated to counteract the high link volatility and intermittent connectivity that renders standard mix-networks unreliable. (2) The integration of a computationally efficient Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol during route discovery. (3) The introduction of adaptive, centrality-based delay strategies that efficiently mitigate the inherent topological bias of LEO networks, providing a superior anonymity-to-latency trade-off. This mechanism provably prevents metadata leakage at the user-provider directory, mitigating profiling and correlation attacks. We validate this architecture via high-fidelity, packet-level simulations of a LEO constellation. Empirical results show our multi-path transport achieves near-zero message loss, establishing a quantifiable trade-off between reliability and bandwidth overhead. Furthermore, microbenchmarks of the PIR protocol quantify its computational and latency overheads, confirming its feasibility for practical deployment. This work provides a validated blueprint for deployable high-anonymity communication systems, demonstrating the viability of securely multiplexing sensitive operations within large-scale commercial network infrastructures.</description>

      <title>An Auction-Based Mechanism for Optimal Task Allocation and Resource Aware Containerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed computing has enabled cooperation between multiple computing devices for the simultaneous execution of resource-hungry tasks. Such execution also plays a pivotal role in the parallel execution of numerous tasks in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Leveraging the computing resources of multiple devices, the offloading and processing of computationintensive tasks can be carried out more efficiently. However, managing resources and optimizing costs remain challenging for successfully executing tasks in cloud-based containerization for IoT. This paper proposes AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism for efficient offloading of computation tasks among multiple local servers in the context of IoT devices. The approach leverages the concept of Docker swarm, which connects multiple local servers in the form of Manager Node (MN) and Worker Nodes (WNs). It uses Docker containerization to execute tasks simultaneously. In this system, IoT devices send tasks to the MN, which then sends the task details to all its WNs to participate in the auction-based bidding process. The auctionbased bidding process optimizes the allocation of computation tasks among multiple systems, considering their resource sufficiency. The experimental analysis establishes that the approach offers improved offloading and computation-intensive services for IoT devices by enabling cooperation between local servers.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Security-Induced Latency on 5G RAN Interfaces and User Plane Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G promises enhanced performance-not only in bandwidth and capacity, but also latency and security. Its ultra-reliable low-latency configuration targets round-trip times below 1 ms, while optional security controls extend protection across all interfaces, making 5G attractive for mission-critical applications. A key enabler of low latency is the disaggregation of network components, including the RAN, allowing user-plane functions to be deployed nearer to end users. However, this split introduces additional interfaces, whose protection increases latency overhead. In this paper, guided by discussions with a network operator and a 5G manufacturer, we evaluate the latency overhead of enabling optional 5G security controls across internal RAN interfaces and the 5G user plane. To this end, we deploy the first testbed implementing a disaggregated RAN with standardized optional security mechanisms. Our results show that disaggregated RAN deployments retain a latency advantage over monolithic designs, even with security enabled. However, achieving sub-1 ms round-trip times remains challenging, as cryptographic overhead alone can already exceed this target.</description>

      <title>Transmit or Idle: Efficient AoI Optimal Transmission Policy for Gossiping Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal transmission and scheduling policy for a transmitter (source) communicating with two gossiping receivers aiming at tracking the source's status over time using the age of information (AoI) metric. Gossiping enables local information exchange in a decentralized manner without relying solely on the transmitter's direct communication, which we assume incurs a transmission cost. On the other hand, gossiping may be communicating stale information, necessitating the transmitter's intervention. With communication links having specific success probabilities, we formulate an average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) to jointly minimize the sum AoI and transmission cost for such a system in a time-slotted setting. We employ the Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm to evaluate the optimal policy for the transmitter and then prove several structural properties showing that it has an age-difference threshold structure with minimum age activation in the case where gossiping is relatively more reliable. Specifically, direct transmission is optimal only if the minimum AoI of the receivers is large enough and their age difference is below a certain threshold. Otherwise, the transmitter idles to effectively take advantage of gossiping and reduce direct transmission costs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the significance of our optimal policy compared to multiple baselines. Our result is a first step towards characterizing optimal freshness and transmission cost trade-offs in gossiping networks.</description>

      <title>QoE-Driven Multi-Task Offloading for Semantic-Aware Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides low-latency offloading solutions for computationally intensive tasks, effectively improving the computing efficiency and battery life of mobile devices. However, for data-intensive tasks or scenarios with limited uplink bandwidth, network congestion might occur due to massive simultaneous offloading nodes, increasing transmission latency and affecting task performance. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware multi-modal task offloading framework to address the challenges posed by limited uplink bandwidth. By introducing a semantic extraction factor, we balance the relationship among transmission latency, computation energy consumption, and task performance. To measure the offloading performance of multi-modal tasks, we design a unified and fair quality of experience (QoE) metric that includes execution latency, energy consumption, and task performance. Lastly, we formulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and exploit the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) reinforcement learning algorithm to jointly optimize the semantic extraction factor, communication resources, and computing resources to maximize overall QoE. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a reduction in execution latency and energy consumption of 18.1% and 12.9%, respectively compared with the semantic-unaware approach. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to models with different user preferences.</description>

      <title>A Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) Source Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) offers broadband, per channel heralded EPR pairs, with a rich parameter space that allows its performance to be tailored for specific applications. We present a modular ZALM simulator that demonstrates how design choices affect output rate and fidelity. Built in NetSquid with QSI controllers, it exposes 20+ tunable parameters, supports IDEAL and REALISTIC modes, and provides reusable components for Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) sources, interference, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) filtering, fiber delay, active polarization gates, detectors, and lossy fiber. Physics based models capture Hong Ou Mandel (HOM) visibility, insertion loss, detector efficiency, gate errors, and attenuation. Using this tool, we map trade offs among fidelity, link distance, and entangled pairs per use, and show how SPDC bandwidth and DWDM grid spacing steer performance. Using the default configuration settings, average fidelity remains constant at 0.83 but the ebit rate decreases from 0.0175 at the source to 0.0 at 50 km; narrowing the SPDC degeneracy bandwidth increases the ebit rate significantly without affecting fidelity. The simulator enables codesign of source, filtering, and feedforward settings for specific quantum memories and integrates as a building block for end to end quantum network studies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Takes Flight: Two-Stage Resilient Topology Optimization for UAV Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communication networks must maintain reliable connectivity under rapid topology changes, fluctuating link quality, and time-critical data exchange. Existing topology control methods rely on global optimization to produce a single optimal topology or involve high computational complexity, which limits adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper presents a two-stage quantum-assisted framework for efficient and resilient topology control in dynamic UAV networks by exploiting quantum parallelism to generate a set of high-quality and structurally diverse candidate topologies. In the offline stage, we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and leverage quantum annealing (QA) to parallelly sample multiple high-quality and structurally distinct topologies, providing a rich solution space for adaptive decision-making. In the online stage, a lightweight classical selection mechanism rapidly identifies the most suitable topology based on real-time link stability and channel conditions, substantially reducing the computation delay. The simulation results show that, compared to a single static optimal topology, the proposed framework improves performance retention by 6.6% in a 30-second dynamic window. Moreover, relative to the classic method, QA achieves an additional 5.15% reduction in objective value and a 28.3% increase in solution diversity. These findings demonstrate the potential of QA to enable fast and robust topology control for next-generation UAV communication networks.</description>

      <title>SplitCom: Communication-efficient Split Federated Fine-tuning of LLMs via Temporal Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of on-device large language models (LLMs) mitigates privacy concerns by preventing raw data sharing. However, the intensive computational and memory demands pose significant challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, split federated learning (SFL) emerges as a promising solution that partitions the model into lightweight client-side and compute-intensive server-side sub-models, thus offloading the primary training workload to a powerful server. Nevertheless, high-dimensional activation exchanges in SFL lead to excessive communication overhead. To overcome this, we propose SplitCom, a communication-efficient SFL framework for LLMs that exploits temporal redundancy in activations across consecutive training epochs. Inspired by video compression, the core innovation of our framework lies in selective activation uploading only when a noticeable deviation from previous epochs occurs. To balance communication efficiency and learning performance, we introduce two adaptive threshold control schemes based on 1) bang-bang control or 2) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we implement dimensionality reduction techniques to alleviate client-side memory requirements. Furthermore, we extend SplitCom to the U-shape architecture, ensuring the server never accesses clients' labels. Extensive simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate that SplitCom reduces uplink communication costs by up to 98.6\,\% in its standard configuration and total communication costs by up to 95.8\,\% in its U-shape variant without noticeably compromising model performance.</description>

      <title>KeySpace: Enhancing Public Key Infrastructure for Interplanetary Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10963v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the use of satellites continues to grow, new networking paradigms are emerging to support the scale and long distance communication inherent to these networks. In particular, interplanetary communication relays connect distant network segments together, but result in a sparsely connected network with long-distance links that are frequently interrupted. In this new context, traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) becomes difficult to implement, due to the impossibility of low-latency queries to a central authority. This paper addresses the challenge of implementing PKI in these complex networks, identifying the essential goals and requirements.
  Using these requirements, we develop the KeySpace framework, comprising a set of standardized experiments and metrics for comparing PKI systems across various network topologies, evaluating their performance and security. This enables the testing of different protocols and configurations in a standard, repeatable manner, so that improvements can be more fairly tested and clearly demonstrated. We use KeySpace to test two standard PKI protocols in use in terrestrial networks (OCSP and CRLs), demonstrating for the first time that both can be effectively utilized even in interplanetary networks with high latency and frequent interruptions, provided authority is properly distributed throughout the network. Finally, we propose and evaluate a number of novel techniques extending standard OCSP to improve the overhead of connection establishment, reduce link congestion, and limit the reach of an attacker with a compromised key. Using KeySpace we validate these claims, demonstrating their improved performance over the state of the art.</description>

Abstract: Network segmentation is a popular security practice for limiting lateral movement, yet practitioners lack a metric to measure how segmented a network actually is. We introduce the first statistically principled metric for network segmentedness based on global edge density, enabling practitioners to quantify what has previously been assessed only qualitatively. Then, we derive a normalized estimator for segmentedness and evaluate its uncertainty using confidence intervals. For a 95\% confidence interval with a margin-of-error of $\pm 0.1$, we show that a minimum of $M=97$ sampled node pairs is sufficient. This result is independent of the total number of nodes in the network, provided that node pairs are sampled uniformly at random. We evaluate the estimator through Monte Carlo simulations on Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi, stochastic block models, and real-world enterprise network datasets, demonstrating accurate estimation and well-behaved coverage. Finally, we discuss applications of the estimator, such as baseline tracking, zero trust assessment, and merger integration.</description>
