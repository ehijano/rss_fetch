      <title>Accelerating Scientific Research Through a Multi-LLM Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of academic publications poses challenges for the research process, such as literature review and procedural planning. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful AI tools, especially when combined with additional tools and resources. Recent LLM-powered frameworks offer promising solutions for handling complex domain-specific tasks, yet their domain-specific implementation limits broader applicability. This highlights the need for LLM-integrated systems that can assist in cross-disciplinary tasks, such as streamlining the research process across science and engineering disciplines. To address this need, we introduce Artificial Research Innovator Assistant (ARIA), a four-agent, multi-LLM framework. By emulating a team of expert assistants, ARIA systematically replicates the human research workflow to autonomously search, retrieve, and filter hundreds of papers, subsequently synthesizing relevant literature into actionable research procedures. In a case study on dropwise condensation enhancement, ARIA demonstrates its capability to streamline research tasks within an hour, maintaining user oversight during execution and ultimately liberating researchers from time-intensive tasks.</description>

      <title>Electron Fourier ptychography for phase reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase reconstruction is important in transmission electron microscopy for structural studies. We describe electron Fourier ptychography and its application to phase reconstruction of both radiation-resistant and beam-sensitive materials. We demonstrate that the phase of the exit wave can be reconstructed at high resolution using a modified iterative phase retrieval algorithm with data collected using an alternative optical geometry. This method achieves a spatial resolution of 0.63 nm at a fluence of $4.5 \times 10^2 \, e^-/\text{nm}^2$, as validated on Cry11Aa protein crystals under cryogenic conditions. Notably, this method requires no additional hardware modifications, is straightforward to implement, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing data collection software, providing a broadly accessible approach for structural studies.</description>

      <title>Identification of orbital pumping from spin pumping and rectification effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently predicted mechanism of orbital pumping enables the generation of pure orbital current from a precessing ferromagnet (FM) without the need for electrical current injection. This orbital current can be efficiently injected into an adjacent nonmagnetic material (NM) without being hampered by electrical conductivity mismatch. However, experimentally identifying this novel effect presents significant challenges due to the substantial background contributions from spin pumping and spin rectification effects (SREs). In this work, we disentangle the effects of orbital pumping from spin pumping in bilayer structures composed of Nb/Ni and Nb/$\mathrm{Fe_{60}Co_{20}B_{20}}$ by observing a sign reversal of the measured voltage. This reversal arises from the competing signs of the spin and orbital Hall effects in the Nb. We establish methods to differentiate the pumping signal from SREs by analyzing the distinct angular dependence of the measured voltage and its spatial dependence relative to the radio frequency excitation source.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>On the crystalline environment of luminescent Tb$^{3+}$ ions embedded in indium tin oxide thin films: a DFT and Crystal field analysis assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the local symmetry and crystal environment of trivalent terbium ions embedded in an indium tin oxide (ITO) matrix with bixbyite structure. The \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} ions tend to substitute \mbox{In$^{3+}$} ions in two different cationic sites ($b$ and $d$). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} ions are mainly located at $C_2$ symmetry sites relaxing selection rules and enabling electric dipole transitions, with the $^5\text{D}_4\rightarrow\leftindex^7{\text{F}}_2$ transition being the most intense, providing a red color to the light emission. Photoluminescence emission spectra under UV excitation at \qty{83}{\kelvin} revealed 30 intra-4$f$ transitions, which were assigned to the $\leftindex^7{\text{F}}_J$ ground multiplet of the \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} ion. Crystal-field analysis shows a strong alignment between calculated and observed energy levels, yielding a standard deviation of $\sigma=\qty{15.1}{\centi\per\metre}$. We believe these results can help to understand the activation mechanisms of \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} luminescent centers in transparent conductive oxides, as well as the potential to modulate \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} emission color through its crystalline environment.</description>

      <title>Statistically validated projection of bipartite signed networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite networks provide a major insight into the organisation of many real-world systems, describing the mechanisms that drive interactions between distinct groups of nodes. Of particular interest are two-mode networks whose edges admit a sign: examples are provided by human interactions with entities such as products, where agents either cast either a positive or negative vote or abstain from voting at all. One of the most relevant issues encountered when modelling a bipartite network is devising a way to obtain a monopartite projection onto the layer of interest that preserves the information encoded into the original structure as much as possible. In the present contribution, we propose an unsupervised algorithm to obtain statistically validated projections of bipartite signed networks, according to which any two nodes sharing a statistically significant number of concordant (discordant) relationships are connected by a positive (negative) edge. More precisely, we propose two variants of it, according to the way ambivalent patterns and missing ties are treated. Since assessing the statistical significance of any two nodes similarity requires a proper benchmark, here we consider four different Exponential Random Graphs, defined by global as well as local constraints, either leaving the topology free or keeping the topology fixed. Our algorithm outputs a matrix of link-specific $p-$values, from which a validated projection can be obtained upon running a multiple-hypothesis testing procedure. After testing our method on synthetic configurations output by a fully controllable generative model, we apply it to several real-world configurations: in all cases, non-trivial mesoscopic structures, induced by relationships that cannot be traced back to the constraints defining the employed benchmarks, are detected.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared group-IV nanowire laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires have shown great potential for enabling ultra-compact lasers for integrated photonics platforms. Despite the impressive progress in developing nanowire lasers, their integration into Si photonics platforms remains challenging largely due to the use of III-V and II-VI semiconductors as gain media. These materials not only have high material costs, but also require inherently complex integration with Si-based fabrication processing, increasing overall costs and thereby limiting their large-scale adoption. Furthermore, these material-based nanowire lasers rarely emit above 2 um, which is a technologically important wavelength regime for various applications in imaging and quantum sensing. Recently, group-IV nanowires, particularly direct bandgap GeSn nanowires capable of emitting above 2 um, have emerged as promising cost-effective gain media for Si-compatible nanowire lasers, but there has been no successful demonstration of lasing from this seemingly promising nanowire platform. Herein, we report the experimental observation of lasing above 2 um from a single bottom-up grown GeSn nanowire. By harnessing strain engineering and optimized cavity designs simultaneously, the single GeSn nanowire achieves an amplified material gain that can sufficiently overcome minimized optical losses, resulting in a single-mode lasing with an ultra-low threshold of ~5.3 kW cm-2. Our finding paves the way for all-group IV mid-infrared photonic-integrated circuits with compact Si-compatible lasers for on-chip classical and quantum sensing and free-space communication.</description>

      <title>Optimizing electro-optic modulators for interfacing color centers in an integrated silicon carbide platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon carbide is a promising material platform for hosting various color centers suitable for quantum information processing. Here, we report the design and demonstration of an integrated electro-optic modulator that can directly interface the silicon vacancy centers in the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator platform. Despite a relatively low electro-optic coefficient ($0.22$ pm/V), the optimized silicon carbide modulator is able to work in the 920 nm range with a propagation loss of less than $0.5$ dB/cm, featuring a 3-dB bandwidth around 500 MHz, an extinction ratio of 8-12 dB for an operating peak-to-peak voltage of 10 V, and a footprint of less than $0.1\ \text{mm}^2$. With such modulation performance, our work provides a cost-effective solution for the chip-scale implementation of the electro-optic modulation technology for interfacing color centers in the silicon carbide platform.</description>
