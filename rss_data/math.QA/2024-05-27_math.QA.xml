      <title>On a family of simple skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several constructions have been given for families of simple braces, but few examples are known of simple skew braces which are not braces. In this paper, we exhibit the first example of an infinite family of simple skew braces which are not braces and which do not arise from nonabelian simple groups. More precisely, we show that, for any primes $p$, $q$ such that $q$ divides ${(p^p-1)}/{(p-1)}$, there are exactly two simple skew braces (up to isomorphism) of order $p^p q$.</description>

      <title>On deformation quantization of the space of connections on a two manifold and Chern Simons Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use recent progress on Chern-Simons gauge theory in three dimensions [18] to give explicit, closed form formulas for the star product on some functions on the affine space ${\mathcal A}(\Sigma)$ of (smooth) connections on the trivialized principal $G$-bundle on a compact, oriented two manifold $\Sigma.$ These formulas give a close relation between knot invariants, such as the Kauffman bracket polynomial, and the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials, arising in Chern Simons gauge theory, and deformation quantization of ${\mathcal A}(\Sigma).$ This relation echoes the relation between the manifold invariants of Witten [20] and Reshetikhin-Turaev [16] and {\em geometric} quantization of this space (or its symplectic quotient by the action of the gauge group). In our case this relation arises from explicit algebraic formulas arising from the (mathematically well-defined) functional integrals of [18].</description>

      <title>A Derivation of Geometric Quantization via Feynman's Path Integral on Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the geometric quantization program of symplectic manifolds, in the sense of both Kostant-Souriau and Weinstein, from Feynman's path integral formulation on phase space. The state space we use contains states with negative norm and polarized sections determine a Hilbert space. We discuss ambiguities in the definition of path integrals arising from the distinct Riemann sum prescriptions and its consequence on the quantization of symplectomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Strong duality Data of type $A$ and extended $T$-systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended $T$-systems are a number of short exact sequences in the category of finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras of types $A_n^{(1)}$ and $B_n^{(1)}$, introduced by Mukhin and Young as a generalization of the $T$-systems. In this paper we establish the extended $T$-systems for more general modules, which are constructed from an arbitrary strong duality datum of type $A$. Our approach does not use the theory of $q$-characters, and so also provides a new proof to the original Mukhin-Young's extended $T$-systems.</description>

      <title>RLL-realization of two-parameter quantum affine algebra of type $B_n^{(1)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we firstly provide the correspondence between the FRT formalism and the Drindeld-Jimbo presentation for $U_{r, s}(\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1})$, using the theory of finite dimensional weight modules. In the affine case $U_{r, s}(\widehat{\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}}),$ we give its RLL realization via the Gauss decomposition. Thus we establish the correspondence between this realization and the Drinfeld realization.</description>

      <title>Derived deformation theory of algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.07255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to develop an explicit derived deformation theory of algebraic structures at a high level of generality, encompassing in a common framework various kinds of algebras (associative, commutative, Poisson...) or bialgebras (associative and coassociative, Lie, Frobenius...), that is algebraic structures parametrized by props. A central aspect is that we define and study moduli spaces of deformations of algebraic structures up to quasi-isomorphisms (and not just isotopies or isomorphisms). To do so, we implement methods coming from derived algebraic geometry, by encapsulating these deformation theories as classifying (pre)stacks with good infinitesimal properties and derived formal geometry, by means of derived formal moduli problems and derived formal groups. In particular, we prove that the Lie algebra describing the deformation theory of an object in a given $\infty$-category of dg algebras can be obtained equivalently as the tangent complex of loops on a derived quotient of this moduli space by the homotopy automorphims of this object. Moreover, we provide explicit formulae for such derived deformation problems of algebraic structures up to quasi-isomorphisms and relate them in a precise way to other standard deformation problems of algebraic structures. This relation is given by a fiber sequence of the associated dg-Lie algebras of their deformation complexes. Our results provide simultaneously a vast generalization of standard deformation theory of algebraic structures which is suitable (and needed) to set up algebraic deformation theory both at the $\infty$-categorical level and at a higher level of generality than algebras over operads. In addition, we study a general criterion to compare formal moduli problems of different algebraic structures and apply our formalism to $E_n$-algebras and bialgebras.</description>
