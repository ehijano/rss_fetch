      <title>A Novel Summation Formula for the Hurwitz-Kronecker Class Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present a novel and elegant summation formula for $H_w$, the Kronecker-Hurwitz class number. Specifically, for any prime $p$, we have the formula: $$ \sum_{t^2&lt;p} H_w(t^2-p) = \frac{p-2}{3}. $$</description>

      <title>Number of integers represented by families of binary forms III: fewnomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of papers we investigated the following question: given a family $\calF$ of binary forms having nonzero discriminant and integer coefficients, for each $d\geqslant 3$, we estimate the number of integers $m$ with $|m|\leqslant N$ which are represented by an element in $\calF$ of degree $\geqslant d$. Under suitable assumptions, asymptotically as $N\to\infty$, the main term in the estimate is given by the forms in $\calF$ having degree $d$ (if any), while the forms of degree $&gt;d$ contribute only to the error term. The present text is devoted to fewnomials \[ a_0X^{kr}+a_1X^{k(r-1)}Y^k+\cdots +a_{r-1}X^kY^{k(r-1)}+a_rY^{kr} \] with fixed $r\geqslant 1$ and varying $k,a_0,a_1,\dots,a_r$.</description>

      <title>On the unit group scheme of the group algebra of a certain non-commutative finite flat group scheme over an $\Bbb{F}_{p}$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suwa investigated the unit group scheme of the group ring associated with a finite flat group scheme and provided a characterization of torsors possessing the normal base property for such schemes. In this paper, we examine the unit group scheme of the group ring for a specific non-commutative finite flat group scheme and characterize torsors with the normal base property in this context. Moreover, in connection with the Noether problem for Hopf algebras proposed by Kassel and Masuoka, we compute the quotient of the unit group scheme under the action of this non-commutative finite flat group scheme.</description>

      <title>The Diophantine Frobenius Problem revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\ge 2$ and $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_k$ be positive integers with \[ \gcd(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_k)=1. \] It is proved that there exists a positive integer $G_{a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_k}$ such that every integer $n$ strictly greater than it can be represented as the form \[ n=a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_kx_k, \quad (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0},~\gcd(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k)=1). \] We then investigate the size of $G_{a_1, a_2}$ explicitly. Our result strengthens the primality requirement of $x$'s in the classical Diophantine Frobenius Problem.</description>

      <title>Schanuel conjecture for 1-motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schanuel Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function. In particular it implies the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem. In my Ph.D. I showed that Schanuel Conjecture has a geometrical origin: it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive without abelian part.
  In this paper, we state a conjecture in Schanuel style, which will imply conjectures in Lindemann-Weierstrass style, for the semi-elliptic exponential function, that is for the exponential map of an extension G of an elliptic curve E by a multiplicative group. We propose the semi-elliptic Conjecture, which concerns the exponential function, the Weierstrass $\wp,$ $\zeta$ functions and Serre functions. The case of a trivial extension has been treated in \cite{BW}, where we introduced the split semi-elliptic Conjecture.
  As in Schanuel's case, we expect that the semi-elliptic Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function, of the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ functions and of Serre functions.
  We show that the semi-elliptic Conjecture has a geometrical origin (as Schanuel Conjecture): it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive whose underlying abelian part is an elliptic curve.
  We prove the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture for 1-motives defined by an elliptic curve with algebraic invariants and complex multiplication and by torsion points.
  We introduce the $\sigma$-Conjecture which involves the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ and $\sigma$ functions and we show that this conjecture is a consequence of the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to an adequate 1-motive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove several infinite family of congruences for some restricted partitions introduced by Pushpa and Vasuki (2022) (thereby, also proving a conjecture of Dasappa et. al. (2023)). We also prove some isolated congruences which seem to have been missed by earlier authors. Our proof techniques uses both elementary means as well as the theory of modular forms.</description>

      <title>Percolative properties of the random coprime colouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $u$ and $v$ in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, say that $u$ is visible from $v$ if the segment from $u$ to $v$ contains exactly two elements, which are $u$ and $v$. Take $X$ "uniformly at random in $\mathbb{Z}^d$" and colour each vertex $u$ of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in white if $u$ is visible from $X$ and in black otherwise. Previous independent works of Pleasants-Huck and of the third author give a precise meaning to this definition. This paper is dedicated to the study of this random colouring from the point of view of percolation theory: given a reasonable graph structure on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, how many infinite black (resp. white) connected components are there?</description>

      <title>Iwasawa theory of fine Selmer groups over global fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.01751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $F$ is a subgroup of the classical $p^\infty$-Selmer group of $E$ over $F$. Fine Selmer group is closely related to the 1st and 2nd Iwasawa cohomology groups. Coates-Sujatha observed that the structure of the fine Selmer group of $E$ over a $p$-adic Lie extension of a number field is intricately related to some deep questions in classical Iwasawa theory; for example, Iwasawa's classical $\mu$-invariant vanishing conjecture. In this article, we study the properties of the $p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve over certain $p$-adic Lie extensions of a number field. We also define and discuss $p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve over function fields of characteristic $p$ and also of characteristic $\ell \neq p.$ We relate our study with a conjecture of Jannsen.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of solutions to linear Diophantine equations on Piatetski-Shapiro sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sequence of integers of the form $\lfloor n^{\alpha}\rfloor$ $(n=1,2,\ldots)$ for some fixed non-integral $\alpha&gt;1$ is called a Piatetski-Shapiro sequence, where $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the integer part of $x$. Let $\mathrm{PS}(\alpha)$ denote the set of all those terms. In this article, we show that $x+y=z$ has only finitely many solutions $(x,y,z)\in \mathrm{PS}(\alpha)^3$ for almost every $\alpha&gt;3$. Furthermore, we show that $\mathrm{PS}(\alpha)$ has only finitely many arithmetic progressions of length $3$ for almost every $\alpha&gt;10$. In addition, we estimate upper bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of $\alpha\in [s,t]$ such that $y=a_1x_1+\cdots +a_nx_n$ has infinitely many solutions on $\mathrm{PS}(\alpha)$.</description>

      <title>Norm Orthogonal Bases and Invariants of $p$-adic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2018, the longest vector problem (LVP) and the closest vector problem (CVP) in $p$-adic lattices were introduced. These problems are closely linked to the orthogonalization process. In this paper, we first prove that every $p$-adic lattice has an orthogonal basis and give definition to the successive maxima and the escape distance, as the $p$-adic analogues of the successive minima and the covering radius in Euclidean lattices. Then, we present deterministic polynomial time algorithms to perform the orthogonalization process, solve the LVP and solve the CVP with an orthogonal basis of the whole vector space. Finally, we conclude that orthogonalization and the CVP are polynomially equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture results about the moments of mixed derivatives of the Riemann zeta function, evaluated at the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. We do this in two different ways, both giving us the same conjecture. In the first, we find asymptotics for the moments of derivatives of the characteristic polynomials of matrices in the Circular Unitary Ensemble. In the second, we consider the hybrid model approach first proposed by Gonek, Hughes and Keating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a list of $113$ holomorphic eta-quotients of integral weight ($66$ of which are primitive) and provide a uniform closed formula for their Fourier coefficients $c(l)$ where $l\equiv1\bmod{m}$ with some fixed $m\mid24$. The proof involves Wohlfahrt's extension of Hecke operators and a dimension formula for spaces of modular forms of general multiplier system. We further provide the expansions of these eta-quotients as linear combinations of standard Eisenstein series.</description>

Abstract: For any commutative finite flat group scheme, Grothendieck constructed an embedding into some smooth group scheme. This embedding is called the Grothendieck resolution. Let $p$ be a prime number and $n$ a positive integer. In connection with the normal basis problems in the framework of group schemes proposed by Suwa and the author, we consider the Grothendieck resolution for a certain finite flat commutative group scheme of order $p^{n}$ over an $\Bbb{F}_{p}$-algebra.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two abelian varieties $A$ and $B$ over a number field $K$ are said to be strongly locally quadratic twists if they are quadratic twists at every completion of $K$. While it was known that this does not imply that $A$ and $B$ are quadratic twists over $K$, the only known counterexamples (necessarily of dimension $\geq 4$) are not geometrically simple. We show that, for every prime $p\equiv 13 \pmod{24}$, there exists a pair of geometrically simple abelian varieties of dimension $p-1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that are strongly locally quadratic twists but not quadratic twists. The proof is based on Galois cohomology computations and class field theory.</description>

      <title>Singular intersections in families of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a smooth irreducible curve defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian scheme over $S$ and $\mathcal{C}$ a curve inside $\mathcal{A}$, both defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. In this paper we prove that the set of points in which $\mathcal{C}$ intersects proper flat subgroup schemes of $\mathcal{A}$ tangentially is finite. The crucial case of elliptic curves already follows from a result by Corvaja, Demeio, Masser and Zannier: in this case we provide an alternative proof using the Pila-Zannier method. Such a proof may lead to an effective result using an effective point-counting theorem. This fits in the framework of the so-called problems of unlikely intersections, and can be seen as a variation of the relative Pink conjecture for abelian varieties.</description>

We show that under the assumption of an exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for any $q&lt;x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic $$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$ holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$. We also find that for any fixed $a$, the above holds for almost all $q&lt;x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$ with $(a,q)=1$. Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes (by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$ (i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption that $q&lt;x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In previous work we computed the number $C_n(q)$ of ideals of codimension $n$ of the algebra ${\mathbb{F}}_q[x,y,x^{-1}, y^{-1}]$ of two-variable Laurent polynomials over a finite field: it turned out that $C_n(q)$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n$ in $q$, divisible by $(q-1)^2$. The quotient $P_n(q) = C_n(q)/(q-1)^2$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n-2$. For each $n\geq 1$ let ${\overline{P}}_n(X) \in {\mathbb{Z}}[X]$ be the degree $n-1$ polynomial such that ${\overline{P}}_n(q+q^{-1}) = P_n(q)/q^{n-1}$. In this note we show that for any integer $N$ the integer value ${\overline{P}}_n(N)$ is close to the value at $N$ of the degree $n-1$ polynomial $F_{n-1}(X) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \, {\overline{T}}_k(X)$, which is a sum of monic versions ${\overline{T}}_k(X)$ of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We give a precise formula for ${\overline{P}}_n(X)$ as a linear combination of $F_k(X)$'s, each appearance of the latter being parametrized by an odd divisor of $n$. As a consequence, ${\overline{P}}_n(X) = F_{n-1}(X)$ if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$. We exhibit similar formulas for $C_n(q)$.</description>

      <title>The SOS Rank of Biquadratic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1973, Calder\'{o}n proved that an $m \times 2$ positive semidefinite (psd) biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of ${3m(m+1) \over 2}$ squares of quadratic forms. Very recently, by applying Hilbert's theorem, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of three squares of bilinear forms. This improved Calder\'{o}n's result for $m=2$, and left the sos (sum-of-squares) rank problem of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show that a $3 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as four squares of bilinear forms. For $m \ge 4$, we make a conjecture that an $m \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as $m+1$ squares of bilinear forms.</description>

      <title>A Pair of Diophantine Equations and Fibonacci-Like Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two relatively prime numbers $a$ and $b$, it is known that exactly one of the two Diophantine equations has a nonnegative integral solution $(x,y)$: $$
  ax + by \ =\ \frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}\quad \mbox{ and }\quad 1 + ax + by \ =\ \frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}. $$ Furthermore, the solution is unique. This paper surveys recent results on finding the solution and determining which equation is used when $a$ and $b$ are taken from certain sequences. We contribute to the literature by finding $(x,y)$ when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive terms of sequences having the Fibonacci recurrence and arbitrary initial terms.</description>

      <title>On the rationalization of the $K(n)$-local sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the rational homotopy groups of the $K(n)$-local sphere for all heights $n$ and all primes $p$, verifying a prediction that goes back to the pioneering work of Morava in the early 1970s. More precisely, we show that the inclusion of the Witt vectors into the Lubin-Tate ring induces a split injection on continuous stabilizer cohomology with torsion cokernel of bounded exponent, thereby proving Hopkins' chromatic splitting conjecture and the vanishing conjecture of Beaudry-Goerss-Henn rationally. The key ingredients are the equivalence between the Lubin-Tate tower and the Drinfeld tower due to Faltings and Scholze-Weinstein, integral $p$-adic Hodge theory, and an integral refinement of a theorem of Tate on the Galois cohomology of non-archimedean fields.</description>

      <title>Sharp bound for the Erd\H{o}s-Straus non-averaging set problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of integers $A$ is non-averaging if there is no element $a$ in $A$ which can be written as an average of a subset of $A$ not containing $a$. We show that the largest non-averaging subset of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ has size $n^{1/4+o(1)}$, thus solving the Erd\H{o}s-Straus problem. We also determine the largest size of a non-averaging set in a $d$-dimensional box for any fixed $d$. Our main tool includes the structure theorem for the set of subset sums due to Conlon, Fox and the first author, together with a result about the structure of a point set in nearly convex position.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2003, Benoit Cloitre entered a family of sequences in the OEIS that we call hiccup sequences. We collect the various claims, observations, and proofs of properties of these sequences that have been entered in the OEIS over the years, and present a unified approach, inspired by a remarkable theorem of Bosma, Dekking, and Steiner.</description>
