      <title>The Relation Between Variances of a 3D Density and Its 2D Column Density Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the relation between the variance of three-dimensional (3D) density ($\sigma^{2}_{\rho}$) and that of the projected two-dimensional (2D) column density ($\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma}$) in turbulent media, which is of great importance in obtaining turbulence properties from observations. Earlier studies showed that $\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}/\sigma^{2}_{\rho / \rho_{0}} = \mathcal{R}$, where $\Sigma/\Sigma_0$ and $\rho/\rho_0$ are 2D column and 3D volume densities normalized by their mean values, respectively. The factor $\mathcal{R}$ depends only on the density spectrum for isotropic turbulence in a cloud that has similar dimensions along and perpendicular to the line of sight. Our major findings in this paper are as follows. First, we show that the factor $\mathcal{R}$ can be expressed in terms of $N$, the number of independent eddies along the line of sight. To be specific, $\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}/\sigma^{2}_{\rho/\rho_{0}}$ is proportional to $\sim 1/N$, due to the averaging effect arising from independent eddies along the line of sight. Second, we show that the factor $\mathcal{R}$ needs to be modified if the dimension of the cloud in the line-of-sight direction is different from that in the perpendicular direction. However, if we express $\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}/\sigma^{2}_{\rho / \rho_{0}}$ in terms of $N$, the expression remains same even in the case the cloud has different dimensions along and perpendicular to the line of sight. Third, when we plot $N\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}$ against $\sigma^{2}_{\rho / \rho_{0}}$, two quantities roughly lie on a single curve regardless of the sonic Mach number, which implies that we can directly obtain the latter from the former. We discuss observational implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Formation of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Black Holes and Red Stragglers via Hawking Stars in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presently, primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window from $10^{-16}$ M$_\odot$ to $10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ are a popular dark matter candidate. If they exist, some stars would capture them upon formation, and they would slowly accrete the star over gigayears. Such Hawking stars -- stars with a central PBH -- provide a novel channel for the formation of both sub-Chandrasekhar mass black holes as well as red straggler stars. Here we report on stellar evolution models that extend our previous work to Hawking stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.4 M$_\odot$. We explore three accretion schemes, and find that a wide range of PBHs in the asteroid-mass window can robustly accrete stars as small as 1 M$_{\odot}$ within the age of the Universe. This mechanism of producing sub-solar mass black holes is highly dependent on the assumed accretion physics and stellar metallicity. Lower-metallicity stars are generally accreted more rapidly, suggesting that it may be more likely for sub-Chandrasekhar mass Hawking stars formed in the early universe, such as those in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, to transmute their star into a sub-Chandrasekhar mass black hole within a Hubble time. We present a stellar population synthesis of a Draco II-like UFD galaxy containing Hawking stars and show that the number of red stragglers they produce can qualitatively match the observed population.</description>

      <title>GATOS: missing molecular gas in the outflow of NGC5728 revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionisation cones of NGC5728 have a deficit of molecular gas based on millimetre observations of CO(2-1) emission. Although photoionisation from the active nucleus may lead to suppression of this transition, warm molecular gas can still be present. We report the detection of eight mid-infrared rotational H$_2$ lines throughout the central kiloparsec, including the ionisation cones, using integral field spectroscopic observations with JWST/MIRI MRS. The H$_2$ line ratios, characteristic of a power-law temperature distribution, indicate that the gas is warmest where it enters the ionisation cone through disk rotation, suggestive of shock excitation. In the nucleus, where the data can be combined with an additional seven ro-vibrational H$_2$ transitions, we find that moderate velocity (30 km s$^{-1}$) shocks in dense ($10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) gas, irradiated by an external UV field ($G_0 = 10^3$), do provide a good match to the full set. The warm molecular gas in the ionisation cone that is traced by the H$_2$ rotational lines has been heated to temperatures $&gt;200$ K. Outside of the ionisation cone the molecular gas kinematics are undisturbed. However, within the ionisation cone, the kinematics are substantially perturbed, indicative of a radial flow, but one that is quantitatively different from the ionised lines. We argue that this outflow is in the plane of the disk, implying a short 50 pc acceleration zone up to speeds of about 400 km s$^{-1}$ followed by an extended deceleration over $\sim$700 pc where it terminates. The deceleration is due to both the radially increasing galaxy mass, and mass-loading as ambient gas in the disk is swept up.</description>

      <title>Importance of Initial Condition on Bar Secular Evolution: Role of Halo Angular Momentum Distribution Discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark matter halo properties, for example, mass, spin and concentration play a significant role in the formation and evolution of bars in disk galaxies. This study highlights the importance of a new parameter: the dark matter halo angular momentum distribution in the central region of disk. We experiment with N-body galaxy models having a disk and dark matter similar to Milky Way-type galaxies. In these models, we vary the discontinuity of the angular momentum distribution of the halo (the total spin is the same for all models). Our N-body experiments suggest that bar forms in all models after a few Gyr of disk evolution. However, in the secular evolution of the bar, as we evolve these models until 9.78 Gyr, the bar gains its strength in the model with the most continuous halo angular momentum distribution, and the bar loses strength for the most discontinuous halo angular momentum distribution. The secular evolution of the bar suggests that box/peanut/x-shaped bulges similar to those found in the Milky Way disk should be more pronounced in halos with continuous halo angular momentum distributions. This study demonstrates the importance of the initial condition setup of galaxy systems, namely the discontinuity in the dark matter halo angular momentum distribution for a given density distribution, on the bar secular evolution in the disk galaxy simulations. Further, this study helps reconcile the conflicting results of bar secular evolution in a high-spinning halo of the recent literature.</description>

      <title>Bidimensional Exploration of the warm-Temperature Ionised gaS (BETIS) II. Revisiting the ionisation mechanism of the extraplanar diffuse ionised gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extraplanar diffuse ionised gas is a key component for understanding the feedback processes that connect galactic discs and their halos. In this paper, we present the second study of the BETIS project, which aims to explore the ionisation mechanisms of the eDIG. We use a sample of eight edge-on galaxies observed with MUSE and apply the methodology developed in the first paper of the BETIS project. We found that the vertical and radial profiles of the [NII]/Ha, [SII]/Ha, [OIII]/Hb, and [OI]/Ha ratios depict a complex ionisation structure within galactic halos, influenced by the spatial distribution of HII regions across the galactic plane as observed from our line of sigh, with photon leakage from OB associations constituting the main ionisation source. Our analysis excludes low-mass, hot, and evolved stars as viable candidates for secondary ionisation sources to elucidate the unusual behaviour of the line ratios at greater distances from the galactic midplane. In contrast, we ascertain that shocks induced in the interstellar medium by star formation related feedback mechanisms represent a promising secondary ionisation source of the eDIG. We present a suite of models integrating ionisation mechanisms arising from fast shocks and photoionisation associated with star formation. When applied to the classical BPT diagrams, these models reveal that the ionisation budget of the eDIG ranges from 20% to 50% across our sample, with local variations of up to 20% within individual galaxy halos. This correlates with the presence of filaments and other structural components observed within galaxy halos. The presence of shocks is additionally supported by the observation of high-density, high [OI]/Ha ratios, characteristic of shock-compressed ionised gas, likely induced by feedback from regions of intense SF within the disk. These results are consistent across all galaxies analysed in this sample.</description>

      <title>CANUCS: UV and Ionising Properties of Dwarf Star Forming Galaxies at z = 5 to 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epoch of reionisation progressed through the emission of ionising photons from galaxies to their local intergalactic medium. In this work, we characterise the dwarf star-forming galaxies as candidates for the source of ionising photons that drove EoR. We investigate the ionising properties and star formation histories of star-forming dwarf galaxies at the last stages of EoR at $4.8&lt;\rm{z}&lt;7$ using observations from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The magnification due to gravitational lensing allows us to probe large dynamic ranges in stellar mass ($2\times 10^{6}\leq\rm{M}_*/\rm{M}_\odot\leq5\times 10^{9}$) and UV magnitudes ($-22.68\leq$M$_{UV}\leq=-15.95$).We find a median UV slope \buv of $-2. 56\pm0.23$ and the production efficiency of ionising photons $\log$ \xiion $=25.39\pm0.6$ for the full sample ($4.8&lt;\rm{z}&lt;7$) with a median stellar mass of $6.3\pm0.5\times10^{7} \rm{M}_\odot$. We find both \buv and \xiion are marginally correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy, indicating a possible greater contribution of dwarf galaxies to the reionisation of the Universe. We find that on average, galaxies in our sample are experiencing a recent rise/burst of star formation which translates to a higher scatter in \xiion and a large scatter in H$\alpha$ equivalent widths. Finally, we investigate the trends of H$\alpha$ and [OIII]+H$\beta$ EWs with UV magnitude and find M$_{UV}$ is correlated between H$\alpha$ but not with [OIII]+H$\beta$ EWs indicating low metallicities and recent burst in the UV faint galaxies.</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope proper motions of Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters -- I. Catalogues and results for NGC 1850</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present proper motion (PM) measurements for a sample of 23 massive star clusters within the Large Magellanic Cloud using multi-epoch data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We combined archival data from the ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS instruments with observations from a dedicated HST programme, resulting in time baselines between 4.7 and 18.2 yr available for PM determinations. For bright well-measured stars, we achieved nominal PM precisions of 55 $\mu$as/yr down to 11 $\mu$as/yr . To demonstrate the potential and limitations of our PM data set, we analysed the cluster NGC 1850 and showcase a selection of different science applications. The precision of the PM measurements allows us to disentangle the kinematics of the various stellar populations that are present in the HST field. The cluster has a centre-of-mass motion that is different from the surrounding old field stars and also differs from the mean motion of a close-by group of very young stars. We determined the velocity dispersion of field stars to be 0.128 +/- 0.003 mas/yr (corresponding to 30.3 +/- 0.7 km/s). The velocity dispersion of the cluster inferred from the PM data set most probably overestimates the true value, suggesting that the precision of the measurements at this stage is not sufficient for a reliable analysis of the internal kinematics of extra-galactic star clusters. Finally, we exploit the PM-cleaned catalogue of likely cluster members to determine any radial segregation between fast and slowly-rotating stars, finding that the former are more centrally concentrated. With this paper, we also release the astro-photometric catalogues for each cluster.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from mergers of Population III binary black holes: roles played by two evolution channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signal from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a promising probe of Population III (Pop III) stars. To fully unleash the power of the GW probe, one important step is to understand the relative importance and features of different BBH evolution channels. We model two channels, isolated binary stellar evolution (IBSE) and nuclear star cluster-dynamical hardening (NSC-DH), in one theoretical framework based on the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH, under various assumptions on Pop III initial mass function (IMF), initial binary statistics and high-$z$ nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The NSC-DH channel contributes $\sim 8-95\%$ of Pop III BBH mergers across cosmic history, with higher contributions achieved by initially wider binary stars, more top-heavy IMFs, and more abundant high-$z$ NSCs. The dimensionless stochastic GW background (SGWB) produced by Pop III BBH mergers has peak values $\Omega^{\rm peak}_{\rm GW}\sim 10^{-11}-8\times 10^{-11}$ around observer-frame frequencies $\nu\sim 10-100\ \rm Hz$. The Pop III contribution can be a non-negligible ($\sim 2-32\%$) component in the total SGWB at $\nu\lesssim 10\ \rm Hz$. The estimated detection rates of Pop III BBH mergers by the Einstein Telescope are $\sim 6-230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ and $\sim 30-1230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for the NSC-DH and IBSE channels, respectively. Pop III BBH mergers in NSCs are more massive than those from IBSE, so they dominate the Pop III SGWB below $20$ Hz in most cases. Besides, the detection rate of Pop III BBH mergers involving at least one intermediate-mass BH above $100\ \rm M_\odot$ by the Einstein Telescope is $\sim 0.5-200\ \rm yr^{-1}$ in NSCs but remains below $0.1\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for IBSE.</description>

      <title>Imaging of I Zw 18 by JWST: II. Spatially resolved star formation history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blue compact dwarf galaxy I Zw 18 is one of the most metal-poor ($Z \sim 3% Z_{\sun}$) star-forming galaxies in the local Universe. Its evolutionary status has sparked debate within the astronomical community. We aim to investigate the stellar populations of I Zw 18 in the near-IR using JWST/NIRCam's high spatial resolution and sensitivity. Additionally, we aim to derive the galaxy's spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) over the last 1 Gyr and provide constraints for older epochs. We used DOLPHOT to measure positions and fluxes of point sources in the F115W and F200W filters' images of I Zw 18. To derive I Zw 18's SFH, we applied the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting technique SFERA 2.0, using two independent sets of stellar models. Our analysis reveals three main stellar populations: one younger than $\sim30$ Myr, mainly in the northwest star-forming (SF) region; an intermediate-age population ($\sim 100 - 800$ Myr) in the southeast SF region; and a red and faint population linked to the underlying halo, older than 1 Gyr and possibly as old as 13.8 Gyr. The main body of the galaxy shows a very low star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1}$ between 1 and 13.8 Gyr ago. In the last billion years, I Zw 18 shows increasing SF, with strong bursts around $\sim10$ and $\sim100$ Myr ago. Component C mirrors the main body's evolution but with lower SFRs. Our findings confirm that I Zw 18 contains stars of all ages, indicating it is not a young galaxy but has an old stellar halo, similar to other BCDs. The low SF activity over the past billion years supports the "slow cooking" dwarf scenario, explaining its low metal content. Currently, the galaxy is undergoing its strongest SF episode ($\sim 0.6 M_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1}$) mainly in the northwest region, likely due to a recent gravitational interaction with Component C.</description>

      <title>First resolved stellar halo kinematics of a MW-mass galaxy outside the Local Group: A flat counter-rotating halo in NGC 4945</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar halos of galaxies, primarily formed through the accretion of smaller objects, are important to understand the hierarchical mass assembly of galaxies. However, the inner regions of stellar halos in disk galaxies are predicted to have an in-situ component that is expected to be prominent along the major axis. Kinematic information is crucial to disentangle the contribution of the in-situ component from the accreted stellar halos. The low surface brightness of stellar halos makes it inaccessible with traditional integrated light spectroscopy. In this work, using a novel technique, we study the kinematics of the stellar halo of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4945. We couple new deep Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopic observations with existing Hubble Space Telescope imaging data to spectroscopically measure the line-of-sight (LOS) heliocentric velocity and velocity dispersion in two fields at a galactocentric distance of 12.2 kpc (outer disk field) and 34.6 kpc (stellar halo field) along NGC 4945 major axis, by stacking individual spectra of red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch stars. We obtain a LOS velocity and dispersion of 673+/-11 km/s and 73+/-14 km/s, respectively, for the outer disk field. This is consistent with the mean HI velocity of the disk at that distance. For the halo field we obtain a LOS velocity and dispersion of 519+/-12 km/s and 42+/-22 km/s. The halo fields' velocity measurement is within ~40 km/s from the systemic LOS velocity of NGC 4945, which is 563 km/s, suggesting that its stellar halo at 34.6 kpc along the major axis is counter-rotating and is of likely accretion origin. This provides the first ever kinematic measurement of the stellar halo of a Milky Way-mass galaxy outside the Local Group from its resolved stellar population, and establishes a powerful technique for measuring the velocity field of the stellar halos of nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>Flux and fluence effects on the Vacuum-UV photodesorption and photoprocessing of CO$_2$ ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CO$_2$ is a major component of the icy mantles surrounding dust grains in planet and star formation regions. Understanding its photodesorption is crucial for explaining gas phase abundances in the coldest environments of the interstellar medium irradiated by vacuum-UV (VUV) photons. Photodesorption yields determined experimentally from CO$_2$ samples grown at low temperatures (T=15~K) have been found to be very sensitive to experimental methods and conditions. Several mechanisms have been suggested for explaining the desorption of CO$_2$, O$_2$ and CO from CO$_2$ ices. In the present study, the cross sections characterizing the dynamics of photodesorption as a function of photon fluence (determined from released molecules in the gas phase) and of ice composition modification (determined in situ in the solid phase) are compared for the first time for different photon flux conditions (from 7.3$\times 10^{12}$~photon/s/cm$^2$ to 2.2$\times 10^{14}$~photon/s/cm$^2$) using monochromatic synchrotron radiation in the VUV range (on the DESIRS beamline at SOLEIL). This approach reveals that CO and O$_2$ desorption are decorrelated from that of CO$_2$. CO and O$_2$ photodesorption yields depend on photon flux conditions and can be linked to surface chemistry. By contrast, the phodesorption yield of CO$_2$ is independent of the photon flux conditions and can be linked to bulk ice chemical modification, consistently with an indirect desorption induced by electronic transition (DIET) process.</description>

      <title>Prior-Informed AGN-Host Spectral Decomposition Using PyQSOFit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an improved method for decomposing the emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies using templates from principal component analysis (PCA). This approach integrates prior information from PCA with a penalized pixel fitting mechanism which improves the precision and effectiveness of the decomposition process. Specifically, we have reduced the degeneracy and over-fitting in AGN-host decomposition, particularly for those with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), where traditional methods tend to fail. By applying our method to 76,565 SDSS Data Release 16 quasars with $z&lt;0.8$, we achieve a success rate of $\approx$ 94%, thus establishing the largest host-decomposed spectral catalog of quasars to date. Our fitting results consider the impact of the host galaxy on the overestimation of the AGN luminosity and black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$). Furthermore, we obtained stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_*$) measurements for 4,137 quasars. The slope of the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation in this subsample is generally consistent with previous quasar studies beyond the local universe. Our method provides a robust and efficient approach to disentangle the AGN and host galaxy components across a wide range of SNRs and redshifts.</description>

      <title>The wave-like disk oscillations of mono-age stellar populations in the Solar neighbourhood from Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The North-South asymmetry in the number density and bulk velocity of stars in the solar neighborhood provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the Milky Way disk. Our objective is to investigate the wave-like disk oscillations of mono-age stellar populations in the Solar neighbourhood using data from Gaia Data Release 3. We have selected a comprehensive sample of main sequence turn off stars. The ages of these stars can be accurately determined using isochrone fitting methods. Our findings indicate that the north-south density and mean vertical velocity asymmetries remain consistent across all age groups.The uniformity of perturbations across all subsamples suggests that all populations are responding to the same external influence, which likely affects them irrespective of their age. Moreover, the fact that these perturbations appear consistently implies they could be either ongoing or recent. Regarding vertical velocity dispersions, we observe that older stars exhibit larger dispersions.</description>

      <title>Optical Spectropolarimetric Variability Properties in Blazars PKS 0637-75 and PKS 1510-089</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetry is a powerful tool to investigate the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as polarization signatures are key to probing magnetic field structure, evolution, and the physics of particle acceleration in jets. Optical linear polarization of blazars is typically greater than a few percent, indicating the emission is dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation, while polarization less than a few percent is common for other type 1 AGNs. We present a spectropolarimetric study of PKS 0637-75 and PKS 1510-089 to determine how the head-on orientation of a jet and dominant emission processes influence polarimetric variations in the broad lines and continuum. Observations were obtained biweekly from the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on the Southern African Large Telescope. Variability in the continuum polarization is detected for both PKS 0637-75 and PKS 1510-089, with a total average level of 2.5% +/- 0.1% and 7.5% +/- 0.1%, respectively. There is no clear polarization in the broad Balmer emission lines and weak polarization in Mg II as the average level across all observations is 0.2% +/- 0.1% for Hbeta, 0.2% +/- 0.3% for Hgamma, and 0.6% +/- 0.2% for Mg II. We find that polarization measurements confirm the conclusions drawn from spectral energy distribution modeling of the disk-jet contributions to the emission as optical polarization and time variability for PKS 0637-75 are shown to be dominated by accretion disk emission while those of PKS 1510-089 are due to both disk and jet emission, with greater jet contribution during flaring states.</description>

      <title>The Size-Mass relation at Rest-Frame $1.5\mu$m from JWST/NIRCam in the COSMOS-WEB and PRIMER-COSMOS fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the galaxy stellar mass - size relation in the rest-frame near-IR ($1.5~\mu{\text{m}}$) and its evolution with redshift up to $z=2.5$. S\'ersic profiles are measured for $\sim$ $26\,000$ galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star &gt; 10^9~{\text{M}}_\odot$ from JWST/NIRCam F277W and F444W imaging provided by the COSMOS-WEB and PRIMER surveys, using coordinates, redshifts, colors and stellar mass estimates from the COSMOS2020 catalog. The new rest-frame near-IR effective radii are generally smaller than previously measured rest-frame optical sizes, on average by 0.14~dex, with no significant dependence on redshift. For quiescent galaxies this size offset does not depend on stellar mass, but for star-forming galaxies the offset increases from -0.1~dex at $M_\star = 10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot$ to -0.25~dex at $M_\star &gt; 10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot$. That is, we find that the near-IR stellar mass - size relation for star-forming galaxies is flatter in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at all redshifts $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$. The general pace of size evolution is the same in the near-IR as previously demonstrated in the optical, with slower evolution ($R_{\text{e}} \propto (1+z)^{-0.7}$) for $L^*$~star-forming galaxies and faster evolution ($R_{\text{e}} \propto (1+z)^{-1.3}$) for $L^*$~quiescent galaxies. Massive ($M_\star&gt;10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot$) star-forming galaxies evolve in size almost as fast as quiescent galaxies. Low-mass ($M_\star&lt;10^{10}~{\text{M}}_\odot$)~quiescent galaxies evolve as slow as star-forming galaxies. Our main conclusion is that the size evolution narrative as it has emerged over the past two decades does not radically change when accessing with JWST the rest-frame near-IR, a better proxy of the underlying stellar mass distribution.</description>

Abstract: Aromatic molecules represent fundamental building blocks in prebiotic chemistry and are contemplated as vital precursors to DNA and RNA nitrogen bases. However, despite the identification of some 300 molecules in extraterrestrial environments, the pathways to pyridine (C5H5N), pyridinyl (C5H4N), and (iso)quinoline (C9H7N) the simplest representative of mono and bicyclic aromatic molecule carrying nitrogen are elusive. Here, we afford compelling evidence on the gas phase formation of methylene amidogen (H2CN) and cyanomethyl (H2CCN) radicals via molecular beam studies and electronic structure calculations. The modeling of the chemistries of Taurus Molecular Cloud (TMC 1) and Titans atmosphere contemplates a complex chain of reactions synthesizing pyridine, pyridinyl, and (iso)quinoline from H2CN and H2CCN at levels of up to 75%. This study affords unique entry points to precursors of DNA and RNA nitrogen bases in hydrocarbon rich extraterrestrial environments thus changing the way we think about the origin of prebiotic molecules in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Binding energies of ethanol and ethylamine on interstellar water ices: synergy between theory and experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental and computational chemistry are two disciplines to conduct research in Astrochemistry, providing essential reference data for both astronomical observations and modeling. These approaches not only mutually support each other, but also serve as complementary tools to overcome their respective limitations. We characterized the binding energies (BEs) of ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH) and ethylamine (CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$), two interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs), onto crystalline and amorphous water ices through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. Experimentally, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ behave similarly, in which desorption temperatures are higher on the water ices than on a bare gold surface. Computed cohesive energies of pure ethanol and ethylamine bulk structures allow describing the BEs of the pure species deposited on the gold surface, as extracted from the TPD curve analyses. The BEs of submonolayer coverages of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ on the water ices cannot be directly extracted from TPD due to their co-desorption with water, but they are computed through DFT calculations, and found to be greater than the cohesive energy of water. The behaviour of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ is different when depositing adsorbate multilayers on the amorphous ice, in that, according to their computed cohesive energies, ethylamine layers present weaker interactions compared to ethanol and water. Finally, from the computed BEs of ethanol, ethylamine and water, we can infer that the snow-lines of these three species in protoplanetary disks will be situated at different distances from the central star. It appears that a fraction of ethanol and ethylamine is already frozen on the grains in the water snow-lines, causing their incorporation in water-rich planetesimals.</description>

      <title>The HYENAS project: a prediction for the X-ray undetected galaxy groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy groups contain the majority of bound mass with a significant portion of baryons due to the combination of halo mass and abundance (Cui 2024). Hence they serve as a crucial missing piece in the puzzle of galaxy formation and the evolution of large-scale structures in the Universe. In observations, mass-complete group catalogues are normally derived from galaxy redshift surveys detected through various three-dimensional group-finding algorithms. Confirming the reality of such groups, particularly in the X-rays, is critical for ensuring robust studies of galaxy evolution in these environments. Recent works have reported numerous optical groups that are X-ray undetected (see, e.g., Popesso et al. 2024), sparking debates regarding the reasons for the unexpectedly low hot gas fraction in galaxy groups. To address this issue, we utilise zoomed-in simulations of galaxy groups from the novel HYENAS project to explore the range of hot gas fractions within galaxy groups and investigate the intrinsic factors behind the observed variability in X-ray emission. We find that the halo formation time can play a critical role -- we see that groups in halos that formed earlier exhibit up to an order of magnitude brighter X-ray luminosities compared to those formed later. This suggests that undetected X-ray groups are preferentially late-formed halos and highlights the connection between gas fraction and halo formation time in galaxy groups. Accounting for these biases in galaxy group identification is essential for advancing our understanding of galaxy formation and achieving precision in cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>Ticking away: the long-term X-ray timing and spectral evolution of eRO-QPE2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeated X-ray flares from galactic nuclei. Despite some diversity in the recurrence and amplitude of eruptions, their striking regularity has motivated theorists to associate QPEs with orbital systems. Among the known QPE sources, eRO-QPE2 has shown the most regular flare timing and luminosity since its discovery. We report here on its long-term evolution over $\sim3.3\,$yr from discovery and find that: i) the average QPE recurrence time per epoch has decreased over time, albeit not at a uniform rate; ii) the distinct alternation between consecutive long and short recurrence times found at discovery has not been significant since; iii) the spectral properties, namely flux and temperature of both eruptions and quiescence components, have remained remarkably consistent within uncertainties. We attempted to interpret these results as orbital period and eccentricity decay coupled with orbital and disk precession. However, since gaps between observations are too long, we are not able to distinguish between an evolution dominated by just a decreasing trend, or by large modulations (e.g. due to the precession frequencies at play). In the former case, the observed period decrease is roughly consistent with that of a star losing orbital energy due to hydrodynamic gas drag from disk collisions, although the related eccentricity decay is too fast and additional modulations have to contribute too. In the latter case, no conclusive remarks are possible on the orbital evolution and the nature of the orbiter due to the many effects at play. However, these two cases come with distinctive predictions for future X-ray data: in the former, we expect all future observations to show a shorter recurrence time than the latest epoch, while in the latter we expect some future observations to be found with a larger recurrence, hence an apparent temporary period increase.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters has emerged as a powerful tool to probe the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm of structure formation in the Universe. Despite the remarkable explanatory power of CDM on large scales, tensions with observations on small scales have been reported. Recent studies find that the observational cross-section for Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing (GGSL) in clusters exceeds the CDM prediction by more than an order of magnitude, and persists even after rigorous examination of various possible systematics. We investigate the impact of modifying the internal structure of cluster dark matter sub-halos on GGSL and report that altering the inner density profile, given by $r^{\gamma}$, to steeper slopes with $\gamma &gt; 2.5$ can alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. Deviating from the $\gamma \sim 1.0$ cusps that CDM predicts, these steeper slopes could arise in models of self-interacting dark matter undergoing core collapse. Our results motivate additional study of sub-halo core collapse in dense cluster environments.</description>

      <title>The true nature of HE0057-5959, the most metal-poor Li-rich star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Li-rich stars are a class of rare objects with A(Li) higher than that of other stars in the same evolutionary stage. Their origin is still debated and valuable routes are the Cameron-Fowler mechanism, mass transfer process in a binary system or engulfment of small bodies. Metal-poor ([Fe/H]&lt;-1 dex) stars are only a small fraction of the entire population of Li-rich stars. We observed with MIKE at the Magellan Telescope the metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-3.95+-0.11 dex) giant star HE0057-5959, deriving A(Li)=+2.09+-0.07 dex. Such A(Li) is higher by about 1 dex than that of other stars in the same evolutionary stage. A previous analysis of the same target suggested that its high A(Li) reflects a still ongoing First Dredge-Up process. We revise the nature of HE0057-5959 by comparing its stellar parameters and A(Li) with appropriate stellar evolution models. This comparison rules out that HE0057-5959 is caught during its First Dredge-Up, being this latter already ended according to the parameters of this star. Its A(Li), remarkably higher than the typical lithium plateau drawn by similar giant stars, demonstrates that HE0057-5959 joins the class of the rare metal-poor Li-rich stars. HE0057-5959 is the most metal-poor Li-rich star discovered so far. We consider different scenarios to explain this star. No internal mixing able to activate the Cameron-Fowler mechanism is known for metal-poor stars at this evolutionary stage. Also the engulfment of planets is disfavored because such metal-poor stars should not host planets. Finally, HE0057-5959 is one of the most Na-rich among the Li-rich stars and we found that a strong excess of Na is common to the three Li-rich stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-3 dex. This finding could support the scenario of mass transfer from a massive companion star in a binary system, even if we found no evidence of radial velocity variations.</description>

      <title>Impact of extragalactic point sources on the low-frequency sky spectrum and cosmic dawn global 21-cm measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contribution of resolved and unresolved extragalactic point sources to the low-frequency sky spectrum is a potentially non-negligible part of the astrophysical foregrounds for cosmic dawn 21-cm experiments. The clustering of such point sources on the sky, combined with the frequency-dependence of the antenna beam, can also make this contribution chromatic. By combining low-frequency measurements of the luminosity function and the angular correlation function of extragalactic point sources, we develop a model for the contribution of these sources to the low-frequency sky spectrum. Using this model, we find that the contribution of sources with flux density $&gt;10^{-6}\,$Jy to the sky-averaged spectrum is smooth and of the order of a few kelvins at 50 - $200\,$MHz. We combine this model with measurements of the galactic foreground spectrum and convolve the result with the beam of the conical log-spiral antenna planned as part of the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) project. We find that the contribution of point sources to resultant spectrum is $\sim0.4\%$ of the total foregrounds, but still larger by at least an order of magnitude than the standard predictions for the cosmological 21-cm signal. As a result, not accounting for the point-source contribution leads to a systematic bias in 21-cm signal recovery. We show, however, that in the REACH case, this reconstruction bias can be removed by modelling the point-source contribution as a power law with a running spectral index. We make our code publicly available as a Python package labelled epspy.</description>

Abstract: Filaments connecting halos are a long-standing prediction of cold dark matter theories. We present a novel detection of the cosmic web emission connecting two massive quasar-host galaxies at cosmic noon in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF) using unprecedentedly deep observations that unlock a high-definition view of the filament morphology, a measure of the transition radius between the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium, and the characterization of the surface brightness profiles along the filament and in the transverse direction. Through systematic comparisons with simulations, we validate the filaments' typical density predicted in the current cold dark matter model. Our analysis of the MUDF field, an excellent laboratory for quantitatively studying filaments in emission, opens a new avenue to understanding the cosmic web that, being a fundamental prediction of cosmology, bears key information on the essence of dark matter.</description>

      <title>At First Sight: Zero-Shot Classification of Astronomical Images with Large Multimodal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language multimodal Models (VLMs) offer the possibility for zero-shot classification in astronomy: i.e. classification via natural language prompts, with no training. We investigate two models, GPT-4o and LLaVA-NeXT, for zero-shot classification of low-surface brightness galaxies and artifacts, as well as morphological classification of galaxies. We show that with natural language prompts these models achieved significant accuracy (above 80 percent typically) without additional training/fine tuning. We discuss areas that require improvement, especially for LLaVA-NeXT, which is an open source model. Our findings aim to motivate the astronomical community to consider VLMs as a powerful tool for both research and pedagogy, with the prospect that future custom-built or fine-tuned models could perform better.</description>

      <title>Primordial Lithium from Globular Cluster Turn-Off Stars: M13 AND M71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the first 15 minutes of the Universe some $^7$Li was created along with isotopes of H and He. The determination of that primordial value of Li can help constrain the conditions at that time. The oldest stars with known ages can be found in globular clusters which have well-determined ages through stellar evolution models. High-resolution spectra have been obtained with the Keck I telescope and HIRES of Li in several unevolved stars in the clusters M13 and M71 with V magnitudes of 17.6 -- 17.9. Abundances of Li have been determined with spectrum synthesis techniques and show a range of a factor of 4. We attribute that spread to differences in initial angular momentum resulting in different amounts of spin-down, related mixing, and destruction of Li. Our results are compared with similar results for main-sequences and turn-off stars in other globular clusters. The range in age of these clusters is 11.2 to 14.2 Gyr for an age span of 3 Gyr. These clusters range in [Fe/H] from $-$0.75 to $-$2.24 corresponding to a factor of 30 in metallicity. The maximum in the Li abundance for these unevolved stars in all eight clusters is the same corresponding to Li/H = 3.16 x 10$^{-10}$ while the predicted Li abundance, based on the deuterium abundance and the BBN predictions, is 5.24 x 10$^{-10}$.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Highly Ionized Outflow in the Quasi-periodically Erupting Source GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts recurring every few hours, associated with supermassive black holes. Many interpretations for QPEs were proposed since their recent discovery in 2019, including extreme mass ratio inspirals and accretion disk instabilities. But, as of today, their nature still remains debated. We perform the first high-resolution X-ray spectral study of a QPE source using the RGS gratings onboard XMM-Newton, leveraging nearly 2 Ms of exposure on GSN 069, the first discovered source of this class. We resolve several absorption and emission lines including a strong line pair near the N VII rest-frame energy, resembling the P-Cygni profile. We apply photoionization spectral models and identify the absorption lines as an outflow blueshifted by $1700-2900$ km/s, with a column density of about $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and an ionization parameter $\log (\xi$/erg cm s$^{-1})$ of $3.9-4.6$. The emission lines are instead redshifted by up to 2900 km/s, and likely originate from the same outflow that imprints the absorption features, and covers the full $4\pi$ sky from the point of view of GSN 069. The column density and ionization are comparable to the outflows detected in some tidal disruption events, but this outflow is significantly faster and has a strong emission component. The outflow is more highly ionized when the system is in the phase during which QPEs are present, and from the limits we derive on its location, we conclude that the outflow is connected to the recent complex, transient activity of GSN 069 which began around 2010.</description>

      <title>Binary Yellow Supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds I: Photometric Candidate Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have constrained the binary fraction of evolved populations of massive stars in local galaxies such as red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars, but the binary fraction of yellow supergiants (YSGs) in the Hertzsprung Gap remains unconstrained. Binary evolution theory predicts that the Hertzsprung Gap is home to multiple populations of binary systems with varied evolutionary histories. In this paper, we develop a method to distinguish single YSGs from YSG plus O- or B-type main sequence binaries using optical and ultraviolet photometry, and then apply this method to identify candidate YSG binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. After constructing a set of combined stellar atmosphere models, we find that optical photometry is, given typical measurement and reddening uncertainties, sufficient to discern single YSGs from YSG+OB binaries if the OB-star is at least $\sim5$M$_{\odot}$ for T$_{\mathrm{eff,YSG}}\sim$ 4000 K, but requires a $\sim$20M$_{\odot}$ OB star for YSGs up to T$_{\mathrm{eff,YSG}}\sim$ 9000 K. For these hotter YSG temperatures, ultraviolet photometry allows binaries with OB companions as small as $\sim$7M$_{\odot}$ to be identified. We use color-color spaces developed from these models to search for evidence of excess blue or ultraviolet light in a set of $\sim$1000 YSG candidates in the Magellanic Clouds. We identify hundreds of candidate YSG binary systems and report a preliminary fraction of YSGs that show a blue/UV color excess of 20-60\%. Spectroscopic follow-up is now required to confirm the true nature of this population.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution of Complex Organic Molecules in Turbulent Protoplanetary Disks: Effect of stochastic UV irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the chemical evolution of complex organic molecules (COMs) in turbulent disks using gas-ice chemical reaction network simulations. We trace trajectories of dust particles considering advection, turbulent diffusion, gas drag, and vertical settling, for 10$^6$ yrs in a protoplanetary disk. Then, we solve a gas-ice chemical reaction network along the trajectories and obtain the temporal evolution of molecular abundances. We find that the COM abundances in particles can differ by more than two orders of magnitude even when the UV fluence (i.e., the time integral of UV flux) received by the particles are similar, suggesting that not only the UV fluence but also the time variation of the UV flux does matter for the evolution of COMs in disks. The impact of UV fluence on molecular abundances differs between oxygen-bearing and nitrogen-bearing COMs. While higher UV fluence results in oxygen being locked into CO$_2$, leading to reduced abundances of oxygen-bearing COMs such as CH$_3$OCH$_3$, mild UV exposure can promote their formation by supplying the precursor radicals. On the other hand, nitrogen is not locked up into specific molecules, allowing the formation of nitrogen-bearing COMs, particularly CH$_3$NH$_2$, even for the particle that receives the higher UV fluence. We also find that the final COM abundances are mostly determined by the inherited abundances from the protostellar core when the UV fluence received by dust particles is less than a critical value, while they are set by both the inherited abundances and the chemistry inside the disk at higher UV fluence.</description>

      <title>Local Spherical Collapsing Box in Athena++: Numerical Implementation and Benchmark Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a local model for a spherical collapsing/expanding gas cloud into the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamic code. This local model consists of a Cartesian periodic box with time-dependent geometry. We present a series of benchmark test problems, including non-linear solutions and linear perturbations of the local model, confirming the code's desired performance. During a spherical collapse, a horizontal shear flow is amplified, corresponding to angular momentum conservation of zonal flows in the global problem; wave speed and amplitude of sound waves increase in the local frame, due to the reduction in the characteristic length scale of the box, which can lead to an anisotropic effective sound speed in the local box. Our code conserves both mass and momentum to machine precision. This numerical implementation of the local model has potential applications to the study of local physics and hydrodynamic instabilities during protostellar collapse, providing a powerful framework for better understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity VIII. Stellar and wind parameters of newly revealed stripped stars in Be binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the route towards merging neutron stars and stripped-envelope supernovae, binary population synthesis predicts a large number of post-interaction systems with massive stars that have stripped off their outer layers. Yet, observations of such stars in the intermediate-mass regime below the Wolf-Rayet masses are rare. Using X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) data, we discovered three partially stripped star + Be/Oe binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. We analyzed the UV and optical spectra using the PoWR model atmosphere code by superimposing model spectra corresponding to each component. The estimated current masses of the partially stripped stars fall within the intermediate mass range of 4-8 $M_{\odot}$. These objects are overluminous for their stellar masses, matching core He-burning luminosities. Their Be/Oe secondaries have much higher masses than their stripped primaries (mass ratio &gt; 2). All three partially stripped stars show significant nitrogen enrichment and carbon and oxygen depletion on their surfaces. Additionally, one of our sample stars exhibits significant helium enrichment. Our study provides the first comprehensive determination of the wind parameters of partially stripped stars in the intermediate mass range. The wind mass-loss rates of these stars are found to be on the order of $10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is over ten times higher than that of OB stars of the same luminosity. Current evolutionary models characterizing this phase typically employ OB or WR mass-loss rates, which underestimate or overestimate stripped stars' mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude. Binary evolution models indicate that the observed primaries had initial masses of 12-17 $M_{\odot}$, making them potential candidates for stripped-envelope supernovae that form neutron stars. If they survive the explosion, these systems may become Be X-ray binaries and later double neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Accessing a New Population of Supermassive Black Holes with Extensions to the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope has produced resolved images of the supermassive black holes Sgr A* and M87*, which present the largest shadows on the sky. In the next decade, technological improvements and extensions to the array will enable access to a greater number of sources, unlocking studies of a larger population of supermassive black holes through direct imaging. In this paper, we identify 12 of the most promising sources beyond Sgr A* and M87* based on their angular size and millimeter flux density. For each of these sources, we make theoretical predictions for their observable properties by ray tracing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic models appropriately scaled to each target's mass, distance, and flux density. We predict that these sources would have somewhat higher Eddington ratios than M87*, which may result in larger optical and Faraday depths than previous EHT targets. Despite this, we find that visibility amplitude size constraints can plausibly recover masses within a factor of 2, although the unknown jet contribution remains a significant uncertainty. We find that the linearly polarized structure evolves substantially with Eddington ratio, with greater evolution at larger inclinations, complicating potential spin inferences for inclined sources. We discuss the importance of 345 GHz observations, milli-Jansky baseline sensitivity, and independent inclination constraints for future observations with upgrades to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) through ground updates with the next-generation EHT (ngEHT) program and extensions to space through the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX).</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic and Dynamic Orbital Analyses of Metal-Poor and High Proper Motion Stars: I. HD\,8724 and HD\,195633</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, spectral, age, kinematic, and orbital dynamical analyses were conducted on metal-poor and high proper-motion (HPM) stars, HD 8724 and HD 195633, selected from the Solar neighborhood. This analysis combines detailed abundance measurements, kinematics, and orbital dynamics to determine their origin. Standard 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis provides a fresh determination of the atmospheric parameters: $T_{\rm eff}=$4700$\pm$115 K, $\log g=$ 1.65$\pm$0.32 cgs, [Fe/H]=-1.59$\pm$0.04 dex, and a microturbulent velocity $\xi=$ 1.58$\pm$0.50 km s$^{\rm -1}$ for HD 8724 and $T_{\rm eff}=$6100$\pm$205 K, $\log g=$3.95$\pm$0.35 cgs, [Fe/H]=-0.52$\pm$0.05 dex, and $\xi=$1.26$\pm$0.50 km s$^{\rm -1}$ for HD 195633. The ages were estimated using a Bayesian approach (12.25 Gyr for HD 8724 and 8.15 Gyr for HD 195633). The escape scenarios of these stars from 170 candidate globular clusters (GCs) in the Galaxy were also investigated because of their chemical and physical differences (HPM and metal-poor nature). Accordingly, the calculated probability of encounter ($59\%$) for HD 8724 at a distance of five tidal radius suggests that star HD 8724 may have escaped from NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), supported by its highly flattened orbit and may belong to a sub-population of this GC. Conversely, HD 195633's kinematics, age, and metal abundances point towards an escape from the bulge GC NGC 6356.</description>

      <title>The AstroSat UV Deep Field North: Direct determination of the UV Luminosity Function and its evolution from z~0.8-0.4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the evolution of the rest-frame 1500 $\unicode{xC5}$ UV luminosity Function (UVLF) from AstroSat/UVIT F154W and N242W imaging in the Great Observatories Origins Survey North (GOODS-N) field. With deep FUV observations, we construct the UVLF for galaxies at z$&lt;0.13$ and subsequently characterise it with a Schechter function fit. The fitted parameters are consistent with previous determinations. With deep NUV observations, we are able to construct the UVLF in seven redshift bins in the range z $\sim$ 0.8 - 0.4, with galaxies identified till $\sim$2 mag fainter than previous surveys, owing to the high angular-resolution of UVIT. The fitted Schechter function parameters are obtained for these UVLFs. At z $\sim$ 0.8 - 0.7, we also utilize Hubble Space Telescope (HST) F275W observations in the GOODS-N field to construct the UVLF in 2 redshift bins, whose fitted Schechter function parameters are then found to be consistent with that determined from UVIT at z $\sim$ 0.75. We thus probe the variation of the fitted UVLF parameters over z $\sim$ 0.8 - 0.4, a span of $\sim$2.7 Gyr in age. We find that the slope of the Schechter function, $\alpha$, is at its steepest at z $\sim$ 0.65, implying highest star-formation at this instant with galaxies being relatively more passive before and after this time. We infer that this may be a short-lived instance of increased cosmic star-formation even though cosmic star-formation may be winding-down over longer timespan at this redshift range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multi-frequency, multi-epoch catalog of extragalactic sources. The catalog is based on 150, 220, and 280 GHz observations carried out in 2008, 2009, and 2010 using the Millimeter Bolometric Array Camera on the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We also present and release 280 GHz maps from 2008 and 2010. The catalog contains 483 sources found in a sky area of ${\sim}600$ square degrees. It was obtained by cross-matching sources found in 11 sub-catalogs, one for each season and frequency band. We also include co-added data from ${\sim}150$ and ${\sim}160$ square degrees using two and three years of overlapping observations. We divide the sources into two populations, synchrotron and dusty emitters, based on their spectral behavior in the 150-280 GHz frequency range. We find 284 synchrotron sources and 183 dusty source candidates. Our cross-matching with catalogs from radio to X-ray results in 251 synchrotron sources (88%) and 92 dusty sources (51%) with counterparts and suggests that 91 dusty candidates are not in existing catalogs. We study the variability and number counts of each population. In the case of synchrotron sources, we find year-to-year variability, with a mean value around 35%. As expected, we find no evidence of dusty source variability. Our number counts generally agree with previous measurements and models, except for dusty sources at 280 GHz, where some models overestimate our results.</description>

      <title>The Great Escape: Understanding the Connection Between Ly$\alpha$ Emission and LyC Escape in Simulated JWST Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraining the escape fraction of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons from high-redshift galaxies is crucial to understanding reionization. Recent observations have demonstrated that various characteristics of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line correlate with the inferred LyC escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$) of low-redshift galaxies. Using a data-set of 9,600 mock Ly$\alpha$ spectra of star-forming galaxies at $4.64 \leq z \leq 6$ from the SPHINX$^{20}$ cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulation, we study the escape of Ly$\alpha$ and LyC photons. We find that our mock Ly$\alpha$ observations are representative of high-redshift observations and that typical observational methods tend to over-predict the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}$) by as much as two dex. We investigate the correlations between $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ and $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}$, Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width ($W_{\lambda}({\rm Ly\alpha})$), peak separation ($v_{\rm sep}$), central escape fraction ($f_{\rm cen}$), and red peak asymmetry ($A_f^{\rm red}$). We find that $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}$ and $f_{\rm cen}$ are good diagnostics for LyC leakage, selecting for galaxies with lower neutral gas densities and less UV attenuation that have recently experienced supernova feedback. In contrast, $W_{\lambda}({\rm Ly\alpha})$ and $v_{\rm sep}$ are found to be necessary but insufficient diagnostics, while $A_f^{\rm red}$ carries little information. Finally, we use stacks of Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and F150W mock surface brightness profiles to find that galaxies with high $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ have less extended Ly$\alpha$ and F150W but larger H$\alpha$ haloes than their non-leaking counterparts. This confirms that Ly$\alpha$ spectral profiles and surface brightness morphology can be used to better understand the escape of LyC photons from galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>AXES-SDSS: comparison of SDSS galaxy groups with all-sky X-ray extended sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the picture of X-ray emission of groups through the study of systematic differences in the optical properties of groups with and without X-ray emission and study the effect of large-scale density field on scaling relations. We present the identification of X-ray galaxy groups using a combination of RASS and SDSS data. We include new X-ray reanalysis of RASS, to include very extended (up to a size of half a degree) sources and account for differences in the limiting sensitivity towards compact and very extended X-ray emission. X-ray groups exhibit less scatter in the scaling relations and selecting the groups based on the extended X-ray emission leads to an additional scatter reduction. Most of the scatter for the optical groups is associated with a small (6%) fraction of outliers, primarily associated with low optical luminosity groups found in dense regions of the cosmic web. These groups are the primary candidates for being the contaminants in the optical group catalogues. Removing those groups from the optical group sample using optically measured properties only, leads to a substantial reduction in the scatter in the most scaling relations of the optical groups. We find a density dependence of both the X-ray and optical luminosity of groups, which we associate with the assembly bias. Abridged.</description>

      <title>Mapping the anisotropic Galactic stellar halo with Blue Horizontal Branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Legacy Survey photometric data to probe the stellar halo in multiple directions of the sky using a probabilistic methodology to identify Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB) stars. The measured average radial density profile follows a double power law in the range $ 5 &lt; r_{gc}/{\rm kpc} &lt; 120$, with a density break at $r_{gc}\approx20$ kpc. This description, however, falls short, depending on the chosen line-of-sight, with some regions showing no signature of a break in the profile and a wide range of density slopes, e.g. outer slope $-5.5 \lesssim \alpha_{out} \lesssim -4$, pointing towards a highly anisotropic stellar halo. This explains in part the wide range of density profiles reported in the literature owing to different tracers and sky coverage. Using our detailed 3-D stellar halo density map, we quantify the shape of the Pisces overdensity associated with the transient wake response of the Galaxy's (dark) halo to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Measured in the LMC's coordinate system, Pisces stands above the background, is 60 degrees long and 25 degrees wide and aligned with the LMC's orbit. This would correspond to a wake width of $\sim 32$ kpc at $\sim 70$ kpc. We do not find a statistically significant signature of the collective response in density as previously reported in the literature measured with K giant stars, despite our larger numbers. We release the catalogue constructed in this study with 95,446 possible BHB stars and their BHB probability.</description>

      <title>The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array V. Search for continuous gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for continuous gravitational wave signals (CGWs) in the second data release (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) collaboration. The most significant candidate event from this search has a gravitational wave frequency of 4-5 nHz. Such a signal could be generated by a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the local Universe. We present the results of a follow-up analysis of this candidate using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. The Bayesian analysis gives a Bayes factor of 4 in favor of the presence of the CGW over a common uncorrelated noise process, while the frequentist analysis estimates the p-value of the candidate to be 1%, also assuming the presence of common uncorrelated red noise. However, comparing a model that includes both a CGW and a gravitational wave background (GWB) to a GWB only, the Bayes factor in favour of the CGW model is only 0.7. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the origin of the observed feature, but we cannot rule it out as a CGW source. We present results of simulations that demonstrate that data containing a weak gravitational wave background can be misinterpreted as data including a CGW and vice versa, providing two plausible explanations of the EPTA DR2 data. Further investigations combining data from all PTA collaborations will be needed to reveal the true origin of this feature.</description>
