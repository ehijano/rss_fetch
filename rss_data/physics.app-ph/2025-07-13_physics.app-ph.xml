      <title>Experimental and numerical study on current distribution in parallel co-wound no-insulation coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No-insulation (NI) coils are known for their high thermal stability and self-protection features due to turn-to-turn contacts. Parallel co-winding is a promising method to reduce the charging delay of NI coils while maintaining thermal stability, demonstrating significant potential for applications in fusion and other large-scale or high-field magnets. The non-uniform current distribution among parallel superconducting tapes in parallel co-wound NI coils may lead to thermal and mechanical stability issues. In this work, we conducted current measurement experiments on small parallel co-wound NI REBCO coils to investigate the non-uniform current distribution and its influencing factors. The parallel tapes in the input and output sections of the test coils were separated and a series of Rogowski coils was used to measure the current in each tape during ramping charging process. We combined a field-circuit coupled model based on the T-A formulation with an equivalent circuit model to calculate the current distribution in co-wound coils. Both the measured and calculated results indicated that the current distribution during ramping was highly non-uniform, with some tapes carrying reverse currents. We calculated the current distribution in co-wound coils with different insulation methods and analyzed the influencing factors of the reverse current. The influence of the terminal resistance on current distribution was also discussed. This work could contribute to a deeper understanding of current distribution behavior in co-wound coils and provide insights for their application in large-scale or high-field magnet systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Magnetometer based on Cusp Points of the Photon-Magnon Synchronization Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasensitive magnetometers based on spin resonances have led to remarkable achievements. However, the gyromagnetic ratios of these spin resonances that determine the responsivity of magnetometers to weak magnetic fields are inherently constrained by the Land$\acute{e}$ g-factor of particles, such as the electron, with a constant gyromagnetic ratio of $\gamma_e=2\pi\times28$ GHz/T. Here, we demonstrate an ultrasensitive magnetometer based on the cusp point (CP) of photon-magnon synchronization modes (PMSMs). The PMSM's gyromagnetic ratio at the CP is enhanced to $37\gamma_e$ and further amplified to $236\gamma_e$ by utilizing the sixth-order oscillating mode of the PMSM. Moreover, the emission linewidth of the PMSM can be reduced to 0.06 Hz, resulting in excellent sensitivity to weak magnetic fields. These outstanding properties position our magnetometer to potentially achieve superior sensitivity to conventional magnetometers. Our work introduces a cost-effective prototype for the next generation of magnetometry, and may advance scientific research and technologies that rely on ultrasensitive magnetic field detection.</description>

      <title>Massively parallel and universal approximation of nonlinear functions using diffractive processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear computation is essential for a wide range of information processing tasks, yet implementing nonlinear functions using optical systems remains a challenge due to the weak and power-intensive nature of optical nonlinearities. Overcoming this limitation without relying on nonlinear optical materials could unlock unprecedented opportunities for ultrafast and parallel optical computing systems. Here, we demonstrate that large-scale nonlinear computation can be performed using linear optics through optimized diffractive processors composed of passive phase-only surfaces. In this framework, the input variables of nonlinear functions are encoded into the phase of an optical wavefront, e.g., via a spatial light modulator (SLM), and transformed by an optimized diffractive structure with spatially varying point-spread functions to yield output intensities that approximate a large set of unique nonlinear functions, all in parallel. We provide proof establishing that this architecture serves as a universal function approximator for an arbitrary set of bandlimited nonlinear functions, also covering multi-variate and complex-valued functions. We also numerically demonstrate the parallel computation of one million distinct nonlinear functions, accurately executed at wavelength-scale spatial density at the output of a diffractive optical processor. Furthermore, we experimentally validated this framework using in situ optical learning and approximated 35 unique nonlinear functions in a single shot using a compact setup consisting of an SLM and an image sensor. These results establish diffractive optical processors as a scalable platform for massively parallel universal nonlinear function approximation, paving the way for new capabilities in analog optical computing based on linear materials.</description>

      <title>Electrothermally Modulated Nanophotonic Waveguide-integrated Ring Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable integrated chips of photonic components and networks are envisaged to play a key role in realizing highly efficient integrated photonic information processing. Electrothermally modulated optical effect (ETMOE) is a powerful thermo-optic tuning mechanism for silicon photonic devices, enabling precise optical control via localized Joule heating. We present a rigorous and three-dimensional electronic-photonic co-integrated approach with the nonlinear numerical coupling of temperature and wavelength-dependent material properties to comprehensively model ETMOE in silicon waveguides and resonators. A platinum-based symmetric heater is optimized using advanced true 3D numerical simulations, achieving efficient ETMOE-based tuning while mitigating asymmetric heat distribution. In addition to a complete design and analysis of the fully integrated three-dimensional switch, we also evaluate single-mode waveguide cutoff, heater-to-waveguide separation, heater dimensions, and thermal dissipation, providing a framework for ETMOE-based optimization. The findings contribute to energy-efficient, programmable photonic systems for neuromorphic computing, optical interconnects, and reconfigurable photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Refraction corrected specular beamforming applied to cortical bone enhances interface visibility of bone-soft tissues interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging of the cortex of long bones may enable the measurement of the cortical thickness and the ultrasound wave speed in cortical bone tissue. However, with bone loss, the cortical porosity and the size of the pores increase, resulting in strong ultrasound diffuse scattering whose magnitude can exceed that of the specular reflection from the bone-marrow (endosteal) interface. In this study we adapt to bone a specular beamforming technique proposed to better image a needle in soft tissue. Our approach takes into account both wave refraction and specular reflection physics to enhance the contrast of bone surfaces and reduce speckle from intracortical pores. In vivo ultrasound data were acquired at the center of the human tibia in a plane normal to the bone axis of 11 young healthy volunteeers. Ex vivo ultrasound data were acquired from 16 regions of interest from the femoral diaphysis of three elderly donors (donors 66-98 y.o.) using a 2.5 MHz US transducer. A single-element trans mission synthetic aperture imaging sequence was implemented on a research ultrasound system with a 2.5MHz phased array transducer. Image reconstruction was performed: (A) a delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm with optimized f-number, correction of refraction at the soft tissue-bone interface and subject-specific ultrasound wave speed and (B) an adaptive algorithm using Snells law of reflection. The improvement of image quality was evaluated with contrast ratios of the average intensities: CEI between the endosteal surface and the center of the cortex. In vivo, specular beamforming improved the visibility of the endosteum (CEI ) by 1 to 13 dB while maintaining the relative contrast between the outer and inner surfaces of the cortex. These results suggest that the visualization of the intra-osseous anatomy can be enhanced if Snells law and wave refraction are taken into account during image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Metamaterial two-sphere Newton's cradle</title>

Abstract: Locally resonant metamaterials are among the most studied types of elastic/acoustic metamaterials, with significant research focused on wave propagation in a continuum of "meta-atoms" Here we investigate the collision dynamics of two identical pendulum-suspended mass-in-mass resonators, essentially a two-sphere Newton's cradle, emphasizing the readily realizable scenario where the internal resonator frequency is much greater than the pendulum frequency. We first show that the dynamics of a collision can be described using effective parameters, similar to how previous metamaterials research has characterized wave propagation through effective material properties. Non-conventional collision dynamics -- observed in two colliding mass-in-mass systems where one is initially at rest -- include behaviors such as the moving sphere rebounding as if from a fixed wall while the other remains essentially stationary, the spheres coupling and moving forward in near-unison, and the spheres recoiling in opposite directions. These responses can be achieved by tuning the effective parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters can take on values that differ significantly from those in a conventional Newton's cradle. Additionally, we investigate multiple collisions of the two spheres, revealing complex dynamics. This work paves the way for the development and study of new "collision-based metamaterial" structures.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk-mitigated microelectronic control for optically-active spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To exploit the sub-nanometre dimensions of qubits for large-scale quantum information processing, corresponding control architectures require both energy and space efficiency, with the on-chip footprint of unit-cell electronics ideally micron-scale. However, the spin coherence of qubits in close packing is severely deteriorated by microwave crosstalk from neighbouring control sites. Here, we present a crosstalk-mitigation scheme using foundry microelectronics, to address solid-state spins at sub-100 $\mu$m spacing without the need for qubit-detuning. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in nanodiamonds as qubit prototypes, we first demonstrate 10 MHz Rabi oscillation at milliwatts of microwave power. Implementing the active cancellation, we then prove that the crosstalk field from neighbouring lattice sites can be reduced to undetectable levels. We finally extend the scheme to show increased qubit control, or effectively, the spin coherence under crosstalk mitigation. Compatible with integrated optics, our results present a step towards scalable control across quantum platforms using silicon microelectronics.</description>

      <title>Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, along with charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise, as diagnostic tools to distinguish Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana-bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR states arise from magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within a trivial s-wave superconducting gap, while MBS emerge in topological superconductors, often leading to ambiguity in experiments where magnetic impurities mimic zero-energy MBS signatures. By replacing the trivial superconductor with a topological one exhibiting triplet pairing (e.g., chiral p or spinless p-wave nanowires), we identify robust and distinguishing features of YSR and MBS states. Our analysis demonstrates that combined measurements of both charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, and their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts offer unique and reliable signatures to differentiate YSR states from genuine MBS, thereby reducing false-positive interpretations in topological superconductivity experiments.</description>

      <title>Design of thermal hysteresis in nonstoichiometric alloys with giant magnetocaloric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-stoichiometric Fe$_2$P-type (FeMnP$_{0.5}$Si$_{0.5}$)$_{1-x}$(FeV)$_{x}$ alloys ( $x=0, 0.01$, $0.02$, and $0.03$) have been investigated as potential candidates for magnetic refrigeration near room temperature. The magnetic ordering temperature decreases with increasing FeV concentration, $x$, which can be ascribed to decreased ferromagnetic coupling strength between the magnetic atoms. The strong magnetoelastic coupling in these alloys results in large values of the isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_M$); $15.7$ J/kgK, at $2$ T magnetic field for the $x = 0$ alloy. $\Delta S_M$ decreases with increasing $x$. Results from M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy reveal that the average hyperfine field (in the ferromagnetic state) and average center shift (in the paramagnetic state) have the same decreasing trend as $\Delta S_M$. The thermal hysteresis ($\Delta T_{hyst}$) of the magnetic phase transition decreases with increasing $x$, while the mechanical stability of the alloys improves due to the reduced lattice volume change across the magnetoelastic phase transition. The adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}$, which highly depends on $\Delta T_{hyst}$, is $1.7$ K at $1.9$ T applied field for the $x = 0.02$ alloy.</description>

      <title>Perspective of high-speed Mach-Zehnder modulators based on nonlinear optics and complex band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical modulators are essential building blocks for high-capacity optical communication and massively parallel computing. Among all types of optical modulators, travelling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulators (TW-MZMs) featuring high speed and efficiency are widely used, and have been developed on a variety of integrated material platforms. Existing methods to design and simulate TW-MZMs so far strongly rely on the peculiar material properties, and thus inevitably involve complicated electrical-circuit models. As a result, these methods diverge significantly. In addition, they become increasingly inefficient and inaccurate for TW-MZMs with extending length and levitating modulation speed, posing formidable challenges for millimeter-wave and terahertz operation. Here, we present an innovative perspective to understand and analyze high-speed TW-MZMs. Our perspective leverages nonlinear optics and complex band structures of RF photonic crystals, and is thus entirely electromagnetic-wave-based. Under this perspective, we showcase the design, optoelectronic simulation and experimental validation of high-speed TW-MZMs based on Si and LiNbO$_3$, and further demonstrate unambiguous advantages in simplicity, accuracy and efficiency over conventional methods. Our approach can essentially be applied to nearly any integrated material platform, including those based on semiconductors and electro-absorption materials. With high-frequency electrode designs and optoelectronic co-simulation, our approach facilitates the synergy and convergence of electronics and photonics, and offers a viable route to constructing future high-speed millimeter-wave and terahertz photonics and quantum systems.</description>
