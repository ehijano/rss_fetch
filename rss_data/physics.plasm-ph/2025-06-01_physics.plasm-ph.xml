      <title>Laser-driven ion acceleration in long-lived optically shaped gaseous targets enhanced by magnetic vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research demonstrates high-repetition-rate laser-accelerated ion beams via dual, intersecting, counterpropagating laser-driven blast waves to precisely shape underdense gas into long-lived near-critical density targets. The collision of the shock fronts compresses the gas and forms steep density gradients with scale lengths of a few tens of microns. The compressed target persists for several nanoseconds, eliminating laser synchronization constraints. Measurements of multi-MeV ion energy spectra are reported. 3D hydrodynamic simulations are used to optimize the density profile and assess the influence of the Amplified Spontaneous Emission of the femtosecond accelerating laser pulse. A synthetic optical probing model is applied to directly compare simulations with experimental data. 3D Particle-In-Cell simulations reveal the formation of multi-kT, azimuthal magnetic fields, indicating Magnetic Vortex Acceleration as the main acceleration mechanism.</description>

      <title>Resonance density range governs two-plasmon decay saturation and enables hot-electron prediction in inertial confinement fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The saturation level of parametric instabilities critically determines their impact on fusion plasmas. We identify the resonance density range of two-plasmon decay as the critical parameter governing nonlinear saturation of ion density fluctuations and Langmuir waves, which drive hot-electron generation. Using this insight, we develop a predictive scaling model for the hot-electron energy fraction f_{hot} that depends only on the laser intensity I, with plasma conditions encoded via plasma ablation theory. The model can work for various experimental configurations-requiring only two (I, f_{hot}) data points to calibrate coefficients-and successfully reproduces results from prior OMEGA and OMEGA-EP experiments.</description>

      <title>High-charge relativistic electrons by vacuum laser acceleration from plasma mirrors using flying focus pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic electron beams produced by intense lasers over short distances have important applications in high energy density physics and medical technologies. Vacuum laser acceleration with plasma mirrors injectors has garnered substantial research interest recently. However, a persistent challenge remains unresolved that electrons inevitably detach from the laser acceleration phase due to velocity mismatch. Here, we employ flying focus lasers to address this limitation. Through three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that flying focus lasers can achieve a substantial enhancement in relativistic electron charge yield compared to conventional Gaussian lasers. This improvement stems from two key attributes: (1) The subluminal propagation velocity of the peak intensity keeps a larger electron population synchronized within the longitudinal ponderomotive acceleration region, and (2) Flying focus lasers sustain higher magnitudes of the longitudinal ponderomotive force over longer distances in comparison to Gaussian lasers. This approach offers high-charge relativistic electron sources ideal for demanding applications such as high-flux Thomson scattering and radiography.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Hybrid Response of Photoionized Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoionized gases are prevalent throughout the universe. In such gases, the ion concentration typically exhibits two response modes to radiation: a positive response in the low-ionization state and a negative response in the high-ionization state. Here, we report the discovery of a widespread misalignment at the boundary between the above two response modes, and identify a third mode-the hybrid response-through time-dependent photoionization simulations. This phenomenon arises from the asynchrony among the ionization rate, recombination rate, and ion column density. Among these, only the ionization rate can respond instantaneously to changes in radiation. Consequently, the initial rate of change in the column density of \( N_i \) ion is given by \( -N_i I_i + N_{i-1} I_{i-1} \). However, this quantity is typically nonzero at the peak of \( N_i \), leading to a misalignment between the boundaries of positive and negative responses. Such hybrid effects introduce additional complexity in the interpretation of gas properties, highlighting the need for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Iion-motion simulations of a plasma-wakefield experiment at FLASHForward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In plasma-based acceleration, an ultra-relativistic particle bunch$\unicode{x2014}$or an intense laser beam$\unicode{x2014}$is used to expel electrons from its propagation path, forming a wake that is devoid of electrons. The ions, being significantly more massive, are often assumed to be stationary. However, both theory and simulations suggest that any sufficiently dense electron bunch can trigger ion motion, and its effect must be taken into account. We simulate beam-driven plasma wakefields to identify key features$\unicode{x2014}$such as longitudinally dependent emittance growth$\unicode{x2014}$that could be observed in an experiment using plasma and beam parameters from the FLASHForward facility at DESY.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of oscillatory magnetic reconnection modulated by solar convective motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory magnetic reconnection is a periodic magnetic reconnection process, during which the current sheet's orientation and the magnetic connections change periodically. This periodic variation is generally considered to originate from the magnetic reconnection itself rather than from external driving processes. We conduct 2.5-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the emergence of a magnetic flux tube from the convection zone into the lower corona, where the emerging magnetic fields reconnect with background ones. During the reconnection process within 5771 s, the current sheet's orientation has been reversed 41 times, corresponding to 40 oscillation periods. Notably, the longest period is 30 minutes, which is consistent with the previous observational results. We find that the main factor leading to the reversal of the current sheet's orientation is the quasi-periodic external force provided by the emergence of plasma and magnetic fields from the convection zone. We also find the shifting of the upward outflows from the reconnection region along the horizontal direction due to the alternating changes of the reconnection inflow and outflow regions. In addition to the quasi-periodic change of the current sheet orientation, the reconnection rate at the main X-point also oscillates with a period between 100-400 s, which corresponds to the period of p-mode oscillations.</description>

      <title>Novel methodology to obtain transonic solutions for dissipative flows around compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel methodology to obtain global transonic solutions around compact objects is reported here. A unified methodology to obtain accretion as well as wind solutions around these objects has been presented. Flows around compact objects are dissipative, and the conservation equations are therefore stiff. In such conditions, obtaining of sonic point(s) and hence, the transonic solution is not trivial. The conserved equations of motion fail to integrate in the presence of realistic viscosity, thereby making it difficult to obtain a global solution. This inhibits one from getting an actual picture of an astrophysical flow. The current work addresses this long-standing issue of obtaining solutions for both accretion and wind. The methodology developed utilises the inner boundary conditions and takes recourse to implicit-explicit (ImEx) integration schemes, to obtain general global transonic accretion and wind solutions. This is the first time such an attempt has been made. Current work considers the different cooling processes like bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and their inverse-Comptonizations, which are found to affect the thermodynamics of the flow. This methodology could successfully generate all topologies of global solutions, multiple sonic point regime, as well as shocks. A broad parameter space study has been done in this work. In an upcoming part II of the paper, a detailed discussion on the spectra and luminosity of the accretion and wind solutions has been presented.</description>

      <title>Electron Penetration Acceleration in Turbulent Magnetic Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using particle-in-cell simulations to study fast radio burst (FRB) propagation in a tenuous plasma, we identified a novel mechanism that occurs during the growth of turbulent magnetic loops: electron penetration acceleration. The loops have an electromagnetic left-hand chirality distinct from that of well-known quasistatic magnetic islands. The fast electrons penetrate through the loops and thus are accelerated to unexpected relativistic energies due to the symmetry breaking induced by the coupling between the loop field and the non-relativistic electromagnetic wave. The identified features of penetration acceleration and magnetic loops might provide a new perspective for understanding particle injection into relativistic collisionless shock precursors invoked in FRB-swept cosmic backgrounds. Additionally, we show that this FRB-relevant phenomenon could be tested in scaled laboratory experiments using a multi-terawatt laser impinging on gas targets.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Plasma-Based Compressor for Ultrafast Soft X-ray Free-Electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of intense, femtosecond-scale X-ray pulses is crucial for probing matter under extreme temporal and field conditions. Current chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) techniques in free-electron lasers (FELs), however, face efficiency limitations in the soft X-ray regime due to the inherent constraints of conventional optical compressors. To address this challenge, we propose a high-efficiency plasma-based compressor utilizing highly ionized noble gas plasma. Exploiting strong refractive index dispersion near ionic resonances, this scheme achieves over 70% transmission efficiency around 5.2 nm, and is extendable to other highly charged ions for operation across the soft X-ray to vacuum ultraviolet range. Simulations demonstrate that a 25 fs FEL pulse can be compressed to 1.4 fs with peak power boosted to over 100 GW, while maintaining high energy throughput. This approach overcomes the long-standing efficiency bottleneck of soft X-ray CPA and opens a scalable path toward compact, high-brightness attosecond FEL sources.</description>
