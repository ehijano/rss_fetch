      <title>Agent-Based Simulation of a Perpetual Futures Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce an agent-based model of a Perpetual Futures market with heterogeneous agents trading via a central limit order book. Perpetual Futures (henceforth Perps) are financial derivatives introduced by the economist Robert Shiller, designed to peg their price to that of the underlying Spot market. This paper extends the limit order book model of Chiarella et al. (2002) by taking their agent and orderbook parameters, designed for a simple stock exchange, and applying it to the more complex environment of a Perp market with long and short traders who exhibit both positional and basis-trading behaviors. I find that despite the simplicity of the agent behavior, the simulation is able to reproduce the most salient feature of a Perp market, the pegging of the Perp price to the underlying Spot price. In contrast to fundamental simulations of stock markets which aim to reproduce empirically observed stylized facts such as the leptokurtosis and heteroscedasticity of returns, volatility clustering and others, in derivatives markets many of these features are provided exogenously by the underlying Spot price signal. This is especially true of Perps since the derivative is designed to mimic the price of the Spot market. Therefore, this paper will focus exclusively on analyzing how market and agent parameters such as order lifetime, trading horizon and spread affect the premiums at which Perps trade with respect to the underlying Spot market. I show that this simulation provides a simple and robust environment for exploring the dynamics of Perpetual Futures markets and their microstructure in this regard. Lastly, I explore the ability of the model to reproduce the effects of biasing long traders to trade positionally and short traders to basis-trade, which was the original intention behind the market design, and is a tendency observed empirically in real Perp markets.</description>

      <title>Optimal Execution among $N$ Traders with Transient Price Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $N$-player optimal execution games in an Obizhaeva--Wang model of transient price impact. When the game is regularized by an instantaneous cost on the trading rate, a unique equilibrium exists and we derive its closed form. Whereas without regularization, there is no equilibrium. We prove that existence is restored if (and only if) a very particular, time-dependent cost on block trades is added to the model. In that case, the equilibrium is particularly tractable. We show that this equilibrium is the limit of the regularized equilibria as the instantaneous cost parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to zero. Moreover, we explain the seemingly ad-hoc block cost as the limit of the equilibrium instantaneous costs. Notably, in contrast to the single-player problem, the optimal instantaneous costs do not vanish in the limit $\varepsilon\to0$. We use this tractable equilibrium to study the cost of liquidating in the presence of predators and the cost of anarchy. Our results also give a new interpretation to the erratic behaviors previously observed in discrete-time trading games with transient price impact.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Routing in Mixture of Experts: A Novel Framework for Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the deployment of the mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism in the stock investment domain. While these models have demonstrated promising trading performance, they are often unimodal, neglecting the wealth of information available in other modalities, such as textual data. Moreover, the traditional neural network-based router selection mechanism fails to consider contextual and real-world nuances, resulting in suboptimal expert selection. To address these limitations, we propose LLMoE, a novel framework that employs LLMs as the router within the MoE architecture. Specifically, we replace the conventional neural network-based router with LLMs, leveraging their extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities to select experts based on historical price data and stock news. This approach provides a more effective and interpretable selection mechanism. Our experiments on multimodal real-world stock datasets demonstrate that LLMoE outperforms state-of-the-art MoE models and other deep neural network approaches. Additionally, the flexible architecture of LLMoE allows for easy adaptation to various downstream tasks.</description>
