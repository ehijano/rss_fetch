      <title>Generative Super-Resolution PET Imaging with Fourier Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurological Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a critical imaging modality for diagnosing and studying neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. However, the inherent low spatial resolution of PET images poses significant challenges in clinical settings. This work introduces a novel Generative Super-Resolution (GSR) approach using Fourier Diffusion Models (FDMs) to enhance the spatial resolution of PET images. Unlike traditional methods, FDMs leverage the time-dependent Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) to generate high-resolution, low-noise images from low-resolution inputs. Our method was evaluated using simulated data derived from High-Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) PET images with 2 mm resolution. The results demonstrate that FDMs significantly outperform existing techniques, including conditional diffusion models and image-to-image Schr\"odinger bridge, across several metrics, including structural similarity and noise suppression. Our simulation results highlight the potential of FDMs to generate high-quality 2mm resolution reconstructions given 4mm resolution input PET data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Static CT with Adaptive Fluence Modulation to Minimize Hallucinations in Generative Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-source static Computed Tomography (CT) systems have introduced novel opportunities for adaptive imaging techniques. This work presents an innovative method of fluence field modulation using spotlight collimators. These instruments block positive or negative fan angles of even and odd indexed sources, respectively. Spotlight collimators enable volume of interest imaging by increasing relative exposure for the overlapping views. To achieve high quality reconstructions from sparse-view low-dose data, we introduce a generative reconstruction algorithm called Langevin Posterior Sampling (LPS), which uses a score based diffusion prior and physics based likelihood model to sample a posterior random walk. We conduct simulation-based experiments of head CT imaging for stroke detection and we demonstrate that spotlight collimators can effectively reduce the standard deviation and worst-case scenario hallucinations in reconstructed images. Compared to uniform fluence, our approach shows a significant reduction in posterior standard deviation. This highlights the potential for spotlight collimators and generative reconstructions to improve image quality and diagnostic accuracy of multi-source static CT.</description>

      <title>Pseudoinverse Diffusion Models for Generative CT Image Reconstruction from Low Dose Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have significantly advanced generative deep learning for image processing. Measurement conditioned models have also been applied to inverse problems such as CT reconstruction. However, the conventional approach, culminating in white noise, often requires a high number of reverse process update steps and score function evaluations. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative forward process in score-based diffusion models that aligns with the noise characteristics of low-dose CT reconstructions, rather than converging to white noise. This method significantly reduces the number of required score function evaluations, enhancing efficiency and maintaining familiar noise textures for radiologists, Our approach not only accelerates the generative process but also retains CT noise correlations, a key aspect often criticized by clinicians for deep learning reconstructions. In this work, we rigorously define a matrix-controlled stochastic process for this purpose and validate it through computational experiments. Using a dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC), we simulate low-dose CT measurements and train our model, comparing it with a baseline scalar diffusion process and conditional diffusion model. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our pseudoinverse diffusion model in terms of efficiency and the ability to produce high-quality reconstructions that are familiar in texture to medical professionals in a low number of score function evaluations. This advancement paves the way for more efficient and clinically practical diffusion models in medical imaging, particularly beneficial in scenarios demanding rapid reconstructions or lower radiation exposure.</description>

      <title>Key Body Posture Characteristics of Short-distance Speed Skaters at the Start Based on Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective To conduct biomechanical analysis on the starting technique of male short-distance speed skating athletes in China and determine the key factors affecting the effectiveness of the starting movement. Methods 13 high-level male short-distance speed skating athletes were selected as the test subjects, and kinematic data were collected using an artificial intelligence video capture and analysis system. The body posture features and their effects on the starting movement performance were analyzed in the three stages of starting preparation, starting, and sprinting. Results The post-stability angle, anterior knee angle of the front leg, posterior knee angle of the rear leg, and stride length showed moderate to high positive correlations with the starting speed during the starting preparation stage. The trunk angle showed a high negative correlation with the starting speed. The trunk angle (TO4, TD4, TO6, TD6), hip angle (TO1, TO4, TO6), and knee angle (TD1) showed moderate to high negative correlations with the effectiveness of the starting movement during the starting and sprinting stages. The knee angle (TD2), ice-contact angle (TD2, TD4, TD5, TD6), and propulsion angle (TO1, TO4, TO7) showed moderate positive correlations with the effectiveness of the starting movement. Conclusion Stride length, left knee angle, and post-stability angle are the key factors affecting the starting speed. The larger the post-stability angle and left knee angle and the longer the stride length, the faster the starting speed. During the starting and sprinting stages, the smaller the ice-contact angle and propulsion angle, the greater the trunk angle and hip angle changes, the more effective the starting movement.</description>

      <title>A biomechanical comparison of concussion and head acceleration events in elite-level American football and rugby union</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elite-level American football and rugby union are two high-contact sports with growing clinical and legal concerns over player safety, necessitating a comparative analysis. A biomechanical comparison of concussion and head acceleration events (HAEs) in elite-level American football and rugby union was undertaken. Rugby union players have a greater number of professional playing years and matches available in a season than their American football counterparts. Rugby union players have a greater number of concussions reported per match and a higher proportion of concussions occurring during training sessions, based on National Football League (NFL) and Rugby Football Union (RFU) injury reports. Preliminary findings indicate that rugby union forwards experience a higher incidence of HAEs per player match over lower and higher magnitude thresholds, than American football defensive players. Overall, elite-level rugby union appears less favourable than American football in in almost all metrics pertinent to concussion and HAE exposure in the biomechanical comparison undertaken. The findings highlight the critical importance of independence, scientific rigour, and transparency in future concussion and HAE biomechanics research and real-world implementation, ensuring the development of more effective mitigation strategies.</description>
