      <title>Unsupervised Blind Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR.

      <title>Differentiating Emigration from Return Migration of Scholars Using Name-Based Nationality Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most web and digital trace data do not include information about an individual's nationality due to privacy concerns. The lack of data on nationality can create challenges for migration research. It can lead to a left-censoring issue since we are uncertain about the migrant's country of origin. Once we observe an emigration event, if we know the nationality, we can differentiate it from return migration. We propose methods to detect the nationality with the least available data, i.e., full names. We use the detected nationality in comparison with the country of academic origin, which is a common approach in studying the migration of researchers. We gathered 2.6 million unique name-nationality pairs from Wikipedia and categorized them into families of nationalities with three granularity levels to use as our training data. Using a character-based machine learning model, we achieved a weighted F1 score of 84% for the broadest and 67% for the most granular, country-level categorization. In our empirical study, we used the trained and tested model to assign nationality to 8+ million scholars' full names in Scopus data. Our results show that using the country of first publication as a proxy for nationality underestimates the size of return flows, especially for countries with a more diverse academic workforce, such as the USA, Australia, and Canada. We found that around 48% of emigration from the USA was return migration once we used the country of name origin, in contrast to 33% based on academic origin. In the most recent period, 79% of scholars whose affiliation has consistently changed from the USA to China, and are considered emigrants, have Chinese names in contrast to 41% with a Chinese academic origin. Our proposed methods for addressing left-censoring issues are beneficial for other research that uses digital trace data to study migration.</description>

      <title>Can Prompting LLMs Unlock Hate Speech Detection across Languages? A Zero-shot and Few-shot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting techniques to maximize performance.</description>

      <title>Detecting Multimedia Generated by Large AI Models: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00045v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large AI Models (LAIMs), particularly diffusion models and large language models, has marked a new era where AI-generated multimedia is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life. Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns. Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos, audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability, robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact. Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure the integrity of information in the digital realm.

      <title>Visual and Auditory Aesthetic Preferences Across Cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on how humans perceive aesthetics in shapes, colours, and music has predominantly focused on Western populations, limiting our understanding of how cultural environments shape aesthetic preferences. We present a large-scale cross-cultural study examining aesthetic preferences across five distinct modalities extensively explored in the literature: shape, curvature, colour, musical harmony and melody. We gather 401,403 preference judgements from 4,835 participants across 10 countries, systematically sampling two-dimensional parameter spaces for each modality. The findings reveal both universal patterns and cultural variations. Preferences for shape and curvature cross-culturally demonstrate a consistent preference for symmetrical forms. While colour preferences are categorically consistent, ratio-like preferences vary across cultures. Musical harmony shows strong agreement in interval relationships despite differing regions of preference within the broad frequency spectrum, while melody shows the highest cross-cultural variation. These results suggest that aesthetic preferences emerge from an interplay between shared perceptual mechanisms and cultural learning.</description>

      <title>A vector quantized masked autoencoder for audiovisual speech emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important challenge in emotion recognition is to develop methods that can leverage unlabeled training data. In this paper, we propose the VQ-MAE-AV model, a self-supervised multimodal model that leverages masked autoencoders to learn representations of audiovisual speech without labels. The model includes vector quantized variational autoencoders that compress raw audio and visual speech data into discrete tokens. The audiovisual speech tokens are used to train a multimodal masked autoencoder that consists of an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms. The model is designed to extract both local (i.e., at the frame level) and global (i.e., at the sequence level) representations of audiovisual speech. During self-supervised pre-training, the VQ-MAE-AV model is trained on a large-scale unlabeled dataset of audiovisual speech, for the task of reconstructing randomly masked audiovisual speech tokens and with a contrastive learning strategy. During this pre-training, the encoder learns to extract a representation of audiovisual speech that can be subsequently leveraged for emotion recognition. During the supervised fine-tuning stage, a small classification model is trained on top of the VQ-MAE-AV encoder for an emotion recognition task. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art emotion recognition results across several datasets in both controlled and in-the-wild conditions.</description>

      <title>Persistence of Backdoor-based Watermarks for Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained considerable traction in recent years due to the unparalleled results they gathered. However, the cost behind training such sophisticated models is resource intensive, resulting in many to consider DNNs to be intellectual property (IP) to model owners. In this era of cloud computing, high-performance DNNs are often deployed all over the internet so that people can access them publicly. As such, DNN watermarking schemes, especially backdoor-based watermarks, have been actively developed in recent years to preserve proprietary rights. Nonetheless, there lies much uncertainty on the robustness of existing backdoor watermark schemes, towards both adversarial attacks and unintended means such as fine-tuning neural network models. One reason for this is that no complete guarantee of robustness can be assured in the context of backdoor-based watermark. In this paper, we extensively evaluate the persistence of recent backdoor-based watermarks within neural networks in the scenario of fine-tuning, we propose/develop a novel data-driven idea to restore watermark after fine-tuning without exposing the trigger set. Our empirical results show that by solely introducing training data after fine-tuning, the watermark can be restored if model parameters do not shift dramatically during fine-tuning. Depending on the types of trigger samples used, trigger accuracy can be reinstated to up to 100%. Our study further explores how the restoration process works using loss landscape visualization, as well as the idea of introducing training data in fine-tuning stage to alleviate watermark vanishing.</description>

      <title>Marker-Based Extrinsic Calibration Method for Accurate Multi-Camera 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction using multi-camera RGB-D systems critically depends on precise extrinsic calibration to achieve proper alignment between captured views. In this paper, we introduce an iterative extrinsic calibration method that leverages the geometric constraints provided by a three-dimensional marker to significantly improve calibration accuracy. Our proposed approach systematically segments and refines marker planes through clustering, regression analysis, and iterative reassignment techniques, ensuring robust geometric correspondence across camera views. We validate our method comprehensively in both controlled environments and practical real-world settings within the Tech4Diet project, aimed at modeling the physical progression of patients undergoing nutritional treatments. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in alignment errors, facilitating accurate and reliable 3D reconstructions.</description>
