      <title>Normalized Derivations for Milnor's Primitive Operations on the Dickson Algebra and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work investigates the action of primitive Milnor operations $St^{\Delta_i}$ on the Dickson algebra $D_n$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$, building upon a foundational formula by Nguyen Sum [3]. Our central contribution is the introduction of a normalized operator, $\delta_i$, by factoring out the ubiquitous invariant $Q_{n, 0}$. This normalization transforms $St^{\Delta_i}$ into a true derivation on the localized Dickson algebra, thereby establishing an elegant differential framework. This framework yields two new significant results: first, a closed-form formula for all higher iterates of the operator, revealing a strong factorial-based vanishing criterion for iterates of order $\geq p$. Second, the discovery of a normalized coordinate system where the action has constant coefficients. This latter insight reduces the problem of computing the associated Margolis homology to a standard Koszul complex computation, in direct analogy with a recent result by Ngo Anh Tuan [4]. As further consequences, we also construct a large family of kernel elements and describe the global structure of the action.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the computed homology and cohomology bases -- technical report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing homology and cohomology is at the heart of many recent works and a key issue for topological data analysis. Among homological objects, homology generators are useful to locate or understand holes (especially for geometric objects). The present paper provides a characterization of the class of homology bases that are computed by standard algorithmic methods. The proof of this characterization relies on the Homological Discrete Vector Field, a combinatorial structure for computing homology, which encompasses several standard methods (persistent homology, tri-partitions, Smith Normal Form, discrete Morse theory). These results refine the combinatorial homology theory and provide novel ideas to gain more control over the computation of homology generators.</description>

      <title>The Negation Of Singer's Conjecture For The Sixth Algebraic Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6, 6+36).$</description>

      <title>Rigidifying simplicial complexes and realizing group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any action of a finite group on a finitely presentable group arises as the action of the group of self-homotopy equivalences of a space on its fundamental group. In doing so, we prove that any finite connected (abstract) simplicial complex $\mathbf{K}$ can be rigidified -- meaning it can be perturbed in a way that reduces the full automorphism group to any subgroup -- while preserving the homotopy type of the geometric realization $| \mathbf{K} |$.</description>

      <title>Core Bifiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01214v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation of this paper is to recognize a geometric shape from a noisy sample in the form of a point cloud. Inspired by the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, we introduce the core dissimilarity, from which we construct the core bifiltration. We also consider the Delaunay core bifiltration by intersecting with Voronoi cells, giving us a filtered simplicial complex of smaller size. A major advantage of the (Delaunay) core bifiltration is that, for each filtration value, it admits a good cover of balls. By the persistent nerve theorem, the nerve of this cover is homotopy equivalent to the (Delaunay) core bifiltration. We show that the multicover-, core- and Delaunay core bifiltrations are all interleaved, and that they enjoy similar stability properties with respect to the Prohorov distance. We have performed experiments with the Delaunay core bifiltration. In the experiments, we calculated persistent homology along lines in the two-dimensional persistence parameter space, as well as multipersistence module approximations and Hilbert functions for the full Delaunay core bifiltration.</description>

      <title>On the third and fourth Betti numbers of a homogeneous space of a Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper "The second cohomology of nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras, Kyoto J. Math. 60 (2020), no. 2, 717-799" by I. Biswas, P. Chatterjee, and C. Maity, explicit descriptions of the second and first real de Rham cohomology groups of a general homogeneous space of a Lie group are given, extending an earlier result in "On the exactness of Kostant-Kirillov form and the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits, Internat. J. Math. 23 (2012), no. 8, 1250086" by I. Biswas and P. Chatterjee. From the computational viewpoint, they turned out to be new and very useful, and in fact played a crucial role in determining the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits as done in the above two papers. In this paper, we give computable and explicit descriptions of the third and fourth real de Rham cohomologies of a general homogeneous space, in terms of the associated Lie-theoretic data, along the lines mentioned above. We also draw numerous corollaries of our main results in important special settings. Moreover, as a consequence, we obtain a new and interesting invariant by showing that for a large class of homogeneous spaces, the difference between the third and fourth Betti numbers coincides with the difference between the numbers of simple factors of the ambient group and the associated closed subgroup.</description>

      <title>Some Observations on projective Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we compute the upper characteristic rank of the projective Stiefel manifolds over $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{H}$ and the flip Stiefel manifolds. We also provide bounds for the $\mathrm{cup}$ lengths of these spaces. We also provide necessary conditions for the existence of $S^3$-map between quaternionic Stiefel manifolds using the Fadell-Husseini index.</description>
