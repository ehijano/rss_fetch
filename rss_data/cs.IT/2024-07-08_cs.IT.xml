      <title>Negative Shaping Order K in Set Shaping Theory: A Comprehensive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into an innovative aspect of the Set Shaping Theory, exploring the use of a negative shaping order K. Traditionally, the theory utilizes a positive K to extend the length of data strings, enhancing their testability and compressibility. We propose a paradigm shift by employing a negative K, which shortens data strings and potentially improves compression efficiency. However, this approach sacrifices the local testability of the data, a cornerstone in traditional Set Shaping Theory. We examine the theoretical implications, practical benefits, and challenges of this new methodology.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Perturbation Enhanced SCL Decoder for Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For polar codes, successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithm significantly improves finite-length performance compared to SC decoding. SCL-flip decoding can further enhance the performance but the gain diminishes as code length increases, due to the difficulty in locating the first error bit position. In this work, we introduce an SCL-perturbation decoding algorithm to address this issue. A basic version of the algorithm introduces small random perturbations to the received symbols before each SCL decoding attempt, and exhibits non-diminishing gain at large block lengths. Its enhanced version adaptively performs random perturbations or directional perturbation on each received symbol according to previous decoding results, and managed to correct more errors with fewer decoding attempts. Extensive simulation results demonstrate stable gains across various code rates, lengths and list sizes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SCL enhancement with non-diminishing gains as code length increases, and achieves unprecedented efficiency. With only one additional SCL-$L$ decoding attempt (in total two), the proposed algorithm achieves SCL-$2L$-equivalent performance. Since the gain is obtained without increasing list size, the algorithm is best suited for hardware implementation.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Wireless Sensing and Communication: Applications and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of wireless communication technologies has precipitated an unprecedented demand for high data rates, extremely low latency, and ubiquitous connectivity. In order to achieve these goals, stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) has been developed as a novel solution to perform advanced signal processing tasks directly in the electromagnetic wave domain, thus achieving ultra-fast computing speed and reducing hardware complexity. This article provides an overview of the SIM technology by discussing its hardware architectures, advantages, and potential applications for wireless sensing and communication. Specifically, we explore the utilization of SIMs in enabling wave-domain beamforming, channel modeling and estimation in SIM-assisted communication systems. Furthermore, we elaborate on the potential of utilizing a SIM to build a hybrid optical-electronic neural network (HOENN) and demonstrate its efficacy by examining two case studies: disaster monitoring and direction-of-arrival estimation. Finally, we identify key implementation challenges, including practical hardware imperfections, efficient SIM configuration for realizing wave-domain signal processing, and performance analysis to motivate future research on this important and far-reaching topic.</description>

      <title>Decoding Analog Subspace Codes: Algorithms for Character-Polynomial Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose efficient minimum-distance decoding and list-decoding algorithms for a certain class of analog subspace codes, referred to as character-polynomial (CP) codes, recently introduced by Soleymani and the second author. In particular, a CP code without its character can be viewed as a subcode of a Reed--Solomon (RS) code, where a certain subset of the coefficients of the message polynomial is set to zeros. We then demonstrate how classical decoding methods, including list decoders, for RS codes can be leveraged for decoding CP codes. For instance, it is shown that, in almost all cases, the list decoder behaves as a unique decoder. We also present a probabilistic analysis of the improvements in list decoding of CP codes when leveraging their certain structure as subcodes of RS codes.</description>

      <title>A Unified Expression for Upper Bounds on the BLER of Spinal Codes over Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance evaluation of particular channel coding has been a significant topic in coding theory, often involving the use of bounding techniques. This paper focuses on the new family of capacity-achieving codes, Spinal codes, to provide a comprehensive analysis framework to tightly upper bound the block error rate (BLER) of Spinal codes in the finite block length (FBL) regime. First, we resort to a variant of the Gallager random coding bound to upper bound the BLER of Spinal codes over the fading channel. Then, this paper derives a new bound without resorting to the use of Gallager random coding bound, achieving provable tightness over the wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The derived BLER upper bounds in this paper are generalized, facilitating the performance evaluations of Spinal codes over different types of fast fading channels. Over the Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, and Rician fading channels, this paper explicitly derived the BLER upper bounds on Spinal codes as case studies. Based on the bounds, we theoretically reveal that the tail transmission pattern (TTP) for ML-decoded Spinal codes remains optimal in terms of reliability performance. Simulations verify the tightness of the bounds and the insights obtained.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Probabilistic Semantic Communication over Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) are emerging as a pivotal element in the evolution of future wireless networks. Despite their potential, the joint design of communication and computation within SAGINs remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, the problem of energy efficiency in SAGIN-enabled probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) system is investigated. In the considered model, a satellite needs to transmit data to multiple ground terminals (GTs) via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acting as a relay. During transmission, the satellite and the UAV can use PSC technique to compress the transmitting data, while the GTs can automatically recover the missing information. The PSC is underpinned by shared probability graphs that serve as a common knowledge base among the transceivers, allowing for resource-saving communication at the expense of increased computation resource. Through analysis, the computation overhead function in PSC is a piecewise function with respect to the semantic compression ratio. Therefore, it is important to make a balance between communication and computation to achieve optimal energy efficiency. The joint communication and computation problem is formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the total communication and computation energy consumption of the network under latency, power, computation capacity, bandwidth, semantic compression ratio, and UAV location constraints. To solve this non-convex non-smooth problem, we propose an iterative algorithm where the closed-form solutions for computation capacity allocation and UAV altitude are obtained at each iteration. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Impact of Channel Aging and Electromagnetic Interference on RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of channel aging and electromagnetic interference (EMI) on spatially correlated reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To effectively handle channel aging and EMI, we employ a novel two-phase channel estimation scheme with fractional power control-aided pilot assignment during the uplink channel estimation phase. This scheme provides improved channel estimates compared to existing approaches. The closed-form uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expressions incorporating fractional power control are derived to enable system performance evaluation. Additionally, we introduce the system's power consumption model to analyze energy efficiency (EE). Our numerical results illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the system performance with channel aging and EMI. Specifically, the proposed two-phase channel estimation scheme enhances estimation accuracy, compensating for performance degradation caused by channel aging and EMI. We find that increasing the number of access points (APs), RISs, antennas per AP, and elements per RIS can help to mitigate the SE performance degradation. We also find that an optimal number of APs can be selected to achieve energy efficiency (EE) maximization. However, in severe EMI environments, the benefits of deploying more RISs cannot be fully realized.</description>

      <title>Risk Bounds on MDL Estimators for Linear Regression Models with Application to Simple ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the theoretical foundations of deep learning from the viewpoint of the minimum description length (MDL) principle, we analyse risk bounds of MDL estimators based on two-stage codes for simple two-layers neural networks (NNs) with ReLU activation. For that purpose, we propose a method to design two-stage codes for linear regression models and establish an upper bound on the risk of the corresponding MDL estimators based on the theory on MDL estimators originated by Barron and Cover (1991). Then, we apply this result to the simple two-layers NNs with ReLU activation which consist of $d$ nodes in the input layer, $m$ nodes in the hidden layer and one output node. Since the object of estimation is only the $m$ weights from the hidden layer to the output node in our setting, this is an example of linear regression models. As a result, we show that the redundancy of the obtained two-stage codes is small owing to the fact that the eigenvalue distribution of the Fisher information matrix of the NNs is strongly biased, which was recently shown by Takeishi et al. (2023). That is, we establish a tight upper bound on the risk of our MDL estimators. Note that our risk bound, of which the leading term is $O(d^2 \log n /n)$, is independent of the number of parameters $m$.</description>

      <title>Overflow-Avoiding Memory AMP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) type algorithms are widely used for signal recovery in high-dimensional noisy linear systems. Recently, a principle called Memory AMP (MAMP) was proposed. Leveraging this principle, the gradient descent MAMP (GD-MAMP) algorithm was designed, inheriting the strengths of AMP and OAMP/VAMP. In this paper, we first provide an overflow-avoiding GD-MAMP (OA-GD-MAMP) to address the overflow problem that arises from some intermediate variables exceeding the range of floating point numbers. Second, we develop a complexity-reduced GD-MAMP (CR-GD-MAMP) to reduce the number of matrix-vector products per iteration by 1/3 (from 3 to 2) with little to no impact on the convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Hybrid NOMA Assisted OFDMA Uplink Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has recently received significant research interest due to its ability to efficiently use resources from different domains and also its compatibility with various orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based legacy networks. Unlike existing studies on hybrid NOMA that focus on combining NOMA with time-division multiple access (TDMA), this work considers hybrid NOMA assisted orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). In particular, the impact of a unique feature of hybrid NOMA assisted OFDMA, i.e., the availability of users' dynamic channel state information, on the system performance is analyzed from the following two perspectives. From the optimization perspective, analytical results are developed which show that with hybrid NOMA assisted OFDMA, the pure OMA mode is rarely adopted by the users, and the pure NOMA mode could be optimal for minimizing the users' energy consumption, which differs from the hybrid TDMA case. From the statistical perspective, two new performance metrics, namely the power outage probability and the power diversity gain, are developed to quantitatively measure the performance gain of hybrid NOMA over OMA. The developed analytical results also demonstrate the ability of hybrid NOMA to meet the users' diverse energy profiles.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the fundamental performance limits of integrated sensing and communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as a key enabler and feature of future wireless networks. In the existing works analyzing the performances of ISAC, discrete-time systems were commonly assumed, which, however, overlooked the impacts of temporal, spectral, and spatial properties. To address this issue, we establish a unified information model for the band-limited continuous-time ISAC systems. In the established information model, we employ a novel sensing performance metric, called the sensing mutual information (SMI). Through analysis, we show how the SMI can be utilized as a bridge between the mutual information domain and the mean squared error (MSE) domain. In addition, we illustrate the communication mutual information (CMI)-SMI and CMI-MSE regions to identify the performance bounds of ISAC systems in practical settings and reveal the trade-off between communication and sensing performances. Moreover, via analysis and numerical results, we provide two valuable insights into the design of novel ISAC-enabled systems: i) communication prefers the waveforms of random amplitude, sensing prefers the waveforms of constant amplitude, both communication and sensing favor the waveforms of low correlations with random phases; ii) There exists a linear positive proportional relationship between the allocated time-frequency resource and the achieved communication rate/sensing MSE.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Optimization of RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO NOMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where each access point (AP) serves all the users with the aid of the RIS. We practically model the system by considering imperfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and employing imperfect successive interference cancellation at the users end. We first obtain the channel estimates using linear minimum mean square error approach considering the spatial correlation at the RIS and then derive a closed-form downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expression using the statistical CSI. We next formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the sum SE of the system. We first introduce a novel successive Quadratic Transform (successive-QT) algorithm to optimize the transmit power coefficients using the concept of block optimization along with quadratic transform and then use the particle swarm optimization technique to design the RIS phase shifts. Note that most of the existing works on RIS-aided cell-free systems are specific instances of the general scenario studied in this work. We numerically show that i) the RIS-assisted link is more advantageous at lower transmit power regions where the direct link between AP and user is weak, ii) NOMA outperforms orthogonal multiple access schemes in terms of SE, and iii) the proposed joint optimization framework significantly improves the sum SE of the system.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to construct optimal quaternary additive codes with non-integer dimensions. Firstly, we propose combinatorial constructions of quaternary additive constant-weight codes, alongside additive anticode construction. Subsequently, we propose generalized Construction X, which facilitates the construction of non-integer dimensional optimal additive codes from linear codes. Then, we construct ten classes of optimal quaternary non-integer dimensional additive codes through these two methods. As an application, we also determine the optimal additive $[n,3.5,n-t]_4$ codes for all $t$ with variable $n$, except for $t=6,7,12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inequality measures provide a valuable tool for the analysis, comparison, and optimization based on system models. This work studies the relation between attributes or features of an individual to understand how redundant, unique, and synergetic interactions between attributes construct inequality. For this purpose, we define a family of inequality measures (f-inequality) from f-divergences. Special cases of this family are, among others, the Pietra index and the Generalized Entropy index. We present a decomposition for any f-inequality with intuitive set-theoretic behavior that enables studying the dynamics between attributes. Moreover, we use the Atkinson index as an example to demonstrate how the decomposition can be transformed to measures beyond f-inequality. The presented decomposition provides practical insights for system analyses and complements subgroup decompositions. Additionally, the results present an interesting interpretation of Shapley values and demonstrate the close relation between decomposing measures of inequality and information.</description>

      <title>Converse Techniques for Identification via Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in models that extend beyond Shannon's classical transmission scheme, renowned for its channel capacity formula $C$. One such promising direction is message identification via channels, introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. Unlike in Shannon's classical model, where the receiver aims to determine which message was sent from a set of $M$ messages, message identification focuses solely on discerning whether a specific message $m$ was transmitted. The encoder can operate deterministically or through randomization, with substantial advantages observed particularly in the latter approach. While Shannon's model allows transmission of $M = 2^{nC}$ messages, Ahlswede and Dueck's model facilitates the identification of $M = 2^{2^{nC}}$ messages, exhibiting a double exponential growth in block length. In their seminal paper, Ahlswede and Dueck established the achievability and introduced a "soft" converse bound. Subsequent works have further refined this, culminating in a strong converse bound, applicable under specific conditions. Watanabe's contributions have notably enhanced the applicability of the converse bound. The aim of this survey is multifaceted: to grasp the formalism and proof techniques outlined in the aforementioned works, analyze Watanabe's converse, trace the evolution from earlier converses to Watanabe's, emphasizing key similarities and differences that underpin the enhancements. Furthermore, we explore the converse proof for message identification with feedback, also pioneered by Ahlswede and Dueck. By elucidating how their approaches were inspired by preceding proofs, we provide a comprehensive overview. This overview paper seeks to offer readers insights into diverse converse techniques for message identification, with a focal point on the seminal works of Hayashi, Watanabe, and, in the context of feedback, Ahlswede and Dueck.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses the open question of implementing fault-tolerant QRLCs with feasible computational overhead. We present a new decoder for quantum random linear codes (QRLCs) capable of dealing with imperfect decoding operations. A first approach, introduced by Cruz et al., only considered channel errors, and perfect gates at the decoder. Here, we analyze the fault-tolerant characteristics of QRLCs with a new noise-guessing decoding technique, when considering preparation, measurement, and gate errors in the syndrome extraction procedure, while also accounting for error degeneracy. Our findings indicate a threshold error rate ($\pth$) of approximately $\pnum$ in the asymptotic limit, while considering realistic noise levels in the mentioned physical procedures.</description>

      <title>Logical Operators and Fold-Transversal Gates of Bivariate Bicycle Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes offer a promising route to scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation with constant overhead. Recent advancements have shown that qLDPC codes can outperform the quantum memory capability of surface codes even with near-term hardware. The question of how to implement logical gates fault-tolerantly for these codes is still open. We present new examples of high-rate bivariate bicycle (BB) codes with enhanced symmetry properties. These codes feature explicit nice bases of logical operators (similar to toric codes) and support fold-transversal Clifford gates without overhead. As examples, we construct $[[98,6,12]]$ and $[[162, 8, 12]]$ BB codes which admit interesting fault-tolerant Clifford gates. Our work also lays the mathematical foundations for explicit bases of logical operators and fold-transversal gates in quantum two-block and group algebra codes, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>List Privacy Under Function Recoverability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given function of user data, a querier must recover with at least a prescribed probability, the value of the function based on a user-provided query response. Subject to this requirement, the user forms the query response so as to minimize the likelihood of the querier guessing a list of prescribed size to which the data value belongs based on the query response. We obtain a general converse upper bound for maximum list privacy. This bound is shown to be tight for the case of a binary-valued function through an explicit achievability scheme that involves an add-noise query response.</description>

      <title>A Gr\"obner Approach to Dual-Containing Cyclic Left Module $(\theta,\delta)$-Codes over Finite Commutative Frobenius Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a skew polynomial ring $R=A[X;\theta,\delta]$ where $A$ is a commutative Frobenius ring, $\theta$ an endomorphism of $A$ and $\delta$ a $\theta$-derivation of $A$, we consider cyclic left module codes $\mathcal{C}=Rg/Rf\subset R/Rf$ where $g$ is a left and right divisor of $f$ in $R$. In this paper, we derive a parity check matrix when $A$ is a finite commutative Frobenius ring using only the framework of skew polynomial rings. We consider rings $A=B[a_1,\ldots,a_s]$ which are free $B$-modules where the restriction of $\delta$ and $\theta$ to $B$ are polynomial maps. If a Gr\"obner basis can be computed over $B$, then we show that all Euclidean and Hermitian dual-containing codes $\mathcal{C}=Rg/Rf\subset R/Rf$ can be computed using a Gr\"obner basis. We also give an algorithm to test if the dual code is again a cyclic left module code. We illustrate our approach for rings of order $4$ with non-trivial endomorphism and the Galois ring of characteristic $4$.</description>

      <title>Joint Fronthaul Load Balancing and Computation Resource Allocation in Cell-Free User-Centric Massive MIMO Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider scalable cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks under an open radio access network paradigm comprising user equipments (UEs), radio units (RUs), and decentralized processing units (DUs). UEs are served by dynamically allocated user-centric clusters of RUs. The corresponding cluster processors (implementing the physical layer for each user) are hosted by the DUs as software-defined virtual network functions. Unlike the current literature, mainly focused on the characterization of the user rates under unrestricted fronthaul communication and computation, in this work we explicitly take into account the fronthaul topology, the limited fronthaul communication capacity, and computation constraints at the DUs. In particular, we systematically address the new problem of joint fronthaul load balancing and allocation of the computation resource. As a consequence of our new optimization framework, we present representative numerical results highlighting the existence of an optimal number of quantization bits in the analog-to-digital conversion at the RUs.</description>

      <title>Joint Angle and Delay Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound Optimization for ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) beamforming design in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which an ISAC base station (BS) is used to communicate with multiple downlink users and simultaneously the communication signals are reused for sensing multiple targets. Our interested sensing parameters are the angle and delay information of the targets, which can be used to locate these targets. Under this consideration, we first derive the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for joint angle and delay estimation. Then, we optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS to minimize the CRB, subject to the communication rate requirement and the maximum transmit power constraint. In particular, we obtain the closed-form optimal solution in the case of single-target and single-user, and in the case of multi-target and multi-user scenario, the sparsity of the optimal solution is proven, leading to a reduction in computational complexity during optimization. The numerical results demonstrate that the optimized beamforming yields excellent positioning performance and effectively reduces the requirement for a large number of antennas at the BS.</description>

      <title>The Markov-Chain Polytope with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding a minimum-cost $m$-state Markov chain $(S_0,\ldots,S_{m-1})$ in a large set of chains. The chains studied have a reward associated with each state. The cost of a chain is its "gain", i.e., its average reward under its stationary distribution.
  Specifically, for each $k=0,\ldots,m-1$ there is a known set ${\mathbb S}_k$ of type-$k$ states. A permissible Markov chain contains exactly one state of each type; the problem is to find a minimum-cost permissible chain.
  The original motivation was to find a cheapest binary AIFV-$m$ lossless code on a source alphabet of size $n$. Such a code is an $m$-tuple of trees, in which each tree can be viewed as a Markov Chain state. This formulation was then used to address other problems in lossless compression. The known solution techniques for finding minimum-cost Markov chains were iterative and ran in exponential time.
  This paper shows how to map every possible type-$k$ state into a type-$k$ hyperplane and then define a "Markov Chain Polytope" as the lower envelope of all such hyperplanes. Finding a minimum-cost Markov chain can then be shown to be equivalent to finding a "highest" point on this polytope.
  The local optimization procedures used in the previous iterative algorithms are shown to be separation oracles for this polytope. Since these were often polynomial time, an application of the Ellipsoid method immediately leads to polynomial time algorithms for these problems.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the general distributed lossless/lossy source coding formulated by Jana and Blahut. Their multi-letter rate-distortion region, an alternative to the region derived by Yang and Qin, is characterized by entropy functions for arbitrary general correlated sources.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamical sampling problem on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ driven by a convolution operator defined by a convolution kernel. This problem is inspired by the need to recover a bandlimited heat diffusion field from space-time samples and its discrete analogue. In this book chapter, we review recent results in the finite-dimensional case and extend these findings to the infinite-dimensional case, focusing on the study of the density of space-time sampling sets.</description>

Abstract: Urn models for innovation capture fundamental empirical laws shared by several real-world processes. The so-called urn model with triggering includes, as particular cases, the urn representation of the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process and the Dirichlet process, seminal in Bayesian non-parametric inference. In this work, we leverage this connection to introduce a general approach for quantifying closeness between symbolic sequences and test it within the framework of the authorship attribution problem. The method demonstrates high accuracy when compared to other related methods in different scenarios, featuring a substantial gain in computational efficiency and theoretical transparency. Beyond the practical convenience, this work demonstrates how the recently established connection between urn models and non-parametric Bayesian inference can pave the way for designing more efficient inference methods. In particular, the hybrid approach that we propose allows us to relax the exchangeability hypothesis, which can be particularly relevant for systems exhibiting complex correlation patterns and non-stationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization with Formal Safety Guarantees via Online Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-box zero-th order optimization is a central primitive for applications in fields as diverse as finance, physics, and engineering. In a common formulation of this problem, a designer sequentially attempts candidate solutions, receiving noisy feedback on the value of each attempt from the system. In this paper, we study scenarios in which feedback is also provided on the safety of the attempted solution, and the optimizer is constrained to limit the number of unsafe solutions that are tried throughout the optimization process. Focusing on methods based on Bayesian optimization (BO), prior art has introduced an optimization scheme -- referred to as SAFEOPT -- that is guaranteed not to select any unsafe solution with a controllable probability over feedback noise as long as strict assumptions on the safety constraint function are met. In this paper, a novel BO-based approach is introduced that satisfies safety requirements irrespective of properties of the constraint function. This strong theoretical guarantee is obtained at the cost of allowing for an arbitrary, controllable but non-zero, rate of violation of the safety constraint. The proposed method, referred to as SAFE-BOCP, builds on online conformal prediction (CP) and is specialized to the cases in which feedback on the safety constraint is either noiseless or noisy. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data validate the advantages and flexibility of the proposed SAFE-BOCP.</description>

Abstract: We present a fault-tolerant [[8, 1, 3]] non-CSS quantum error correcting code and study its logical error rates. We choose the unitary encoding procedure for stabilizer codes given by Gottesman and modify it to suit the setting of a class of non- CSS codes. Considering two types of noise models for this study, namely the depolarising noise and anisotropic noise, to depict the logical error rates obtained in decoding, we adopt the procedure of the bare ancilla method presented by Brown et al. to reorder the measurement sequence in the syndrome extraction step and upgrade it to obtain higher pseudo-thresholds and lower leading order terms of logical error rates.</description>

      <title>High-probability minimax lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimax risk is often considered as a gold standard against which we can compare specific statistical procedures. Nevertheless, as has been observed recently in robust and heavy-tailed estimation problems, the inherent reduction of the (random) loss to its expectation may entail a significant loss of information regarding its tail behaviour. In an attempt to avoid such a loss, we introduce the notion of a minimax quantile, and seek to articulate its dependence on the quantile level. To this end, we develop high-probability variants of the classical Le Cam and Fano methods, as well as a technique to convert local minimax risk lower bounds to lower bounds on minimax quantiles. To illustrate the power of our framework, we deploy our techniques on several examples, recovering recent results in robust mean estimation and stochastic convex optimisation, as well as obtaining several new results in covariance matrix estimation, sparse linear regression, nonparametric density estimation and isotonic regression. Our overall goal is to argue that minimax quantiles can provide a finer-grained understanding of the difficulty of statistical problems, and that, in wide generality, lower bounds on these quantities can be obtained via user-friendly tools.</description>
