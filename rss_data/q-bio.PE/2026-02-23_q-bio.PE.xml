      <title>Epidemic "momentum" and a conservation law for infectious disease dynamics</title>

Abstract: Infectious disease outbreaks have precipitated a profusion of mathematical models. Epidemic curves predicted by these models are typically qualitatively similar, despite distinct model assumptions, but there is no theoretical explanation for this similarity in terms of any recognised common structure. In addition, fits of epidemic models to time series conflate pathogen transmissibility with pre-existing population immunity, so only a single composite parameter can be inferred. Here, we introduce a unifying concept of "epidemic momentum" -- prevalence weighted by potential to infect -- which is more informative than prevalence, yet analytically tractable. Epidemic momentum reveals a common underlying geometry in which outbreak trajectories always follow contours of a conserved quantity. This previously unrecognised conservation law constrains how epidemics can unfold, enabling us to disentangle transmissibility from prior immunity and to infer each separately from the same time series. We illustrate the significance of these insights with a novel reappraisal of the transmissibility of influenza during the 1918 pandemic. Beyond resolving an apparent identifiability problem, epidemic momentum also exposes the true final size of an outbreak and a universal phase-plane description that links generic renewal models to the classical SIR system. A broader concept of "population momentum" has the potential to illuminate seemingly intractable nonlinear dynamical processes in many other areas of science.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Public Goods Game in Dynamical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolutionary mechanisms of cooperative behavior represent a fundamental topic in complex systems and evolutionary dynamics. Real-world collective interactions, particularly in multi-agent systems, are often characterized by behavior-dependent mechanism switching where the environmental state is endogenously shaped by group strategies. However, existing models typically treat such environmental variations as static stochasticity and neglect the closed-loop feedback between environmental states and cooperative behaviors. Here, we introduce a dynamic environmental feedback mechanism into a nonlinear public goods game framework to establish a coevolutionary model that couples environmental states and individual cooperative strategies. Our results demonstrate that the interplay among environmental feedback, nonlinear effects, and environmental randomness can drive the system toward a wide variety of steady-state structures, including full defection, full cooperation, stable coexistence, and periodic limit cycles. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric nonlinear parameters and environmental feedback rates exert significant regulatory effects on cooperation levels and system dynamics. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory but also provides a foundation for modeling environmental feedback loops in scenarios ranging from ecological management to the design of cooperative mechanisms in autonomous systems.</description>
