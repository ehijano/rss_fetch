      <title>Serrin-type problem in divergence form on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an overdetermined boundary value problem of divergence type on bounded domains in Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. Using integral identities and the $P$-function method, we derive geometric inequalities and rigidity results. Under natural conditions on the nonlinearity, we prove that equality implies the domain is isometric to a Euclidean ball, thereby extending classical symmetry results to the Riemannian setting.</description>

      <title>Do Riemannian Submersions Preserve Positive Intermediate Ricci Curvature?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pro and the third author showed that there are Riemannian submersions $\pi: M \to B$ with $M$ a compact manifold with positive Ricci curvature, whose base $B$, has Ricci curvatures with both signs. Thus, Riemannian submersions need not preserve positive Ricci curvature. In this note we establish the degree to which this result extends into the setting of positive intermediate Ricci curvature.
  It is an immediate consequence of the Gray--O'Neill Horizontal curvature equation that if $\pi: M\to B$ is a Riemannian submersion whose base is $b$-dimensional and $\mathrm{Ric}_{k}(M) &gt;0$ for any $k \in \{ 1,2,\cdots, b-1\}$, then $ \mathrm{Ric}_{k}(B)$ is also positive. Here we show that this observation is optimal in the following strong sense:
  For $k \geq \mathrm{dim}(B)$, let $\pi: (M,g_M) \to (B,g_B)$ be a Riemannian submersion from a complete Riemannian manifold with $\mathrm{Ric}_{k}(M) &gt;0$. We show how to perturb $g_M$ in the $C^1$-topology to produce a Riemannian submersion $\pi: (M,\tilde{g}_M) \to (B,\tilde{g}_B)$ whose total space has $\mathrm{Ric}_{k} &gt;0$, but whose base has Ricci curvature of both signs.
  In particular, this shows that Riemannian submersions that do not preserve positive Ricci curvature are dense in the $C^1$-topology among the complete metrics on $M$ with $\mathrm{Ric}&gt;0$ for which a given submersion $\pi: M\to B$ is Riemannian.</description>

      <title>Positive intermediate Ricci curvature on cohomogeneity one manifolds in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore existence of invariant metrics with positive intermediate Ricci curvature on closed, low-dimensional cohomogeneity one manifolds. For a certain cohomogeneity one $\mathsf{Spin}(4)$-action on $S^3 \times \mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^2$, we construct an invariant metric with positive $4$-intermediate Ricci curvature and show it cannot admit one with positive $3$-intermediate Ricci curvature. We establish similar obstructions for several other cohomogeneity one manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we show that every conformal vector field on a Damek-Ricci space is necessarily a Killing vector field; in other words, there exists no non-trivial conformal vector field on such spaces. This result generalizes the corresponding theorem for complex hyperbolic spaces established in arXiv:2506.09710.</description>

      <title>The Alpha Group Dynamic Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical behavior of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governed by a matrix that represents the division in the algebra of the Alpha group. As the system evolves, the matrix induces topological transitions in geometric spaces, controlled by a rotational parameter. Numerical simulations are performed using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method implemented in Python. The results reveal the emergence of topological nodes, the existence of critical points at which the rotation between dividing planes transitions from 0 to $\pi/2$ radians. Near zero radians, the system exhibits a Euclidean geometric structure, while rotations close to $\pi/2$ define an Alpha Group space. At these nodes, the matrix-driven ODE system undergoes qualitative dynamic changes, reflecting distinct topological behaviors. The Alpha Group matrix is interpreted as a generator of symmetry transformations, potentially analogous to gauge fields under local or global symmetries. This work provides a computational framework for exploring dynamic topologies, attractors at infinity, and internal coherence in hyper-complex vector spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey deals with two closely connected topics: first, the stability of Einstein metrics under the Einstein-Hilbert functional, and second, their deformation theory and the study of the moduli space of Einstein metrics on a compact manifold. To first order, both problems reduce to studying the spectrum and eigentensors of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian. We give an introduction to the classical theory and survey recent results and advances.</description>

      <title>Discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary (III) -- Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work constitutes the third installment in a series of investigations devoted to discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary. In our preceding works \cite{X-Z DCS1, X-Z DCS2}, we established, respectively, a classification of these discrete conformal structures and results on their rigidity and existence. Building on this foundation, the present work focuses on the deformation theory of discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary. Specifically, we introduce the combinatorial Ricci flow and the combinatorial Calabi flow, and establish the longtime existence and global convergence of solutions to these combinatorial curvature flows. These results yield effective algorithms for finding discrete hyperbolic metrics on surfaces with totally geodesic boundaries of prescribed lengths.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature and a prescribed boundary in Euclidean space, represented as radial graphs over domains of the unit sphere. Under the assumptions that the mean curvature of the domain's boundary is positive and that a subsolution exists for the associated Dirichlet problem, we extend Serrin's classical result to include the case of positive constant mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Jacobi Hamiltonian Integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method of constructing structure-preserving integrators for Hamiltonian systems in Jacobi manifolds. Hamiltonian mechanics, rooted in symplectic and Poisson geometry, has long provided a foundation for modelling conservative systems in classical physics. Jacobi manifolds, generalizing both contact and Poisson manifolds, extend this theory and are suitable for incorporating time-dependent, dissipative and thermodynamic phenomena.
  Building on recent advances in geometric integrators - specifically Poisson Hamiltonian Integrators (PHI), which preserve key features of Poisson systems - we propose a construction of Jacobi Hamiltonian Integrators. Our approach explores the correspondence between Jacobi and homogeneous Poisson manifolds, with the aim of extending the PHI techniques while ensuring preservation of the homogeneity structure.
  This work develops the theoretical tools required for this generalization and outlines a numerical integration technique compatible with Jacobi dynamics. By focusing on the homogeneous Poisson perspective rather than on direct contact realizations, we provide a clear pathway for structure-preserving integration of time-dependent and dissipative systems within the Jacobi framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11715v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of Jacobi-Haantjes manifolds is proposed as a natural geometric framework useful to state the integrability of both conservative and dissipative Hamiltonian systems in a unified way. As a reduction, new structures such as contact-Haantjes and locally conformal symplectic-Haantjes manifolds are investigated. The main properties of these novel classes of manifolds and their mutual relationship are discussed. It is shown that the notion of Haantjes chains, within the framework of Jacobi geometry, is related to the existence of complete integrable contact Hamiltonian systems, encompassing also dissipative cases, as well as to the integrability of Hamiltonian systems on appropriate invariant submanifolds. Our framework naturally generalizes the formulation of integrable conservative Hamiltonian systems through the theory of symplectic-Haantjes (or {\omega}H) manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize formal integrability to construct a class of differential complexes, thereby providing a resolution for the sheaf of basic sections of a basic vector bundle, as well as a global realization of the Morse-Novikov-Treves complex. In the context of Levi flat structures, we introduce a notion of convexity for each Hermitian metric on a basic line bundle, which enables us to establish vanishing theorems and the global solvability of the Morse-Novikov-Treves complex. In the special case of elliptic structures, we further obtain results concerning singular cohomology and the extension problem for canonical forms.</description>

      <title>Quadratic flatness and Regularity for Codimension-One Varifolds with Bounded Anisotropic Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a uniformly convex norm $ \phi $ on $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ and a unit-density $ n $-dimensional varifold $ V $ in an open subset of $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ with bounded mean $ \phi $-curvature, under the hypothesis
  $$ \textrm{$\mathcal{H}^n \llcorner {\rm spt}\| V \| $ is absolutely continuous with respect to $ \| V \| $},$$
  we prove that there exists an open dense $ \mathscr{C}^{1, \alpha}$-regular part in $ {\rm spt} \| V \| $. Moreover we prove that the $ \mathscr{C}^{1, \alpha}$-regular part of $ V $ is $ \mathcal{H}^n $-almost equal to $({\rm spt}\| V \|)^\ast $, the subset of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ where at least one blow up (in Hausdorff distance) of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ is not equal to $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $.
  These results are consequences of a quadratic flatness theorem asserting that if $ V $ is a general -- not necessarily rectifiable -- varifold $ V $ with bounded mean $ \phi $-curvature and locally $ \mathcal{H}^n $-finite support, then the set of points $ R $ where $ {\rm spt}\| V \|$ admits (exactly) two mutually tangent balls satisfies $ \mathcal{H}^n(({\rm spt}\| V \|)^\ast \setminus R) =0 $ and meets each relatively open set of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ on a set of positive $ \mathcal{H}^n $-measure. Indeed, quadratic flatness at a point guarantees that the Allard anisotropic regularity theorem can be applied, hence proving that $ {\rm spt}\| V \|$ is regular around that point.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $3+1$ dimensions, we study the stability of Kasner solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system. This system incorporates gravity, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions for the initial stage of our universe. Due to the presence of the Vlasov field, various new challenges arise. By observing detailed mathematical structures and designing new delicate arguments, we identify a new strong sub-critical regime and prove the nonlinear stability with Kasner exponents lying in this full regime. This extends the result of Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck [8] from the Einstein-scalar field system to the physically more complex system with the Vlasov field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first obtain eigenvalue estimates for the Hodge Laplacian on Fano manifolds, which follow from the Bochner-Kodaira formula. Then we apply it to study the geometry of the Kuranishi family of deformations of Fano manifolds. We show that the original K\"ahler form remains to be a K\"ahler form for other members of the Kuranishi family, and give an explicit formula of the Ricci potential. We also show that our set-up gives another account for the Donaldson-Fujiki picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein universe $\mathbf{Ein}^{p,q}$ of signature $(p,q)$ is a pseudo-Riemannian analogue of the conformal sphere; it is the conformal compactification of the pseudo-Riemannian Minkowski space. For $p,q \geq 1$, we show that, up to a conformal transformation, there is only one almost-homogeneous domain in $\mathbf{Ein}^{p,q}$ that is bounded in a suitable stereographic projection. This domain, which we call a diamond, is a model for the symmetric space of $\operatorname{PO}(p,1) \times \operatorname{PO}(1,q)$. We deduce a classification of closed conformally flat manifolds with proper development.</description>

      <title>Discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary (II) -- Rigidity and Existence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{X-Z DCS1}, we introduced discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary via an axiomatic framework, and provided a classification of such discrete conformal structures. The present work focuses on the rigidity and existence of these discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary. As a direct consequence, the results by Guo-Luo in \cite{GL2} and Guo in \cite{Guo}, which deal with the rigidity and existence of discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary, are extended to a very general context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Lie group equipped with a left-invariant Riemannian metric. Let $K$ be a semisimple and normal subgroup of $G$ generating a left-invariant conformal foliation $\F$ of on $G$. We then show that the foliation $\F$ is Riemannian and minimal. This means that locally the leaves of $\F$ are fibres of a harmonic morphism. We also prove that if the metric restricted to $K$ is biinvariant then $\F$ is totally geodesic.</description>

      <title>Special Vinberg cones of rank 4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E.B. Vinberg developed a theory of homogeneous convex cones $C \subset V= \mathbb{R}^n$, which has many applications. He gave a construction of such cones in terms of non-associative rank $n$ matrix T-algebras $\cal{T}$, that consist of vector-valued $n \times n$ matrices $X = ||x_{ij}||, \, x_{ij} \in V_{ij} $ where $V_{ij}$ are Euclidean vector spaces. The multiplication in a T-algebra is determined by a system of isometric maps $V_{ij} \times V_{jk} \to V_{ik}$, s.t. $|v_{ij}\cdot v_{jk}| = |v_{ij}|\cdot |v_{jk}|$ that satisfies some axioms. A T-algebra is determined by its associative subalgebra of upper triangular matrices or its niladical $\mathcal{N}$, called the Nil-algebra. The connected Lie group $G$ of the upper triangular (non-degenerate) matrices acts in the vector space $Herm_n \subset\cal{T}$ of Hermitian matrices and the orbit $C = G(I)\subset Herm_n$ of the identity matrix $I$ is a convex cone with a simply transitive action of $G$. Conversely, any homogeneous convex cone is obtained by this construction.
  Generalizing the notion of rank 3 Clifford T-algebra, we define notions of rank $n$ special T-algebra and Clifford Nil-algebra, which define a special Vinberg cone. We associate with a Clifford Nil-algebra $\mathcal{N}$ a directed acyclic graph $\Gamma=\Gamma(\mathcal{N})$ of diameter 1 and show that Clifford Nil-algebras with given graph $\Gamma$ bijectively correspond to its admissible equipments. This gives an effective method of classification of Clifford Nil-algebras and associated special Vinberg cones.
  We apply this approach for explicit classification of rank 4 special Vinberg cones in terms of admissible equipment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of $W$-congruences is a central object of Projective Differential Geometry. Nevertheless, their singularities has not been extensively studied. In this paper we propose a new characterization of $W$-congruences that allow us to study their discriminant and umbilical points. We give examples of isolated stable umbilical points of type $A_m$, $m\in\{1,2,3,4\}$, and discuss some partial results concerning the generalizing of these results to any $m\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$.</description>

      <title>Zariski-dense deformations of standard discontinuous groups for pseudo-Riemannian homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X=G/H$ be a homogeneous space of a Lie group $G$. When the isotropy subgroup $H$ is non-compact, a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ may fail to act properly discontinuously on $X$. In this article, we address the following question: in the setting where $G$ and $H$ are reductive Lie groups and $\Gamma \backslash X$ is a standard quotient, to what extent can one deform the discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ while preserving the proper discontinuity of the action on $X$?
  We provide several classification results, including conditions under which local rigidity holds for compact standard quotients $\Gamma\backslash X$, when a standard quotient can be deformed into a non-standard quotient, a characterization of the largest Zariski-closure of discontinuous groups under small deformations, and conditions under which Zariski-dense deformations occur.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Adam to Manifolds for Efficiently Training Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16901v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the primary reasons behind the success of neural networks has been the emergence of an array of new, highly-successful optimizers, perhaps most importantly the Adam optimizer. It is widely used for training neural networks, yet notoriously hard to interpret. Lacking a clear physical intuition, Adam is difficult to generalize to manifolds. Some attempts have been made to directly apply parts of the Adam algorithm to manifolds or to find an underlying structure, but a full generalization has remained elusive.
  In this work a new approach is presented that leverages the special structure of the manifolds which are relevant for optimization of neural networks, such as the Stiefel manifold, the symplectic Stiefel manifold and the Grassmann manifold: all of these are homogeneous spaces and as such admit a global tangent space representation - a common vector space (Lie subspace) in which all tangent spaces can easily be represented.
  This global tangent space representation is used to perform all of the steps in the Adam optimizer and we are able to fully generalize the optimizer to manifolds without a projection step. The resulting algorithm is then applied to train a transformer for which orthogonality constraints are enforced up to machine precision and we observe significant speed-ups in the training process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03840v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a general Ohsawa-Takegoshi extension theorem by using the Ross-Witt Nystr\"om correspondence picture and Berndtsson's theorem in \cite{Bern20}. In the test configuration ($\mathbb C^*$-degeneration) case, our approach gives a quick proof of the Ohsawa-Takegoshi extension theorem without taking limit or using singular weight, which is very different from the Ohsawa-Chen-Blocki-Guan-Zhou approach and the Berndtsson-Lempert approach. Another advantage of our approach is that it fits better to the sharp estimate for the weighted Bergman kernel on compact manifold. Applications include a sharp lower bound of the Bergman kernel for compact Riemann surfaces and a non-vanishing theorem in terms of (weighted) Okounkov bodies.</description>

      <title>Discrete Laplacians -- spherical and hyperbolic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete Laplacian on Euclidean triangulated surfaces is a well-established notion. We introduce discrete Laplacians on spherical and hyperbolic triangulated surfaces. On the one hand, our definitions are close to the Euclidean one in that the edge weights contain the cotangents of certain combinations of angles and are non-negative if and only if the triangulation is Delaunay. On the other hand, these discretizations are structure-preserving in several respects. We prove that the area of a convex polyhedron can be written in terms of the discrete spherical Laplacian of the support function, whose expression is the same as the area of a smooth convex body in terms of the usual spherical Laplacian. We show that the conformal factors of discrete conformal vector fields on a triangulated surface of curvature $k \in \{-1,1\}$ are $-2k$-eigenfunctions of our discrete Laplacians, exactly as in the smooth setting. The discrete conformality can be understood here both in the sense of the vertex scaling and in the sense of circle patterns. Finally, we connect the $-2k$-eigenfunctions to infinitesimal isometric deformations of a polyhedron inscribed into corresponding quadrics.</description>

      <title>OGRePy: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: OGRePy is a modern, open-source Python package designed to perform symbolic tensor calculations, with a particular focus on applications in general relativity. Built on an object-oriented architecture, OGRePy encapsulates tensors, metrics, and coordinate systems as self-contained objects, automatically handling raising and lowering of indices, coordinate transformations, contractions, partial or covariant derivatives, and all tensor operations. By leveraging the capabilities of SymPy and Jupyter Notebook, OGRePy provides a robust, user-friendly environment that facilitates both research and teaching in general relativity and differential geometry. This Python package reproduces the functionality of the popular Mathematica package OGRe, while greatly improving upon it by making use of Python's native object-oriented syntax. In this paper, we describe OGRePy's design and implementation, and discuss its potential for reuse across research and education in mathematics and physics.</description>

      <title>The Hopf-Rinow theorem and the Ma\~n\'e critical value for magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subject of this article are magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres endowed with the round metric and with the magnetic potential given by the standard contact form. We compute the Ma\~n\'e's critical value of the system and show that a value of the energy is supercritical if and only if all pairs of points on the sphere can be connected by a magnetic geodesic with that value of the energy. Our methods are explicit and rely on the description of the submanifolds invariant by the flow and of the symmetries of the system, which we define for a general magnetic system and call totally magnetic submanifolds and magnetomorphisms, respectively. We recover hereby the known fact that the system is super-integrable: the three-spheres obtained intersecting the ambient space with a complex plane are totally magnetic and each magnetic geodesic is tangent to a two-dimensional Clifford torus. In our study the integral of motion given by the angle between magnetic geodesics and the Reeb vector field plays a special role, and can be used to realize the magnetic flow as an interpolation between the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow of the contact distribution and the Reeb flow of the contact form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first establish the weak stability results for solutions of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in relative full mass classes, extending the results known to hold in the full mass class. Building on weak stability, we then prove the $\mathcal{C}^{k,\alpha}$ stability of solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations on quasi-projective varieties. As an application, we study the limit of the singular Ricci-flat metrics on $\mathbb{Q}$-Calabi-Yau projective varieties, inspired by Tosatti's work on Calabi-Yau projective manifolds.</description>

      <title>Information Geometry on the $\ell^2$-Simplex via the $q$-Root Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \emph{$\ell^p$-information geometry}, an infinite dimensional framework that shares key features with the geometry of the space of probability densities \( \mathrm{Dens}(M) \) on a closed manifold, while also incorporating aspects of measure-valued information geometry. We define the \emph{$\ell^2$-probability simplex} with a noncanonical differentiable structure induced via the \emph{$q$-root transform} from an open subset of the $\ell^p$-sphere. This structure renders the $q$-root map an \emph{isometry}, enabling the definition of \emph{Amari--\v{C}encov $\alpha$-connections} in this setting.
  We further construct \emph{gradient flows} with respect to the $\ell^2$ Fisher--Rao metric, which solve an infinite-dimensional linear optimization problem. These flows are intimately linked to an \emph{integrable Hamiltonian system} via a \emph{momentum map} arising from a Hamiltonian group action on the infinite-dimensional complex projective space.</description>
