      <title>Beyond-all-order asymptotics for homoclinic snaking of localised patterns in reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially localised stationary patterns of arbitrary wide spatial extent emerge from subcritical Turing bifurcations in one-dimensional reaction-diffusion systems. They lie on characteristic bifurcation curves that oscillate around a Maxwell point in a homoclinic snaking phenomenon. Here, a generalisation of the exponential asymptotics method by Chapman \&amp; Kozyreff is developed to provide leading-order expressions for the width of the snaking region close to a Turing bifurcation's super/sub-critical transition in arbitrary $n$-component reaction-diffusion systems. First, general expressions are provided for the regular asymptotic approximation of the Maxwell point, which depends algebraically on the parametric distance from the codimension-two super/sub-critical Turing bifurcation. Then, expressions are derived for the width of the snaking, which is exponentially small in the same distance. The general theory is developed using a vectorised form of regular and exponential asymptotic expansions for localised patterns, which are matched at a Stokes line. Detailed calculations for a particular example are algebraically cumbersome, depend sensitively on the form of the reaction kinetics, and rely on the summation of a weakly convergent series obtained via optimal truncation. Nevertheless, the process can be automated, and code is provided that carries out the calculations automatically, only requiring the user to input the model, and the values of parameters at a codimension-two bifurcation. The general theory also applies to higher-order equations, including those that can be recast as a reaction-diffusion system. The theory is illustrated by comparing numerical computations of localised patterns in two versions of the Swift-Hohenberg equation with different nonlinearities, and versions of activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>Real-Valued Vector Modified Korteweg--de Vries Equation: Solitons Featuring Multiple Poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We delve into the inverse scattering transform of the real-valued vector modified Korteweg--de Vries equation, emphasizing the challenges posed by $N$ pairs of higher-order poles in the transmission coefficient and the enhanced spectral symmetry stemming from real-valued constraints. Utilizing the generalized vector cross product, we formulate an $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ matrix-valued Riemann--Hilbert problem to tackle the complexities inherent in multi-component systems. We subsequently demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a singularity-free equivalent problem, adeptly handling the intricacies of multiple poles. In reflectionless cases, we reconstruct multi-pole soliton solutions through a system of linear algebraic equations.</description>

      <title>Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of ultralight dark matter with non-negligible self-interactions are determined by a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the Vlasov equation of collisionless particles. This leads to wave-like effects, such as interferences, the formation of solitons, and a velocity field that is locally curl-free, implying that vorticity is carried by singularities associated with vortices. Using analytical derivations and numerical simulations in 2D, we study the evolution of such a system from stochastic initial conditions with nonzero angular momentum. Focusing on the Thomas-Fermi regime, where the de Broglie wavelength of the system is smaller than its size, we show that a rotating soliton forms in a few dynamical times. The rotation is not associated with a large orbital quantum number of the wave function. Instead, it is generated by a regular lattice of vortices that gives rise to a solid-body rotation in the continuum limit. Such rotating solitons have a maximal radius and rotation rate for a given central density, while the vortices follow the matter flow on circular orbits. We show that this configuration is a stable minimum of the energy at fixed angular momentum and we check that the numerical results agree with the analytical derivations. We expect most of these properties to extend to the 3D case where point vortices would be replaced by vortex rings.</description>

      <title>Anomalous bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear Rice-Mele model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence (BEC) constitutes a fundamental concept within the domain of topological physics, elucidating the profound interplay between the topological invariants that characterize the bulk states and the emergent edge states. A recent highlight along this research line consists of establishing BEC under the eigenvalue's nonlinearity in a linear Hamiltonian by introducing auxiliary eigenvalues [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.126601}{ T. Isobe {\it et al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)}]. The purpose of this work aims to extend Isobe's analysis to uncover BEC of eigenvalue's nonlinearity in intrinsic nonlinear Hamiltonians. To achieve this, we numerically solve the nonlinear Rice-Mele (RM) model and identify two distinct types of nonlinear eigenvalues: the intrinsically nonlinear eigenvalues and the eigenvalue's nonlinearity introduced through the incorporation of auxiliary eigenvalues. Furthermore, we establish a novel form of BEC based on these auxiliary nonlinear eigenvalues, which we term the anomalous BEC of a nonlinear physical system. The concept of the anomalous BEC defined herein provides a novel perspective on the intricate interplay between topology and nonlinearity in the context of BEC.</description>

      <title>Riemann--Hilbert method to the Ablowitz--Ladik equation: higher-order case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focused on the Ablowitz--Ladik equation on a zero background, specifically considering the scenario of $N$ pairs of multiple poles. Our first goal was to establish a mapping between the initial data and the scattering data. This allowed us to introduce a direct problem by analyzing the discrete spectrum associated with $N$ pairs of higher-order zeros. Next, we constructed another mapping from the scattering data to a $2\times2$ matrix Riemann--Hilbert problem equipped with several residue conditions set at $N$ pairs of multiple poles. By characterizing the inverse problem based on this Riemann--Hilbert problem, we were able to derive higher-order soliton solutions in the reflectionless case. Furthermore, we expressed an infinite-order soliton solution using a special Riemann--Hilbert problem formulation.</description>

      <title>Trees that can be grown in "too many" ways: A review of Bouch's construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carefully review the hierarchical construction by Bouch [Bouch2015] of trees on the square lattice that can be grown from its root in $L!/C^L$ distinct ways, where $L$ denotes the number of bonds constituting the tree, and $C&gt;1$ is a constant. (As discussed in Section IV.A of [ParkerCaoAvdoshkinScaffidiAltman2019] and Appendix A.3 of [ShiraishiTasaki2024], this result has an implication on the operator growth in quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions.)</description>
