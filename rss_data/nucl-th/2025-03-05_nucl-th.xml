      <title>Particle number projection on a spatial domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism of particle number on a spatial domain for mean field wave functions with pairing is revisited to account for the case where finite dimensional basis are used. The formulas differ from the ones previously used in the literature. It is shown that the present formalism has the right limit in the well known case of zero pairing whereas the other formalism do not satisfy this basic requirement. By using a simple one-dimensional model we illustrate the differences in the results for particle number distribution probability obtained with the two methods.</description>

      <title>Super-enhanced Nuclear Fusion in Metal-like Systems and in Condensed Plasmas of Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the scheme of chemonuclear reaction, bulk of itinerant s-electrons revealing the thermodynamical liquid activity in metallic systems undergo contact interaction with atomic nuclei and therein nucleons, inducing contagiously thermodynamical liquid activity among the bulk of nuclei under the irreversible action of Nature towards the chemical potential minimum resulting in the united spontaneous, irreversible atomic and nuclear reactions. The chemonuclear reaction, moreover, is enhanced with astronomical figures besides the enhancement of few particle processes (e.g., in the electron-screened pycnonuclear fusion). In the systems of metal-like hydride/deuteride and electron donor mixtures, self-sustained H-H and D-D chemonuclear fusion may take place. In these systems, however, some unforeseen phenomena are induced, e.g., radiation-less fusion and $\gamma$-ray missing positron annihilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study (nuclear) fusion reactions in Beryllium. We argue that some are nuclear long-distance molecular processes of interest for low energy nuclear reactions. For these we develop a novel reaction model. We note a chain of reactions that can naturally arise in Beryllium target created by nonequilibrium proton reactions.</description>

      <title>Momentum Flow and Forces on Quarks in the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Momentum conservation in the nucleon is examined in terms of continuous flow of the momentum density current (or in short, momentum flow), which receives contributions from both kinetic motion and interacting forces involving quarks and gluons. While quarks conduct momentum flow through their kinetic motion and the gluon scalar (anomaly) contributes via pure interactions, the gluon stress tensor has both effects. The quarks momentum flow encodes the information of the force density on them, and the momentum conservation allows to trace its origin to the gluon tensor and anomaly ("negative pressure"). From state-of-the-art lattice calculations and experimental fits on the form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, we exhibit pictures of the momentum flow and forces on the quarks in the nucleon. In particular, the anomaly contributes a critical attractive force with a strength similar to that of a QCD confinement potential.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive analysis of the $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0(1385)$, $\gamma n \to K^+ \Sigma^-(1385)$, and $\pi^+ p \to K^+ \Sigma^+(1385)$ reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of all available data on cross sections and spin-dependent observables for the $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0(1385)$, $\gamma n \to K^+ \Sigma^-(1385)$, and $\pi^+ p \to K^+ \Sigma^+(1385)$ reactions is performed within an effective Lagrangian framework. In addition to the $s$-channel $N$ exchange, $t$-channel $K$ and $K^\ast$ exchanges, $u$-channel $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$, and $\Sigma^\ast$ exchanges, and the interaction current, the $s$-channel contributions from a minimal set of $N$ and $\Delta$ resonances are included in constructing the reaction amplitudes to describe the data. The analysis reveals that all available data for both photon- and hadron-induced $K\Sigma(1385)$ production reactions can be simultaneously and satisfactorily reproduced when the contribution of the $s$-channel $\Delta(1930){5/2}^-$ resonance is taken into account. The reaction mechanisms, particularly the resonance contributions in each considered reaction, are thoroughly analyzed and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>The Electron-Ion Collider as A Prospective Facility for Pentaquark Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider provides a groundbreaking opportunity to study heavy pentaquarks with unprecedented precision, leveraging its high collision energy and beam spin polarization capabilities. As a representative case, we analyze electroproduction cross sections of Pc (4312) under different spin-parity hypotheses using the vector meson dominance model. To ensure a parameter-free approach and minimize ambiguity, we incorporate results from the LHCb and GlueX experiments. To characterize the spin and the parity of Pc (4312), we propose measuring the beam spin asymmetry and decay kinematic polarization, quantities that can be accurately determined by the ePIC detector. Our approach can be extended to investigate other heavy pentaquarks produced in electron-proton and electron-deuteron collisions, as well as to study their interactions with nuclear matter in electron-heavy ion collisions. We strongly encourage the EIC community to explore this potential and integrate pentaquark studies as a critical element of the scientific mission.</description>

      <title>Exploring jet transport coefficients by elastic scattering in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interaction of leading jet partons in a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) medium based on the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM). The DQPM describes the non-perturbative nature of the sQGP at finite temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ based on a propagator representation of massive off-shell partons (quarks and gluons) whose properties (characterized by spectral functions with $T,\mu_B$ dependent masses and widths) are adjusted to reproduce the lQCD EoS for the QGP in thermodynamic equilibrium. We present the results for the jet transport coefficients, i.e. the transverse momentum transfer squared per unit length $\hat{q}$ as well as the energy loss per unit length $\Delta E =dE/dx$, in the QGP and investigate their dependence on the temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ as well as on jet properties such as the leading jet parton momentum, mass, flavor, and the choice of the strong coupling constant. In this first study only elastic scattering processes of a leading jet parton with the sQGP partons are explored discarding presently the radiative processes (such as gluon Bremsstrahlung). We present a comparison of our results for the elastic energy loss in the sQGP medium with the pQCD results obtained by the BAMPS and LBT models as well as with other theoretical approaches such as lattice QCD and the LO-HTL and also with estimates of $\hat{q}/T^3$ by the color string percolation model (CSPM) and the JET and JETSCAPE Collaborations based on a comparison of hydrodynamical calculations with experimental heavy-ion data.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Selection Rules for $^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ in a $6\alpha$ Cluster Model with $\mathcal{D}_{4h}$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of a macroscopic $\alpha$-cluster model, the structural properties and the spectroscopy of the $^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ nucleus are investigated. Special attention is devoted to the electromagnetic selection rules imposed by the point-symmetry group $\mathcal{D}_{4h}$ that leaves invariant the adopted $6\alpha$ equilibrium configuration, a square bipyramid. The analysis entails the application of group-theoretical identities and character tables, in a way familiar to quantum chemists. The results show that the occurrence of interband E0, E2, and M1, M2, M3 transitions is strictly regulated by the transformation properties of the excited vibrational modes to which the states in the process belong. Unlike the $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ nucleus in the $\mathcal{D}_{3h}$-symmetric $3\alpha$ arrangement, M1 transition channels are active between states corresponding to a single quantum of vibrational excitation. Conversely, the measured E1 strengths in the $^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ spectrum are attributable to the excitation of single-nucleon degrees of freedom, as E1 transitions are forbidden by the model. The present investigation is a only part of a wider work, encompassing the spectrum and the whole electromagnetic properties of this nucleus in the considered $\mathcal{D}_{4h}$-symmetric configuration, in preparation.</description>

      <title>Exploring jet transport coefficients by elastic and radiative scatterings in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction of leading jet partons within a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) medium, using the effective dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM). The DQPM offers a description of the sQGP's non-perturbative nature at finite temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ through a propagator representation of massive off-shell partons (quarks and gluons). These partons are characterized by spectral functions with $T,\mu_B$ dependent masses and widths, adjusted to reproduce the lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (lQCD) equation-of-state (EoS) for the QGP in thermodynamic equilibrium. Our focus lies on examining the jet transport coefficients by elastic scattering in sQGP, specifically the transverse momentum transfer squared per unit length denoted as $\hat{q}$, within the QGP. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of these coefficients on both the medium temperature $T$ and the jet parton energy. By studying the jet transport coefficients and their relationship to temperature and parton energy, we aim to gain insights into the dynamics of jet propagation in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma medium.</description>

      <title>Influence of the chiral magnetic effect on particle-pair elliptic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance in quantum chromodynamics. The CME-sensitive, azimuthal correlator difference $\Delta\gamma$ between opposite-sign (OS) and same-sign (SS) charged hadron pairs is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle elliptic anisotropy ($v_2$). The CME signal, on the other hand, contributes to the difference in the pair elliptic anisotropies between OS and SS pairs ($\Delta v_{2,\rm pair}$). We investigate $\Delta v_{2,\rm pair}$ and found its sensitivity to CME to be similar to that of the $\Delta\gamma$ observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between strong azimuthal correlations, known as alignment, in families of hadrons and photons observed in cosmic ray experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles together with the transverse momentum conservation are tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. The results show that the high degree of alignment can appear in nucleus-nucleus interactions at reasonable values of the transverse momentum disbalance of most energetic detected particles.</description>

      <title>$2+1$ dimensional Floquet systems and lattice fermions: Exact bulk spectral equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connection has recently been proposed between periodically driven systems known as Floquet insulators in continuous time and static fermion theories in discrete time. This connection has been established in a $(1+1)$-dimensional free theory, where an explicit mapping between the spectra of a Floquet insulator and a discrete-time Dirac fermion theory has been formulated. Here we investigate the potential of static discrete-time theories to capture Floquet physics in higher dimensions, where so-called anomalous Floquet topological insulators can emerge that feature chiral edge states despite having bulk bands with zero Chern number. Starting from a particular model of an anomalous Floquet system, we provide an example of a static discrete-time theory whose bulk spectrum is an exact analytic match for the Floquet spectrum. The spectra with open boundary conditions in a particular strip geometry also match up to finite-size corrections. However, the models differ in several important respects. The discrete-time theory is spatially anisotropic, so that the spectra do not agree for all lattice terminations, e.g. other strip geometries or on half spaces. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the static discrete-time model is quasi-one-dimensional in nature and therefore has a different bulk-boundary correspondence than the Floquet model.</description>
