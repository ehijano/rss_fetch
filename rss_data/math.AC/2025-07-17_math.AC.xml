      <title>Equivariant Free Resolutions of Sequences of Symmetric Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of related modules $M_n$ over a sequence of related Noetherian polynomial rings, where each $M_n$ is a representation of the symmetric group on $n$ letters, one may ask how to simultaneously compute an equivariant free resolution of each $M_n$. In this article, we address this question. Working in the setting of FI-modules over a Noetherian polynomial FI-algebra, we provide an algorithm for computing syzygies and FI-equivariant differentials. As an application, we show how this result can be used to compute truncations of equivariant free resolutions of ideals in polynomial rings in infinitely many variables that are invariant under actions of the monoid of strictly increasing maps or of permutations. The free modules occurring in such a free resolution are finitely generated up to symmetry.</description>

      <title>Numerical Semigroups of Sally Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Judith Sally proved in 1980 that the associated graded ring of one-dimensional Gorenstein local rings of multiplicity $e$ and embedding dimension $e-2$ are Cohen-Macaulay. She showed that the defining ideal of the associated graded ring of such rings is generated by ${e-2 \choose 2}$ elements. Numerical semigroup rings are a big class of one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay rings. In 2014, Herzog and Stamate proved that the numerical semigroup $&lt;e,e+1,e+4,\ldots,2e-1 &gt;$ defines a Gorenstein semigroup ring satisfying Sally's conditions above and such semigroups are called Gorenstein Sally Semigroups. We call a numerical semigroup $S$ as Sally type if $&lt;S &gt;= &lt; e,e+1,\ldots,e+m-1, e+m+1,\ldots, e+n-1,e+n+1, \ldots 2e-1&gt;$ for some $2 \leq m &lt;n \leq e-2$. In this paper, we give a formula for its Frobenius number along with a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be Gorenstein. We compute the minimal number of generators for the defining ideal of the semigroup ring $k[S]$. Additionally, we present an algorithm and a GAP code used in applying Hochster's combinatorial formula to compute the first Betti number of $k[S]$.</description>

      <title>Bounded powers of edge ideals: symmetric exchange binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that the toric ideal of the base ring of a discrete polymatroid is generated by symmetric exchange binomials. In the present paper, we give several classes of discrete polymatroids which yield toric ideals generated by symmetric exchange binomials. Especially, we are interested in the discrete polymatroids arising from bounded powers of edge ideals of finite graphs.</description>

      <title>A comparison of the regularity of certain classes of monomial ideals and their integral closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S = \mathsf{k}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, $I$ be an ideal of $S$, and $\bar{I}$ denote its integral closure. A conjecture of K\"{u}ronya and Pintye states that for any homogeneous ideal $I$ of $S$, the inequality $\operatorname{reg}(\bar{I}) \leq \operatorname{reg}(I)$ holds, where $\operatorname{reg}(\_)$ denotes the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. In this article, we prove the conjecture for certain classes of monomial ideals.</description>

      <title>Waldschmidt constants of symmetric sets of points in $\mathbb{P}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Configurations of points defined by complex reflection groups have attracted a lot of attention recently in several directions of research, e.g., the containment problem between ordinary and symbolic powers of ideals, in the theory of unexpected hypersurfaces, in the study of sets of points whose general projections are complete intersections and in the ideas revolving around the Bounded Negativity Conjecture. In order to understand these configurations better several attempts have been undertaken to compute their various invariants. In this paper we focus on their Waldschmidt constants. In the case of plane configurations of points determined by reflection groups most (but not all) Waldschmidt constants are known. Here we pass to configurations in $\mathbb{P}^3$ where new ideas are required as the identification between divisors and curves is no longer available. In particular, we precisely compute the Waldschmidt constant for configurations of points in $\mathbb{P}^3$ coming from the $D_4,B_4,F_4$, and $H_4$ root systems.</description>

      <title>Homogeneity of zero-divisors, units and idempotents in a graded ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove several important results on graded rings, especially monoid-rings, that are motivated and inspired by Kaplansky's zero-divisor, unit and idempotents conjectures. Among the main results, we first generalize Kaplansky's zero-divisor conjecture of group-rings $K[G]$ (with $K$ a field) to the more general setting of $G$-graded rings $R=\bigoplus\limits_{n\in G}R_{n}$ with $G$ a torsion-free group. Then we prove that ...</description>
