      <title>Tight entropy bound based on p-quasinorms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we prove a family of tight upper and lower bounds for the Shannon entropy and von Neumann entropy based on the p-norms. This allows us to have an entropy estimate, a criterion for the finiteness of it and a bound on the difference of entropy, additionally, we did some numerical tests that show the efficiency of our approximations.</description>

      <title>Multi-User SR-LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme for coordinated uplink channels. The scheme builds on the recently proposed sparse-regression low-density parity-check (SR-LDPC) code, and extends the underlying notions to scenarios with many concurrent users. The resulting scheme, called Multi-User SR-LDPC (MU-SR-LDPC) coding, consists of each user transmitting its own SR-LDPC codeword using a unique sensing matrix in conjunction with a characteristic outer LDPC code. To recover the sent information, the decoder jointly processes the received signals using a low-complexity and highly-parallelizable AMP-BP algorithm. At finite blocklengths (FBL), MU-SR-LDPC codes are shown to achieve a target BER at a higher spectral efficiency than baseline orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes with similar computational complexity. Furthermore, MU-SR-LDPC codes are shown to match the performance of maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding in certain regimes. For certain blocklengths and a sufficiently high number of users, MU-SR-LDPC codes may achieve a higher spectral efficiency than the approximate FBL capacity of the effective single-user Gaussian channel seen by each user in a comparable OMA scheme. Results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A new class of S-boxes with optimal Feistel boomerang uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feistel Boomerang Connectivity Table ($\rm{FBCT}$), which is the Feistel version of the Boomerang Connectivity Table ($\rm{BCT}$), plays a vital role in analyzing block ciphers' ability to withstand strong attacks, such as boomerang attacks. However, as of now, only four classes of power functions are known to have explicit values for all entries in their $\rm{FBCT}$. In this paper, we focus on studying the FBCT of the power function $F(x)=x^{2^{n-2}-1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Through certain refined manipulations to solve specific equations over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ and employing binary Kloosterman sums, we determine explicit values for all entries in the $\rm{FBCT}$ of $F(x)$ and further analyze its Feistel boomerang spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate that this power function exhibits the lowest Feistel boomerang uniformity.</description>

      <title>How to Read and Update Coded Distributed Storage Robustly and Optimally?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of robust dynamic coded distributed storage (RDCDS) that is associated with the coded distributed storage of a message with $N$ servers where 1) it suffices to recover the message from the storage at any $R_r$ servers; and 2) each of the servers stores a coded portion of the message that is at most $\frac{1}{K_c}$ the size of the message. The goal is to enable two main functionalities: the read operation and the update operation of the message. Specifically, at time slot $t$, the user may execute either the read operation or the update operation, where the read operation allows the user to recover the message from the servers, and the update operation allows the user to update the message to the servers in the form of an additive increment so that any up to $X^{(t)}$ colluding servers reveal nothing about the increment. The two functionalities are robust if at any time slot $t$ 1) they tolerate temporarily dropout servers up to certain thresholds (the read threshold is $R_r$ and the update threshold is denoted as $R_u^{(t)}$); and 2) the user may remain oblivious to prior server states. The communication efficiency is measured by the download cost $C_r^{(t)}$ of the read operation and the upload cost $C_u^{(t)}$ of the update operation. Given $K_c$ and $R_r$, we are curious about the optimal $(R_u^{(t)},C_r^{(t)},C_u^{(t)})$ tuple. In this work, we settle the fundamental limits of RDCDS. In particular, denoting the number of dropout servers at time slot $t$ as $|\mathcal{D}^{(t)}|$, we first show that 1) $R_u^{(t)}\geq N-R_r+\lceil K_c\rceil+X^{(t)}$; and 2) $C_r^{(t)}\geq \frac{N-|\mathcal{D}^{(t)}|}{N-R_r+\lceil K_c\rceil-|\mathcal{D}^{(t)}|}, C_u^{(t)}\geq \frac{N-|\mathcal{D}^{(t)}|}{R_r-X^{(t)}-|\mathcal{D}^{(t)}|}$. Then, inspired by the idea of staircase codes, we construct an RDCDS scheme that simultaneously achieves the above lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Active learning for efficient data selection in radio-signal based positioning via deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of user equipment (UE) positioning based on radio signals via deep learning. As in most supervised-learning tasks, a critical aspect is the availability of a relevant dataset to train a model. However, in a cellular network, the data-collection step may induce a high communication overhead. As a result, to reduce the required size of the dataset, it may be interesting to carefully choose the positions to be labelled and to be used in the training. We therefore propose an active learning approach for efficient data collection. We first show that significant gains (both in terms of positioning accuracy and size of the required dataset) can be obtained for the considered positioning problem using a genie. This validates the interest of active learning for positioning. We then propose a \textcolor{blue}{practical} method to approximate this genie.</description>

      <title>Effective Wordle Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While previous researchers have performed an exhaustive search to determine an optimal Wordle strategy, that computation is very time consuming and produced a strategy using words that are unfamiliar to most people. With Wordle solutions being gradually eliminated (with a new puzzle each day and no reuse), an improved strategy could be generated each day, but the computation time makes a daily exhaustive search impractical. This paper shows that simple heuristics allow for fast generation of effective strategies and that little is lost by guessing only words that are possible solution words rather than more obscure words.</description>

      <title>Optical ISAC: Fundamental Performance Limits and Transceiver Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal capacity-distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point (P2P) system with single-input single-output for communication and single-input multiple-output for sensing (SISO-SIMO-C/S) within an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. Our results show these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) as sensing antennas increase. We also demonstrate that the achievable rate-CRB (AR-CRB) serves as an outer bound (OB) for the optimal C-D region. To optimize input distribution across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: an iterative Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA)-type method and a memory-efficient closed-form (CF) approach, including a CF optimal distribution for high optical signal-to-noise ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we extend and modify the Deterministic-Random Tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upper bounds on the minimum Lee distance of codes that are linear over $\mathbb{Z}_q$ are discussed. The bounds are Singleton like, depending on the length, rank, and alphabet size of the code. Codes meeting such bounds are referred to as Maximum Lee Distance (MLD) Codes. We present some new bounds, proved using combinatorial arguments. The new bounds provide improvements over those in the literature.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral gaps of random one-dimensional quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral gap of local random quantum circuits is a fundamental property that determines how close the moments of the circuit's unitaries match those of a Haar random distribution. When studying spectral gaps, it is common to bound these quantities using tools from statistical mechanics or via quantum information-based inequalities. By focusing on the second moment of one-dimensional unitary circuits where nearest neighboring gates act on sets of qudits (with open and closed boundary conditions), we show that one can exactly compute the associated spectral gaps. Indeed, having access to their functional form allows us to prove several important results, such as the fact that the spectral gap for closed boundary condition is exactly the square of the gap for open boundaries, as well as improve on previously known bounds for approximate design convergence. Finally, we verify our theoretical results by numerically computing the spectral gap for systems of up to 70 qubits, as well as comparing them to gaps of random orthogonal and symplectic circuits.</description>

      <title>A Little Confidence Goes a Long Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a group of related methods for binary classification tasks using probes of the hidden state activations in large language models (LLMs). Performance is on par with the largest and most advanced LLMs currently available, but requiring orders of magnitude fewer computational resources and not requiring labeled data. This approach involves translating class labels into a semantically rich description, spontaneous symmetry breaking of multilayer perceptron probes for unsupervised learning and inference, training probes to generate confidence scores (prior probabilities) from hidden state activations subject to known constraints via entropy maximization, and selecting the most confident probe model from an ensemble for prediction. These techniques are evaluated on four datasets using five base LLMs.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preservation in Delay-Based Localization Systems: Artificial Noise or Artificial Multipath?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization plays an increasingly pivotal role in 5G/6G systems, enabling various applications. This paper focuses on the privacy concerns associated with delay-based localization, where unauthorized base stations attempt to infer the location of the end user. We propose a method to disrupt localization at unauthorized nodes by injecting artificial components into the pilot signal, exploiting model mismatches inherent in these nodes. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of two techniques, namely artificial multipath (AM) and artificial noise (AN), in mitigating location leakage. By leveraging the misspecified Cram\'er-Rao bound framework, we evaluate the impact of these techniques on unauthorized localization performance. Our results demonstrate that pilot manipulation significantly degrades the accuracy of unauthorized localization while minimally affecting legitimate localization. Moreover, we find that the superiority of AM over AN varies depending on the specific scenario.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Signal Processing: Unleashing the Power of Proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After nearly a century of specialized applications in optics, remote sensing, and acoustics, the near-field (NF) electromagnetic propagation zone is experiencing a resurgence in research interest. This renewed attention is fueled by the emergence of promising applications in various fields such as wireless communications, holography, medical imaging, and quantum-inspired systems. Signal processing within NF sensing and wireless communications environments entails addressing issues related to extended scatterers, range-dependent beampatterns, spherical wavefronts, mutual coupling effects, and the presence of both reactive and radiative fields. Recent investigations have focused on these aspects in the context of extremely large arrays and wide bandwidths, giving rise to novel challenges in channel estimation, beamforming, beam training, sensing, and localization. While NF optics has a longstanding history, advancements in NF phase retrieval techniques and their applications have lately garnered significant research attention. Similarly, utilizing NF localization with acoustic arrays represents a contemporary extension of established principles in NF acoustic array signal processing. This article aims to provide an overview of state-of-the-art signal processing techniques within the NF domain, offering a comprehensive perspective on recent advances in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating S-Band Interference: Impact of Satellite Systems on Terrestrial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The co-existence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) is essential for achieving global coverage in sixth-generation cellular networks. Due to increasing spectrum demand, there is discussion in the world level to share some frequencies used in terrestrial Networks (TNs) with NTNs, resulting in co-channel interference and performance degradation. This paper analyzes the interference caused by satellite networks on TN in the S-band. We examined the transmission mechanisms of satellite signals and conducted simulations to evaluate interference intensity across varying slant ranges. Our findings indicate that the angle between the user equipment direction and the sub-satellite point direction from the beam center significantly impacts the interference level.</description>

      <title>Trellis BMA: Coded Trace Reconstruction on IDS Channels for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequencing a DNA strand, as part of the read process in DNA storage, produces multiple noisy copies which can be combined to produce better estimates of the original strand; this is called trace reconstruction. One can reduce the error rate further by introducing redundancy in the write sequence and this is called coded trace reconstruction. In this paper, we model the DNA storage channel as an insertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channel and design both encoding schemes and low-complexity decoding algorithms for coded trace reconstruction.
  We introduce Trellis BMA, a new reconstruction algorithm whose complexity is linear in the number of traces, and compare its performance to previous algorithms. Our results show that it reduces the error rate on both simulated and experimental data. The performance comparisons in this paper are based on a new dataset of traces that will be publicly released with the paper. Our hope is that this dataset will enable research progress by allowing objective comparisons between candidate algorithms.</description>

      <title>Improved Field Size Bounds for Higher Order MDS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher order MDS codes are an interesting generalization of MDS codes recently introduced by Brakensiek, Gopi and Makam (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2022). In later works, they were shown to be intimately connected to optimally list-decodable codes and maximally recoverable tensor codes. Therefore (explicit) constructions of higher order MDS codes over small fields is an important open problem. Higher order MDS codes are denoted by $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$ where $\ell$ denotes the order of generality, $\operatorname{MDS}(2)$ codes are equivalent to the usual MDS codes. The best prior lower bound on the field size of an $(n,k)$-$\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$ codes is $\Omega_\ell(n^{\ell-1})$, whereas the best known (non-explicit) upper bound is $O_\ell(n^{k(\ell-1)})$ which is exponential in the dimension.
  In this work, we nearly close this exponential gap between upper and lower bounds. We show that an $(n,k)$-$\operatorname{MDS}(3)$ codes requires a field of size $\Omega_k(n^{k-1})$, which is close to the known upper bound. Using the connection between higher order MDS codes and optimally list-decodable codes, we show that even for a list size of 2, a code which meets the optimal list-decoding Singleton bound requires exponential field size; this resolves an open question from Shangguan and Tamo (STOC 2020 / SIAM J. on Computing 2023).
  We also give explicit constructions of $(n,k)$-$\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$ code over fields of size $n^{(\ell k)^{O(\ell k)}}$. The smallest non-trivial case where we still do not have optimal constructions is $(n,3)$-$\operatorname{MDS}(3)$. In this case, the known lower bound on the field size is $\Omega(n^2)$ and the best known upper bounds are $O(n^5)$ for a non-explicit construction and $O(n^{32})$ for an explicit construction. In this paper, we give an explicit construction over fields of size $O(n^3)$ which comes very close to being optimal.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sum Rate Enhancement by Using Dual-Side IOS-Assisted Full-Duplex for Multi-User MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper established a novel multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication network, in the presence of full-duplex (FD) transmitters and receivers with the assistance of dual-side intelligent omni surface. Compared with the traditional IOS, the dual-side IOS allows signals from both sides to reflect and refract simultaneously, which further exploits the potential of metasurfaces to avoid frequency dependence, and size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations. By considering both the downlink and uplink transmissions, we aim to maximize the weighted sum rate, subject to the transmit power constraints of the transmitter and the users and the dual-side reflecting and refracting phase shifts constraints. However, the formulated sum rate maximization problem is not convex, hence we exploit the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach, and tackle the original problem iteratively by solving two sub-problems. For the beamforming matrices optimizations of the downlink and uplink, we resort to the Lagrangian dual method combined with a bisection search to obtain the results. Furthermore, we resort to the quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) method to optimize the reflecting and refracting phase shifts of both sides of the IOS. In addition, we introduce the case without a dual-side IOS for comparison. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of the dual-side IOS.</description>

      <title>Indirect Lossy Source Coding with Observed Source Reconstruction: Nonasymptotic Bounds and Second-Order Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the joint compression of a pair of correlated sources, where the encoder is allowed to access only one of the sources. The objective is to recover both sources under separate distortion constraints for each source while minimizing the rate. This problem generalizes the indirect lossy source coding problem by also requiring the recovery of the observed source. In this paper, we aim to study the nonasymptotic and second-order asymptotic properties of this problem. Specifically, we begin by deriving nonasymptotic achievability and converse bounds valid for general sources and distortion measures. The source dispersion (Gaussian approximation) is then determined through asymptotic analysis of the nonasymptotic bounds. We further examine the case of erased fair coin flips (EFCF) and provide its specific nonasymptotic achievability and converse bounds. Numerical results under the EFCF case demonstrate that our second-order asymptotic approximation closely approximates the optimum rate at appropriately large blocklengths.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Positioning Via Ray Tracing With Noisy Angle of Arrival Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00611v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the positioning problem in non line-of-sight (NLoS) situations, where several base stations (BS) try to locate a user equipment (UE) based on uplink angle of arrival (AoA) measurements and a digital twin of the environment. Ray launching in a Monte Carlo manner according to the AoA statistics enables to produce a map of points for each BS. These points represent the intersections of the rays with a xy plane at a given user equipment (UE) elevation. We propose to fit a parametric probability density function (pdf), such as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), to each map of points. Multiplying the obtained pdfs for each BS enables to compute the position probability of the UE. This approach yields an algorithm robust to a reduced number of launched rays. Moreover, these parametric pdfs may be fitted and stored in an offline phase such that ray tracing can be avoided in the online phase. This significantly reduces the computational complexity of the positioning method.</description>

      <title>Joint Constellation Shaping Using Gradient Descent Approach for MU-MIMO Broadcast Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a learning-based approach to optimize a joint constellation for a multi-user MIMO broadcast channel ($T$ Tx antennas, $K$ users, each with $R$ Rx antennas), with perfect channel knowledge. The aim of the optimizer (MAX-MIN) is to maximize the minimum mutual information between the  transmitter and each receiver, under a sum-power constraint. The proposed optimization method do neither impose the transmitter to use superposition coding (SC) or any other linear precoding, nor to use successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. Instead, the approach designs a joint constellation, optimized such that its projection into the subspace of each receiver $k$, maximizes the minimum mutual information $I(W_k;Y_k)$ between each transmitted binary input $W_k$ and the output signal at the intended receiver $Y_k$. The rates obtained by our method are compared to those achieved with linear precoders.</description>

      <title>Understanding is Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern data compression methods are slowly reaching their limits after 80 years of research, millions of papers, and wide range of applications. Yet, the extravagant 6G communication speed requirement raises a major open question for revolutionary new ideas of data compression.
  We have previously shown all understanding or learning are compression, under reasonable assumptions. Large language models (LLMs) understand data better than ever before. Can they help us to compress data?
  The LLMs may be seen to approximate the uncomputable Solomonoff induction. Therefore, under this new uncomputable paradigm, we present LMCompress. LMCompress shatters all previous lossless compression algorithms, doubling the lossless compression ratios of JPEG-XL for images, FLAC for audios, and H.264 for videos, and quadrupling the compression ratio of bz2 for texts. The better a large model understands the data, the better LMCompress compresses.</description>

      <title>On Confidence Sequences for Bounded Random Processes via Universal Gambling Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of constructing a confidence sequence, which is a sequence of confidence intervals that hold uniformly over time, for estimating the mean of bounded real-valued random processes. This paper revisits the gambling-based approach established in the recent literature from a natural \emph{two-horse race} perspective, and demonstrates new properties of the resulting algorithm induced by Cover (1991)'s universal portfolio. The main result of this paper is a new algorithm based on a mixture of lower bounds, which closely approximates the performance of Cover's universal portfolio with constant per-round time complexity. A higher-order generalization of a lower bound on a logarithmic function in (Fan et al., 2015), which is developed as a key technique for the proposed algorithm, may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a decoder for the correction of erasures with hypergraph product codes, which form one of the most popular families of quantum LDPC codes. Our numerical simulations show that this decoder provides a close approximation of the maximum likelihood decoder that can be implemented in O(N^2) bit operations where N is the length of the quantum code. A probabilistic version of this decoder can be implemented in O(N^1.5) bit operations.</description>

      <title>Gambling-Based Confidence Sequences for Bounded Random Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A confidence sequence (CS) is a sequence of confidence sets that contains a target parameter of an underlying stochastic process at any time step with high probability. This paper proposes a new approach to constructing CSs for means of bounded multivariate stochastic processes using a general gambling framework, extending the recently established coin toss framework for bounded random processes. The proposed gambling framework provides a general recipe for constructing CSs for categorical and probability-vector-valued observations, as well as for general bounded multidimensional observations through a simple reduction. This paper specifically explores the use of the mixture portfolio, akin to Cover's universal portfolio, in the proposed framework and investigates the properties of the resulting CSs. Simulations demonstrate the tightness of these confidence sequences compared to existing methods. When applied to the sampling without-replacement setting for finite categorical data, it is shown that the resulting CS based on a universal gambling strategy is provably tighter than that of the posterior-prior ratio martingale proposed by Waudby-Smith and Ramdas.</description>

      <title>Circuit Knitting Faces Exponential Sampling Overhead Scaling Bounded by Entanglement Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circuit knitting, a method for connecting quantum circuits across multiple processors to simulate nonlocal quantum operations, is a promising approach for distributed quantum computing. While various techniques have been developed for circuit knitting, we uncover fundamental limitations to the scalability of this technology. We prove that the sampling overhead of circuit knitting is exponentially lower bounded by the exact entanglement cost of the target bipartite dynamic, even for asymptotic overhead in the parallel cut regime. Specifically, we prove that the regularized sampling overhead assisted with local operations and classical communication (LOCC), of any bipartite quantum channel is lower bounded by the exponential of its exact entanglement cost under separable preserving operations. Furthermore, we show that the regularized sampling overhead for simulating a general bipartite channel via LOCC is lower bounded by $\kappa$-entanglement and max-Rains information, providing efficiently computable benchmarks. Our work reveals a profound connection between virtual quantum information processing via quasi-probability decomposition and quantum Shannon theory, highlighting the critical role of entanglement in distributed quantum computing.</description>
