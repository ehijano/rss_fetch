      <title>A finite viscoelastic constitutive model for low to high strain rate response of elastomers with application of strain rate-induced glass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous elastomers exhibit significant rate-stiffening and unique viscous flow characteristics across a wide range of strain rates, often undergoing glass transition above a strain rate threshold. We have developed a thermodynamically-consistent and micromechanically-inspired constitutive model for soft elastomeric materials to capture the rate-dependent stress-strain behavior and hysteresis when subjected to low to high strain rates. Our proposed constitutive model encapsulates the viscous flow of materials through molecular motion at low strain rates and local rearrangement and alignment at high strain rates, essentially covering the glass transition. We applied our constitutive model to uniaxial compression experiments performed at low and high strain rates for polyborosiloxane (PBS) to identify the material parameters, and subsequently, performed numerical simulations of single and multi-cycle compression, stress relaxation, and small amplitude oscillatory tension-compression. Our analyses indicate that the model predicts higher total energy dissipation with increasing strain rate; however, dissipation associated with molecular relaxation decreases (forming a cusp) because, beyond a crossover strain rate, molecular rearrangement and alignment become dominant, which is consistent with the onset of the glass transition. For cyclic loading-unloading, we observed that dissipation over a cycle remains constant at low strain rate but decreases non-monotonically at high strain rates before becoming constant with peak stress over the cycle becoming higher, which can be interpreted as more loading being carried elastically by the polymer network as the molecular rearrangement process occurs. Additionally, our model was able to predict the qualitative nature of the storage modulus and loss modulus in the limit of small strain over a wide range of frequency sweeps.</description>

      <title>Molecular signatures of pressure-induced phase transitions in a lipid bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how lipid bilayers respond to pressure is essential for interpreting the coupling between membrane proteins and their native environments. Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamics to examine the pressure-temperature behavior of model membranes composed of DMPC or $\Delta$9-cis-PC. Within the studied range (288-308 K, 1-2000 bar), DMPC undergoes a liquid--gel transition, while $\Delta$9-cis-PC remains fluid due to unsaturation. The CHARMM36 force field reproduces experimental boundaries with high fidelity: simulated DMPC transitions deviate by only 5-10 K and 100-300 bar, and $\Delta$9-cis-PC exhibits no transition. Hysteresis is modest but most pronounced when starting from low-temperature gels. We identify area per lipid, bilayer thickness, and acyl-chain gauche fraction as sensitive phase markers; among these, the gauche fraction provides the most robust signature. Simulations indicate an interdigitated gel is the equilibrium structure under finite-size conditions. However, at low temperature and high pressure, interdigitation decreases, consistent with the experimental lamellar gel phase. This long-lived interdigitation critically impacts standard order parameters, specifically area per lipid and membrane thickness. These results underscore the accuracy of modern force fields and highlight how simulations mechanistically complement experimental studies of pressure-regulated membranes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-parametric distributional regression has achieved significant milestones in recent years. Among these, the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. However, a challenge remains in extending these grid-based approaches to a truly multivariate setting. In a naive non-parametric discretization with $N$ bins per dimension, the complexity of an explicit joint grid scales exponentially and the paramer count of the neural networks rise sharply. This scaling is particularly detrimental in low-data regimes, as the final projection layer would require many parameters, leading to severe overfitting and intractability.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing from collective dynamics of active colloidal oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing is a computational framework that offers an energy- and computation-efficient alternative to conventional training of neural networks. In reservoir computing, input signals are mapped into the high-dimensional dynamics of a nonlinear system, and only a simple readout layer is trained. In most physical implementations, the interactions that give rise to the dynamics cannot be tuned directly and high dimensionality is typically achieved through time-multiplexing, which can limit flexibility and efficiency. Here we introduce a reservoir composed of hundreds of hydrodynamically coupled active colloidal oscillators forming a fully parallel physical reservoir and whose coupling strength and fading-memory time can be tuned in situ. The collective dynamics of the active oscillators allow accurate predictions of chaotic time series from single reservoir readouts without time-multiplexing. We further demonstrate real-time detection of subtle hidden anomalies that preserve all instantaneous statistical properties of the signal yet disrupt its underlying temporal correlations. These results establish interacting active colloids as a reconfigurable platform for physical computation and edge-integrated intelligent sensing for model-free detection of irregularities in complex time signals.</description>

      <title>Early bloodmaterial interfacial events and capillary transport on nanoparticle modified nanofibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrospun poly(\epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)nanofibrous mats are widely considered for blood-contacting wound dressings and small-diameter vascular applications; however, their intrinsic hydrophobicity limits rapid wetting and controlled interaction with blood. In this work, we modulate the interfacial response of PCL nanofibers by incorporating oxide-shelled silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid, a ligand-free approach that avoids organic stabilizers and preserves surface reactivity. Two composite architectures were designed: SiNPs embedded within the fiber bulk (PAC1,4,16) and SiNPs preferentially exposed at the fiber surface (SPAC1,4,16), with systematically increasing nanoparticle loadings. Structural characterization confirmed the retention of a homogeneous fibrous morphology and the targeted nanoparticle distribution. The dynamic interaction with whole blood was quantified using time-resolved contact-angle measurements, complemented by top-view optical microscopy and three-dimensional profilometry of dried droplets. Pristine PCL remained strongly hydrophobic whereas a hydrophilic PCL functionalized with APTES showed rapid spreading. Incorporation of SiNPs within the fiber volume led to only a moderate enhancement of wettability, and dried droplets retained compact morphologies with limited spreading. In contrast, surface-decorated mats displayed a sharp, concentration-dependent transition toward highly wettable behavior: for SPAC16, the contact angle fell below 20, droplet profiles became markedly flattened, and microscopy revealed extended plasma-rich regions surrounding a red-cell-rich core, indicative of pronounced phase separation within the nanofibrous network.</description>

      <title>Topological origin of peak splitting in the structure factor of liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The splitting of the principal peak in the structure factor of liquid water is commonly interpreted as evidence of a competition between two distinct local environments. Here, we show that this peak splitting arises from medium-range topological features of the hydrogen-bond network. Using atomistic simulations, we systematically decompose the structure factor into contributions from hydrogen-bonded rings of different sizes. We find that 5-8-membered rings, which dominate the network topology of liquid water at low temperatures, can directly explain the experimentally observed bimodal scattering signal. Among these, 5-membered rings are particularly persistent, maintaining distinct structural signatures even above room temperature. Our findings establish a direct link between the network topology of liquid water and experimentally accessible diffraction features, clarifying the microscopic basis of water's behaviour and suggesting a broader conceptual framework for interpreting the anomalies in tetrahedral network liquids and glasses.</description>

      <title>Learning microstructure in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding microstructure in terms of closed-form expressions is an open challenge in nonequilibrium statistical physics. We propose a simple and generic method that combines particle-resolved simulations, deep neural networks and symbolic regression to predict the pair-correlation function of passive and active particles. Our analytical closed-form results closely agree with Brownian dynamics simulations, even at relatively large packing fractions and for strong activity. The proposed method is broadly applicable, computationally efficient, and can be used to enhance the predictive power of nonequilibrium continuum theories and for designing pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Reverse segregation and self-organization in inclined chute flows of bidisperse granular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the usual segregation scenario for stable inclined chute flows of bidisperse mixtures of fine and coarse spherical particles, coarse particles rise toward the free surface, forming a coarse-rich region atop the flowing pile. Beyond a threshold coarse-to-fine diameter ratio of approximately 4, conversely, the weight of the coarse particles exceeds the segregation driving forces, causing individual coarse particles to sink within the pile and producing a reversed segregation state. However, an understanding of the collective evolution of the pile structure is still lacking when the particle diameter ratio exceeds 4 {\textit{and}} the coarse particle mass fraction is appreciable. To explore this broadly bidisperse limit, we perform discrete element method simulations considering mean particle diameter ratios of up to 8 and coarse particle mass fractions spanning 0.1 to 0.9. The steady-state flow profiles reveal several intriguing behaviors that depend on the diameter ratio and mass fraction. These include a previously identified transition from usual to reverse segregation and a newfound tendency to self-organize into alternating coarse- and fine-rich particle layers stacked along the shear gradient direction, with layer thickness dictated by the coarse particle diameter. A fuller understanding of segregation at this scale could pave the way for enhanced mixing or demixing techniques at the commercial scale.</description>

      <title>Flow-wave coupling synchronizes oscillations in growing active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory biochemical signals and mechanical forces must coordinate robustly during development, yet the principles governing their mutual coupling remain poorly understood. In syncytial embryos and cell-free extracts, mitotic waves propagate across millimeter scales while simultaneously generating cytoplasmic flows, suggesting a two-way interaction between chemical oscillators and mechanics. Here, we combine experiments in Xenopus Laevis cytoplasmic extracts with a minimal particle-based model to reveal a mechanochemical feedback that stabilizes phase wave propagation. In contrast to previous models of oscillatory active matter, an asymmetric size cycle, slow growth and rapid shrinkage, combined with size-dependent mechanical interactions generates a net particle displacement and flows aligned with the wave direction, which in turn drive a synchronization transition. Our results show that mechanical forces actively maintain the coherence of biochemical waves, providing a general mechanism for long-range order in oscillating active matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making use of the Griffith criticality condition recently introduced by Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (Extreme Mechanics Letters 58: 101944, 2023), this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers. The results -- comprised of a combination of a parametric study and direct comparisons with experiments -- reveal how the non-Gaussian elasticity, the nonlinear viscosity, and the intrinsic fracture energy of elastomers interact and govern when fracture nucleates from the pre-existing crack in these tests. The results also serve to quantify the limitations of existing analyses, wherein viscous effects and the actual geometries of the pre-existing cracks and the specimens are neglected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mean-square displacement (MSD) of a tracer particle diffusing in a granular gas of inelastic hard spheres under homogeneous cooling state (HCS). Tracer and granular gas particles are in general mechanically different. Our approach uses a series representation of the MSD where the $k$-th term is given in terms of the mean scalar product $\langle \mathbf{r}_1\cdot\mathbf{r}_k \rangle$, with $\mathbf{r}_i$ denoting the displacements of the tracer between successive collisions. We find that this series approximates a geometric series with the ratio $\Omega$. We derive an explicit analytical expression of $\Omega$ for granular gases in three dimensions, and validate it through a comparison with the numerical results obtained from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Our comparison covers a wide range of masses, sizes, and inelasticities. From the geometric series, we find that the MSD per collision is simply given by the mean-square free path of the particle divided by $1-\Omega$. The analytical expression for the MSD derived here is compared with DSMC data and with the first- and second-Sonine approximations to the MSD obtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzmann equation. Surprisingly, despite their simplicity, our results outperforms the predictions of the first-Sonine approximation to the MSD, achieving accuracy comparable to the second-Sonine approximation.</description>

      <title>From Light Diffusion to Photocatalytic Rates: Compact Scaling Laws for Strongly Scattering Porous Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light transport in strongly scattering porous photocatalytic materials governs the spatial distribution of absorbed photons and therefore the generation of charge carriers driving photocatalytic reactions. Yet translating measured optical properties of such media into intrinsic reaction rate constants remains challenging, as it requires simultaneously accounting for multiple scattering, boundary losses, photochemical efficiency, and surface kinetics. Here we develop a compact analytical framework that unifies these processes for nanoparticle-loaded photocatalytic slabs. Using a finite-slab diffusion model with extrapolated boundaries, we derive closed-form expressions for the fluence field and couple them to a photochemical quantum efficiency and first-order surface kinetics. The resulting predictors yield intrinsic volumetric and areal rate constants whose dependence on the transport mean free path, optical thickness, and surface-to-volume ratio emerges transparently. Validation against Monte-Carlo photon-migration simulations shows that the diffusion approximation reproduces the fluence and generation-rate profiles with a modest multiplicative mismatch, typically within a factor of about 1.20-1.39, depending on the anisotropy and scattering phase function. This level of agreement is consistent with the known limits of the diffusion approximation and is sufficient to enable reliable, design-oriented predictions. The analytical descriptors introduced here, such as l*, S/V and the extrapolation length zb are general, physically interpretable, and directly integrable into data-driven optimisation and geometry-engineered reactor design. The framework thus provides a versatile and physically grounded tool for photocatalytic systems across diverse applications, including VOC photo-degradation, indoor air purification, and solar-fuel production.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution &lt; 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.</description>
