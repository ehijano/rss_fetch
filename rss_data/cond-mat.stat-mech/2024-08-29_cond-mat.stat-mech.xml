      <title>Effects of kinetic energy on heat fluctuations of passive and active overdamped driven particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To describe the spatial trajectory of an overdamped Brownian particle, inertial effects can be neglected. Yet, at the energetic level of stochastic thermodynamics, changes in kinetic energy must be considered to accurately predict the heat exchanged with the thermal bath. On the other hand, in the presence of external driving forces, one would expect the effects of kinetic energy fluctuations to be reduced, as thermal noise becomes comparatively less relevant. Here, we investigate the competition between the kinetic energy and the external work contributions to the heat statistics of passive and active overdamped Brownian particles subject to external driving forces. We find that kinetic energy effects cause fluctuations in the exchanged heat to become non-Gaussian. To evaluate the relevance of these effects, we compute the excess kurtosis and the Pearson correlation. For fixed parameter values adapted from experiments, we identify a crossover transition from a regime in which the stochastic heat of overdamped particles is dominated by external work, where kinetic energy changes can be safely ignored, to a regime dominated by kinetic energy effects. Our results also provide a quantitative analytical way to assess how deep into a particular regime the system is.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of switching processes: general results and applications to intermittent active motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems switching between different dynamical phases is an ubiquitous phenomenon. The general understanding of such a process is limited. To this end, we present a general expression that captures fluctuations of a system exhibiting a switching mechanism. Specifically, we obtain an exact expression of the Laplace-transformed characteristic function of the particle's position. Then, the characteristic function is used to compute the effective diffusion coefficient of a system performing intermittent dynamics. Further, we employ two examples: 1) Generalized run-and-tumble active particle, and 2) an active particle switching its dynamics between generalized active run-and-tumble motion and passive Brownian motion. In each case, explicit computations of the spatial cumulants are presented. Our findings reveal that the particle's position probability density function exhibit rich behaviours due to intermittent activity. Numerical simulations confirm our findings.</description>

      <title>Enhancing precision thermometry with nonlinear qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermometry refers to the study of measuring ultra-low temperatures in quantum systems. The precision of such a quantum thermometer is limited by the degree to which temperature can be estimated by quantum measurements. More precisely, the maximal precision is given by the inverse of the quantum Fisher information. In the present analysis, we show that quantum thermometers that are described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations allow for a significantly enhanced precision, that means larger quantum Fisher information. This is demonstrated for a variety of pedagogical scenarios consisting of single and two-qubits systems. The enhancement in precision is indicated by non-vanishing quantum speed limits, which originate in the fact that the thermal, Gibbs state is typically not invariant under the nonlinear equations of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adiabatic invariance of the thermodynamic entropy invites a connection with Noether's theorem, which has been the subject of various papers. Here we include macroscopic dynamics known as $\texttt{GENERIC}$ for which the dynamical fluctuations show a canonical structure. We find a continuous symmetry of the corresponding path-space action when restricting to quasistatic trajectories, with the thermodynamic entropy as Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between a disjoint subsystem and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuations and Many-Body Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many-body systems with U(1) global symmetry, the charge fluctuations in a subregion reveal important insights into entanglement and other global properties. For subregions with sharp corners, bipartite fluctuations have been predicted to exhibit a universal shape dependence on the corner angle in certain quantum phases and transitions, characterized by a "universal angle function" and a "universal coefficient." However, we demonstrate that this simple formula is insufficient for charge insulators, including composite fermi liquids. In these systems, the corner contribution may depend on the corner angle, subregion orientation, and other microscopic details. We provide an infinite series representation of the corner term, introducing orientation-resolved universal angle functions with their non-universal coefficients. In the small-angle limit or under orientation averaging, the remaining terms' coefficients are fully determined by the many-body quantum metric, which, while not universal, adheres to both a universal topological lower bound and an energetic upper bound. We also clarify the conditions for bound saturation in (anisotropic) Landau levels, leveraging the generalized Kohn theorem and holomorphic properties of many-body wavefunctions. We find that a broad class of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions, including unprojected parton states and composite-fermion Fermi sea wavefunctions, saturates the bounds.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, correlation functions, and entanglement of general quantum Motzkin spin-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motzkin spin-chains, which include 'colorless' (integer spin $s=1$) and 'colorful' ($s \geq 2$) variants, are one-dimensional (1D) local integer spin models notable for their lack of a conformal field theory (CFT) description of their low-energy physics, despite being gapless. The colorful variants are particularly unusual, as they exhibit power-law violation of the area-law of entanglement entropy (as $\sqrt{n}$ in system size $n$), rather than a logarithmic violation as seen in a CFT. In this work, we analytically discover several unique properties of these models, potentially suggesting a new universality class for their low-energy physics. We identify a complex structure of symmetries and unexpected scaling behavior in spin-spin correlations, which deviate from known 1D universality classes. Specifically, the $s=1$ chain exhibits $U(1)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking and ferromagnetic order. Meanwhile, the $s \geq 2$ chains do not appear to spontaneously break any symmetries, but display quasi-long-range algebraic order with power-law decaying correlations, inconsistent with standard Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical exponents. We also derive exact asymptotic scaling expressions for entanglement measures in both colorless and colorful chains, generalizing previous results of Movassagh [J. Math Phys. (2017)], while providing benchmarks for potential quantum simulation experiments. The combination of hardness of classically simulating such systems along with the analytical tractability of their ground state properties position Motzkin spin chains as intriguing candidates for exploring quantum computational advantage in simulating many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In the context of dynamical purification transitions, scrambling dynamics sustain extensive and positive coherent information at low measurement rates, but noises can suppress it to zero or negative values. Here we introduce quantum-enhanced operations into a noisy monitored quantum circuit. This circuit, viewed as a quantum channel, undergoes a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. This transition is modulated by the relative frequency of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. The existence of a recoverable phase implies that quantum-enhanced operations can facilitate reliable quantum information transmission in the presence of diverse noises. Remarkably, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum simulation. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Convective Instability Driven by Diffusiophoresis of Colloids in Binary Liquid Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a binary fluid mixture, the concentration gradient of a heavier molecular solute leads to a diffusive flux of solvent and solute to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium. If the solute concentration decreases with height, the system is always in a condition of stable mechanical equilibrium against gravity. We show experimentally that this mechanical equilibrium becomes unstable in case colloidal particles are dispersed uniformly within the mixture, and that the resulting colloidal suspension undergoes a transient convective instability with the onset of convection patterns. By means of a numerical analysis, we clarify the microscopic mechanism from which the observed destabilisation process originates. The solute concentration gradient drives an upward diffusiophoretic migration of colloids, in turn causing the development of a mechanically unstable layer within the sample, where the density of the suspension increases with height. Convective motions arise to minimize this localized rise in gravitational potential energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum decoherence is the effect that bridges quantum physics to well-understood classical physics. As such, it plays a crucial role in understanding the mysterious nature of quantum physics represented by Schr\"odinger's cat, for example. Quantum decoherence is also a source of quantum noise that has to be well under control in quantum computing and in various experiments based on quantum technologies. Here we point out that quantum decoherence can be captured by $\textit{complex}$ saddle points in the Feynman path integral in much the same way as quantum tunneling can be captured by instantons. In particular, we present some first-principle calculations in the Caldeira-Leggett model, which reproduce the predicted scaling behavior of quantum decoherence with respect to the parameters of the environment such as the temperature and the coupling to the system of interest. We also discuss how to extend our work to general models by Monte Carlo calculations using a recently developed method to overcome the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Universal mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Thermodynamically favourable reactions such as ATP hydrolysis are used by the cell to convert chemical energy into useful structure, function, and mechanical work. This includes the `fuelled' catalysis of chemical reactions that would otherwise be thermodynamically unfavourable. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. Here, we present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. By considering the different aspects of the dynamics, such as the interplay of the non-equilibrium drive and the geometry of the enzyme-substrate complex, we propose three golden rules that should be universally applicable for de novo design of enzymes, as they are based on generic ingredients and physical constraints. These rules lead to optimal combinations of parameters, which can vastly accelerate reactions, while at the same time decreasing the energy dissipation of the combined reaction process, or, in other words, to an efficient enzyme. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Clausius' theorem and the Second law in the process of isoenergetic thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isoenergetic thermalization amongst $n$ bodies is a well-known irreversible process, bringing the bodies to a common temperature $T_F$ and leading to a rise in the total entropy of the bodies. We express this change in entropy using the Clausius formula over a reversible path connecting $T_F$ with $T_f$ which corresponds to the entropy-preserving temperature of the initial nonequilibrium state. Under the assumption of positive heat capacities of the bodies, the Second law inequality simply follows from the fact that $T_F &gt; T_f$. We extend this approach to the continuum case of an unequally heated rod, illustrating with the special case of the rod with constant heat capacity and a linear temperature profile. An interpolating profile between the discrete and the continuum models is studied whereby $T_f$, given by the geometric mean temperature over $n$ elements, is shown to approach the identric mean of the lowest and the highest temperatures as $n$ becomes large. We also discuss the case of negative heat capacity in a two-body set up where isoenergetic thermalization may be forbidden by the Second law. However, the alternate scheme in which first work is performed reversibly on the system and then an equivalent amount of energy is extracted in the form of heat, brings the system to an energy-preserving common temperature.</description>

      <title>Is stochastic thermodynamics the key to understanding the energy costs of computation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between the thermodynamic and computational characteristics of dynamical physical systems has been a major theoretical interest since at least the 19th century, and has been of increasing practical importance as the energetic cost of digital devices has exploded over the last half century. One of the most important thermodynamic features of real-world computers is that they operate very far from thermal equilibrium, in finite time, with many quickly (co-)evolving degrees of freedom. Such computers also must almost always obey multiple physical constraints on how they work. For example, all modern digital computers are periodic processes, governed by a global clock. Another example is that many computers are modular, hierarchical systems, with strong restrictions on the connectivity of their subsystems. This properties hold both for naturally occurring computers, like brains or Eukaryotic cells, as well as digital systems. These features of real-world computers are absent in 20th century analyses of the thermodynamics of computational processes, which focused on quasi-statically slow processes. However, the field of stochastic thermodynamics has been developed in the last few decades - and it provides the formal tools for analyzing systems that have exactly these features of real-world computers. We argue here that these tools, together with other tools currently being developed in stochastic thermodynamics, may help us understand at a far deeper level just how the fundamental physical properties of dynamic systems are related to the computation that they perform.</description>

      <title>Quantum limitation on experimental testing of non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems</title>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems (NFTs) relate work performed on a system as its Hamiltonian varies with time, to equilibrium data of the initial and final states. In a classical context the system energy can be directly measured, while a quantum implementation requires the incorporation of a work-agent. We demonstrate that the uncertainty principle imposes inherent quantum limitations on the applicability of the NFT for probing non-trivial mesoscopic systems. We work out the NFT validity regime for the simplest quantum-dot toy model, and discuss future applications.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum thermodynamics in a non-equilibrium regime: Application to Stirling engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a thermodynamic theory in the non-equilibrium regime, which we describe as a thermodynamic system-bath model [S. Koyanagi and Y. Tanimura, J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{160}, 234112 (2024)]. Based on the dimensionless (DL) minimum work principle, non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials are expressed in terms of non-equilibrium extensive and intensive variables in time derivative form. This is made possible by incorporating the entropy production rate into the definitions of non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials. These potentials can be evaluated from the DL non-equilibrium-to-equilibrium minimum work principle, which is derived from the principle of DL minimum work and is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics. We thus obtain the non-equilibrium Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the non-equilibrium Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energies. Unlike fluctuation theorem and stochastic thermodynamics theory, this theory does not require the assumption of a factorized initial condition and is valid in the full quantum regime where the system and bath are quantum mechanically entangled. Our results are numerically verified by simulating a thermostatic Stirling engine consisting of two isothermal processes and two thermostatic processes using the quantum hierarchical Fokker--Planck equations and the classical Kramers equation derived from the thermodynamic system-bath model. We then show that, from weak to strong system-bath interactions, the thermodynamic process can be analyzed using a non-equilibrium work diagram analogous to the equilibrium one for given time-dependent intensive variables. The results can be used to develop efficient heat machines in non-equilibrium regimes.</description>

Abstract: We derive the formula for the stationary states of particle-number conserving exclusion processes infinitesimally perturbed by inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. The formula not only proves but also generalises the conjecture proposed in arXiv:1711.06949 to account for inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. As an application of the formula, we draw part of the phase diagrams of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process with and without Langmuir kinetics, correctly reproducing known results.</description>

      <title>A theorem on extensive ground state entropy, spin liquidity and some related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06236v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of the paradigmatic one-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model $J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + h \sum_i \sigma^z_i$ is well-known. Instead, let us imagine "applying" the transverse field via a transverse Ising coupling of the spins to partner auxiliary spins, i.e. $H= J_x \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + J_z \sum_i \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{\text{partner of }i}$. If each spin of the chain has a unique auxiliary partner, then the resultant eigenspectrum is still the same as that of the quantum Ising model with $\frac{h}{J} = \frac{J_z}{J_x}$ and the degeneracy of the entire spectrum is $2^{\text{number of auxiliary spins}}$. We can interpret this as the auxiliary spins remaining paramagnetic down to zero temperature and an extensive ground state entropy. This follows from the existence of extensively large and mutually \guillemotleft anticommuting\guillemotright $\;$ sets of $local$ conserved quantities for $H$. Such a structure will be shown to be not unnatural in the class of bond-dependent Hamiltonians. In the above quantum Ising model inspired example of $H$, this is lost upon the loss of the unique partner condition for the full spin chain. Other cases where such degeneracy survives or gets lost are also discussed. Thus this is more general and forms the basis for an exact statement on the existence of extensive ground state entropy in any dimension. Furthermore this structure can be used to prove spin liquidity non-perturbatively in the ground state manifold. Higher-dimensional quantum spin liquid constructions based on this are given which may evade a quasiparticle description.</description>

      <title>Holographic analysis of boundary correlation functions for the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze boundary spin correlation functions of the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model from the holographic point of view. Using the corner-transfer-matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method, we demonstrate that the boundary correlation function exhibits power-law decay with quasi-periodic oscillation, while the bulk correlation function always decays exponentially. On the basis of the geometric relation between the bulk correlation path and distance along the outer edge boundary, we find that scaling dimensions for the boundary correlation function can be well explained by the combination of the bulk correlation length and background curvatures inherent to the hyperbolic lattice. We also investigate the cutoff effect of the bond dimension in CTMRG, revealing that the long-distance behavior of the boundary spin correlation is accurately described even with a small bond dimension. In contrast, the sort-distance behavior rapidly loses its accuracy.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic quantum Fokker-Planck equations and their application to thermostatic Stirling engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a computer code for the thermodynamic quantum Fokker-Planck equations (T-QFPE), derived from a thermodynamic system-bath model. This model consists of an anharmonic subsystem coupled to multiple Ohmic baths at different temperatures, which are connected to or disconnected from the subsystem as a function of time. The code numerically integrates the T-QFPE and their classical expression to simulate isothermal, isentropic, thermostatic, and entropic processes in both quantum and classical cases. The accuracy of the results was verified by comparing the analytical solutions of the Brownian oscillator. Additionally, we illustrated a breakdown of the Markovian Lindblad-master equation in the pure quantum regime. As a demonstration, we simulated a thermostatic Stirling engine under quasi-static conditions. The quasi-static thermodynamic potentials, described as intensive and extensive variables, were depicted as work diagrams. In the classical case, the work done by the external field is independent of the system-bath coupling strength. In contrast, in the quantum case, the work decreases as the coupling strength increases due to quantum entanglement between the subsystem and bath. The codes were developed for multicore processors using Open multiprocessing (OpenMP) and for graphics processing units (GPU) using the Compute United Device Architecture (CUDA). These codes are provided as supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>Fidelity-dissipation relations in quantum gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantum computing relies on the precision of quantum gates. However, quantum gates in practice are generally affected by dissipative environments, which can significantly reduce their fidelity. In this study, we elucidate fundamental relations between the average fidelity of generic quantum gates and the dissipation that occurs during the computing processes. Considering scenarios in which a quantum gate is subject to Markovian environments, we rigorously derive fidelity-dissipation relations that hold for arbitrary operational times. Intriguingly, when the quantum gate undergoes thermal relaxation, the result can be used as a valuable tool for estimating dissipation through experimentally measurable fidelity, without requiring detailed knowledge of the dissipative structure. For the case of arbitrary environments, we uncover a trade-off relation between the average fidelity and energy dissipation, implying that these quantities cannot be large simultaneously. Our results unveil the computational limitations imposed by thermodynamics, shedding light on the profound connection between thermodynamics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of probabilistic context-sensitive grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), which are commonly used to generate trees randomly, have been well analyzed theoretically, leading to applications in various domains. Despite their utility, the distributions that the grammar can express are limited to those in which the distribution of a subtree depends only on its root and not on its context. This limitation presents a challenge for modeling various real-world phenomena, such as natural languages. To overcome this limitation, a probabilistic context-sensitive grammar (PCSG) is introduced, where the distribution of a subtree depends on its context. Numerical analysis of a PCSG reveals that the distribution of a symbol does not constitute a qualitative difference from that in the context-free case, but mutual information does. Furthermore, a novel metric introduced to directly quantify the breaking of this limitation detects a distinct difference between PCFGs and PCSGs. This metric, applicable to an arbitrary distribution of a tree, allows for further investigation and characterization of various tree structures that PCFGs cannot express.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: A recently developed approach to the thermodynamics of open quantum systems, on the basis of the principle of minimal dissipation, is applied to the spin-boson model. Employing a numerically exact quantum dynamical treatment based on the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we investigate the influence of the environment on quantities such as work, heat and entropy production in a range of parameters which go beyond the weak-coupling limit and include both the non-adiabatic and the adiabatic regimes. The results reveal significant differences to the weak-coupling forms of work, heat and entropy production, which are analyzed in some detail.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of noninteracting electrons, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry; we further generalize the conclusion to interacting systems for the case where there is one atom per unit cell. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures the integrated quantum metric exclusively. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free-fermions, we unveil a remarkable connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for Scaling Dimensions of Composite Operators in the $\phi^4$ Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit. We further generalize our results to the $\displaystyle{\left(\vec{\phi} \cdot \vec{\phi}\right)^{n/2}}$ operators in the $O(N)$ model.</description>
