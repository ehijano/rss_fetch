      <title>Failure to track a stable AMOC state under rapid climate change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a tipping element of the climate system. The current estimate of the global warming threshold for the onset of an AMOC collapse is +4C. However, such a threshold may not be meaningful because AMOC stability depends on the rate of radiative forcing and background climate state. Here, we identify an AMOC stabilising mechanism that operates on timescales longer than present-day radiative forcing increase. Slow forcing permits coherent adjustment of surface and interior ocean properties, supported by enhanced evaporation and reduced sea-ice extent, counteracting destabilising feedbacks. This mechanism is explicitly demonstrated in a slow CO2 increase experiment (+0.5 ppm/yr), in which the AMOC remains stable up to +5.5C of global warming. By contrast, under intermediate- and high-emission scenarios, the AMOC collapses at substantially lower warming levels (+2.2C and +2.8C, respectively). Our findings demonstrate the strong radiative forcing path dependence of AMOC tipping and imply that limiting the rate of radiative forcing is critical for reducing the near-term risk of an AMOC collapse.</description>

      <title>UniPhy: Unifying Riemannian-Clifford Geometry and Biorthogonal Dynamics for Planetary-Scale Continuous Weather Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While data-driven weather models have achieved remarkable deterministic accuracy, they fundamentally rely on discrete-time mappings and closed-system assumptions, failing to capture the multi-scale continuous dynamics and thermodynamic openness of the atmosphere. To address these limitations, we propose UniPhy, a continuous-time non-Hermitian neural stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) solver. Geometrically, we employ Riemannian-Clifford gauge transformations to flatten planetary heterogeneity, enabling globally consistent operations. Dynamically, we construct non-Hermitian biorthogonal spectral operators integrated with a global flux tracker to capture transient energy growth and open-system exchange. Computationally, by identifying the algebraic associativity of the analytic solution, we reformulate adaptive physical integration as a parallel prefix-sum problem, achieving log-linear sequence parallelism. UniPhy establishes a physically complete foundation model architecture that unifies geometric adaptivity, thermodynamic consistency, and computational efficiency. Our code is available at &lt;https://github.com/yrqUni/UniPhy&gt;.</description>

      <title>Confinement results near point vortices on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Euler equation on the rotating sphere in the case where the absolute vorticity is initially sharply concentrated around several points. We follow the literature already concerning vorticity confinement for the planar Euler equations, and obtain similar results on the rotating sphere, with new challenges due to the geometry. More precisely, we show the improbability of collisions for point-vortices, logarithmic in time absolute vorticity confinement for general configurations, the optimality of this last result in general, and the existence of configurations with power-law long confinement. We take this opportunity to write a unified, self-contained, and improved version of all the proofs, previously scattered across multiple papers on the planar case, with detailed exposition for pedagogical clarity.</description>
