      <title>Investigating dynamics and asymptotic trend to equilibrium in a reactive BGK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate numerically a recent BGK-type model for a multi-component mixture of monatomic gases, undergoing a reversible bimolecular chemical reaction. The model replaces each collisional term of the Boltzmann equation with a relaxation term, thereby describing separately the effects of the mechanical processes and the chemical reaction. Additionally, the model exhibits consistency properties. The correct entropy production is ensured when auxiliary temperatures in the chemical contributions share a common value. We assume isotropic distributions and perform numerical simulations for the macroscopic fields to appraise how the dynamics push the mixture toward thermalization and chemical equilibrium. We show that the hypothesis on the equalization of fictitious species temperatures is justifiable to ensure the monotonicity of the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional. Simulations show that, when initial temperatures are far from equilibrium, the relaxation towards equilibrium occurs at a later stage and the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional is not monotone during the initial transient.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Synchronization with Continuous Varying Exponent in Decentralized Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the decentralized power grid, we consider a synchronization transition (ST) of the Kuramoto model (KM) with a mixture of first- and second-order type oscillators with fractions $p$ and $1-p$, respectively. Discontinuous ST with forward-backward hysteresis is found in the mean-field limit. A critical exponent $\beta$ is noticed in the spinodal drop of the order parameter curve at the backward ST. We find critical damping inertia $m_*(p)$ of the oscillator mixture, where the system undergoes a characteristic change from overdamped to underdamped. When underdamped, the hysteretic area also becomes multistable. This contrasts an overdamped system, which is bistable at hysteresis. We also notice that $\beta(p)$ continuously varies with $p$ along the critical damping line $m_*(p)$. Further, we find a single-cluster to multi-cluster phase transition at $m_{**}(p)$. We also discuss the effect of those features on the stability of the power grid, which is increasingly threatened as more electric power is produced from inertia-free generators.</description>

      <title>Causal Leverage Density: A General Approach to Semantic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce a new approach to semantic information based upon the influence of erasure operations (interventions) upon distributions of a system's future trajectories through its phase space. Semantic (meaningful) information is distinguished from syntactic information by the property of having some intrinsic causal power on the future of a given system. As Shannon famously stated, syntactic information is a simple property of probability distributions (the elementary Shannon expression), or correlations between two subsystems and thus does not tell us anything about the meaning of a given message. Kolchinsky &amp; Wolpert (2018) introduced a powerful framework for computing semantic information, which employs interventions upon the state of a system (either initial or dynamic) to erase syntactic information that might influence the viability of a subsystem (such as an organism in an environment). In this work I adapt this framework such that rather than using the viability of a subsystem, we simply observe the changes in future trajectories through a system's phase space as a result of informational interventions (erasures or scrambling). This allows for a more general formalisation of semantic information that does not assume a primary role for the viability of a subsystem (to use examples from Kolchinsky &amp; Wolpert (2018), a rock, a hurricane, or a cell). Many systems of interest have a semantic component, such as a neural network, but may not have such an intrinsic connection to viability as living organisms or dissipative structures. Hence this simple approach to semantic information could be applied to any living, non-living or technological system in order to quantify whether a given quantity of syntactic information within it also has semantic or causal power.</description>

      <title>On the origin of escort distributions for q-entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an argument about the origin of escort distributions used in conjunction with the q-entropy in non-additive thermo-statistics. The origin of the escort distributions is ascribed to the fact that the effective statistical description of the underlying system is provided by the measured Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of manifolds having a warped product metric structure. We interpret the entropic parameter \ q \ appearing in escort distributions as a "dimension" related to the fibration structure of the underlying phase spaces.</description>

      <title>Hamilton's equations for relaxation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation function is the cornerstone to perform calculations in weakly driven processes. Properties that such a function should obey are already established, but the difficulty in its calculation is still an issue to be overcome. In this work, I proposed a new method to determine such a function for thermally isolated systems, based on a Hamilton's equations approach. Observing that the microscopic relaxation function can be turned into a canonical variable, one can choose the initial conditions of the solutions of Hamilton's equations to avoid the calculation of the average in the initial canonical ensemble. The unbearable example of the quartic oscillator is solved to corroborate the method. Extensions to the quantum realm and stochastic thermodynamics are mandatory.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Langevin functionals for a driven probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a probe particle immersed in a fluid with nonlinear interactions is subject to strong driving, the cumulants of the stochastic force acting on the probe are nonlinear functionals of the driving protocol. We present a Volterra series for these nonlinear functionals, by applying nonlinear response theory in a path integral formalism, where the emerging kernels are shown to be expressed in terms of connected equilibrium correlation functions. The first cumulant is the mean force, the second cumulant characterizes the non-equilibrium force fluctuations (noise), and higher order cumulants quantify non-Gaussian fluctuations. We discuss the interpretation of this formalism in relation to Langevin dynamics. We highlight two example scenarios of this formalism: i) For a particle driven with prescribed trajectory, the formalism yields the non-equilibrium statistics of the interaction force with the fluid. ii) For a particle confined in a moving trapping potential, the formalism yields the non-equilibrium statistics of the trapping force. In simulations of a model of nonlinearly interacting Brownian particles, we find that nonlinear phenomena, such as shear-thinning and oscillating noise covariance, appear in third or second order response, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spectral Statistics, Hydrodynamics and Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central problems in many-body physics, both classical and quantum, is the relations between different notions of chaos. Ergodicity, mixing, operator growth, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and spectral chaos are defined in terms of completely different objects in different contexts, don't necessarily co-occur, but still seem to be manifestations of closely related phenomena. In this dissertation, we study the relation between two notions of chaos: thermalization and spectral chaos. We define a quantity called the Total Return Probability (TRP) which measures how a system forgets its initial state after time $T$, and show that it is closely connected to the Spectral Form Factor (SFF), a measure of chaos deriving from the energy level spectrum of a quantum system. The main thrust of this work concerns hydrodynamic systems -- systems where locality prevents charge or energy from spreading quickly, this putting a throttle on thermalization. We show that the detailed spacings of energy levels closely capture the dynamics of these locally conserved charges. We also study spin glasses, a phase of matter where the obstacle to thermalization comes not from locality but from the presence of too many neighbors. Changing one region requires changing nearby regions which requires changing nearby-to-nearby regions, until only catastrophic realignments of the whole system can fully explore phase space. In spin glasses we find our clearest analytic link between thermalization and spectral statistics. We analytically calculate the spectral form factor in the limit of large system size and show it is equal to the TRP. Finally, in the conclusion, we discuss some ideas for the future of both the SFF and the TRP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized equipartition theorem known as the conjugate variables theorem (Phys. Rev. E 86, 051136 [2012]), originally obtained in the context of statistical inference of continuous random variables, is extended in this work to the case of discrete variables. Using this new set of theorems we derive novel thermodynamic identities for the canonical ensemble connecting temperature with measurable observables.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal signatures in the scaling functions of critical variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The view that the probability density function (PDF) of a key statistical variable, anomalously scaled by size or time, could furnish a hallmark of universal behavior contrasts with the circumstance that such density sensibly depends on non-universal features. We solve this apparent contradiction by demonstrating that both non-universal amplitudes and universal exponents of leading critical singularities in large deviation functions are determined by the PDF tails, whose form is argued on extensivity. This unexplored scenario implies a universal form of central limit theorem at criticality and is confirmed by exact calculations for mean field Ising models in equilibrium and for anomalous diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signatures of discontinuous phase transitions: How phase coexistence determines exponential versus power-law scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the finite-size scaling of the Liouvillian gap and dynamical fluctuations at discontinuous phase transitions, with various studies reporting either exponential or power-law behavior. We clarify this issue by employing large deviation theory. We distinguish two distinct classes of discontinuous phase transitions that have different dynamical properties. The first class is associated with phase coexistence, i.e., the presence of multiple stable attractors of the system dynamics (e.g., local minima of the free energy functional) in a finite phase diagram region around the phase transition point. In that case, one observes asymptotic exponential scaling related to stochastic switching between attractors (though the onset of exponential scaling may sometimes occur for very large system sizes). In the second class, there is no phase coexistence away from the phase transition point, while at the phase transition point itself there are infinitely many attractors. In that case, one observes power-law scaling related to the diffusive nature of the system relaxation to the stationary state.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of transfer learning in fully-connected networks in the proportional limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) is a well-established machine learning technique to boost the generalization performance on a specific (target) task using information gained from a related (source) task, and it crucially depends on the ability of a network to learn useful features. Leveraging recent analytical progress in the proportional regime of deep learning theory (i.e. the limit where the size of the training set $P$ and the size of the hidden layers $N$ are taken to infinity keeping their ratio $\alpha = P/N$ finite), in this work we develop a novel single-instance Franz-Parisi formalism that yields an effective theory for TL in fully-connected neural networks. Unlike the (lazy-training) infinite-width limit, where TL is ineffective, we demonstrate that in the proportional limit TL occurs due to a renormalized source-target kernel that quantifies their relatedness and determines whether TL is beneficial for generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transition between N\'eel and columnar valence-bond solid ordering in two-dimensional $S=3/2$ square lattice quantum antiferromagnets with SO(3) symmetry. According to the deconfined criticality scenario, this transition can be direct and continuous like the well-studied $S=1/2$ case. To study the global phase diagram, we work with four multi-spin couplings with full rotational symmetry, that are free of the sign-problem of quantum Monte Carlo. Exploring the phase diagram with quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the phase transition between N\'eel and valence-bond solid is strongly first-order in the parts of the phase diagram that we have accessed.</description>

      <title>Hole Statistics of Equilibrium 2D and 3D Hard-Sphere Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probability of finding a spherical "hole" of a given radius $r$ contains crucial structural information about many-body systems. Such hole statistics, including the void conditional nearest-neighbor probability functions $G_V(r)$, have been well studied for hard-sphere fluids in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. However, little is known about these functions for hard-sphere crystals for values of $r$ beyond the hard-sphere diameter, as large holes are extremely rare in crystal phases. To overcome these computational challenges, we introduce a biased-sampling scheme that accurately determines hole statistics for equilibrium hard spheres on ranges of $r$ that far extend those that could be previously explored. We discover that $G_V(r)$ in crystal and hexatic states exhibits oscillations whose amplitudes increase rapidly with the packing fraction, which stands in contrast to $G_V(r)$ for fluid states that is monotonic in $r$. The oscillations in $G_V(r)$ for 2D crystals are strongly correlated with the local orientational order metric in the vicinity of the holes, and variations in $G_V(r)$ for 3D states indicate a transition between tetrahedral and octahedral holes, demonstrating the power of $G_V(r)$ as a probe of local coordination geometry. To further study the statistics of interparticle spacing in hard-sphere systems, we compute the local packing fraction distribution $f(\phi_l)$ of Delaunay cells, and find that for $d\leq 3$, the excess kurtosis of $f(\phi_l)$ switches sign at a certain transitional global packing fraction. Our investigation facilitates the study of structural and bulk properties of materials that involve the creation of rare large holes, such as the solubility of alloys.</description>

      <title>Krylov fractality and complexity in generic random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov space methods provide an efficient framework for analyzing the dynamical aspects of quantum systems, with tridiagonal matrices playing a key role. Despite their importance, the behavior of such matrices from chaotic to integrable states, transitioning through an intermediate phase, remains unexplored. We aim to fill this gap by considering the properties of the tridiagonal matrix elements and the associated basis vectors for appropriate random matrix ensembles. We utilize the Rosenzweig-Porter model as our primary example, which hosts a fractal regime in addition to the ergodic and localized phases. We discuss the characteristics of the matrix elements and basis vectors across the three (ergodic, fractal, and localized) regimes and introduce tools to identify the transition points. The exact expressions of the Lanczos coefficients are provided in terms of $q$-logarithmic function across the full parameter regime. The numerical results are corroborated with analytical reasoning for certain features of the Krylov spectra. Additionally, we investigate the Krylov state complexity within these regimes, showcasing the efficacy of our methods in pinpointing these transitions.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on discrete topologies: from networks to higher-order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nature is a blossoming of regular structures, signature of self-organization of the underlying microscopic interacting agents. Turing theory of pattern formation is one of the most studied mechanisms to address such phenomena and has been applied to a widespread gallery of disciplines. Turing himself used a spatial discretization of the hosting support to eventually deal with a set of ODEs. Such an idea contained the seeds of the theory on discrete support, which has been fully acknowledged with the birth of network science in the early 2000s. This approach allows us to tackle several settings not displaying a trivial continuous embedding, such as multiplex, temporal networks, and, recently, higher-order structures. This line of research has been mostly confined within the network science community, despite its inherent potential to transcend the conventional boundaries of the PDE-based approach to Turing patterns. Moreover, network topology allows for novel dynamics to be generated via a universal formalism that can be readily extended to account for higher-order structures. The interplay between continuous and discrete settings can pave the way for further developments in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian subject to stochastic perturbations in its anti-Hermitian part, describing fluctuating gains and losses. The master equation governing the noise-average dynamics describes a new form of dephasing. We characterize the resulting state evolution and analyze its purity. The novel properties of such dynamics are illustrated in a stochastic dissipative qubit. Our analytical results show that adding noise allows for a rich control of the dynamics, with a greater diversity of steady states and the possibility of state purification.</description>

Such mixtures, of varying non-zero activity, remain largely unexplored even though they are relevant for a plethora of systems and applications ranging from cellular biophysics to drone swarms. Our mixtures are modulated by their activity ratios ($\mathrm{Pe}^\mathrm{R}$), which we find to encode information by giving rise to three regimes, each of which display their unique emergent behaviors. Specifically, we found non-monotonic behavior of macroscopic properties, e.g. density and pressure, as a function of activity ratio, microphase separation of fast and slow particle domains, increased fluctuations on the interface and severe avalanche events compared to monodisperse active systems. Our approach of simultaneously varying the two activities of the particle species allowed us to discover these behaviors and explain the microscopic physical mechanisms that drive them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the six-vertex model at its free-fermion point with domain wall boundary conditions, which is equivalent to random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. We compute the scaling limit of a particular non-local correlation function, essentially equivalent to the partition function for the domino tilings of a pentagon-shaped domain, obtained by cutting away a triangular region from a corner of the initial Aztec diamond. We observe a third-order phase transition when the geometric parameters of the obtained pentagonal domain are tuned to have the fifth side exactly tangent to the arctic ellipse of the corresponding initial model.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics in decohered quantum memory with repeated syndrome measurements: a dual approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements can detect errors in a decohered quantum memory allowing active error correction to increase the memory time. Previous understanding of this mechanism has focused on evaluating the performance of error correction algorithms based on measurement results. In this work, we instead intrinsically characterize the information dynamics in a quantum memory under repeated measurements, using coherent information and relative entropy. We consider the dynamics of a $d$-dimensional stabilizer code subject to Pauli errors and noisy stabilizer measurements and develop a $(d+1)$-dimensional statistical mechanics model for the information-theoretic diagnostics. Our model is dual to the model previously obtained for the optimal decoding algorithm, and the potential decoding transition in the quantum memory again manifests as a thermal phase transition in the statistical mechanics model. We explicitly derive the model and study the phase transition in information encoding in three examples: surface codes, repetition codes, and the XZZX code.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm to Prepare Quasi-Stationary States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics can be analyzed via the structure of energy eigenstates. However, in the many-body setting, preparing eigenstates associated with finite temperatures requires time scaling exponentially with system size. In this work we present an efficient quantum search algorithm which produces quasi-stationary states, having energies supported within narrow windows of a dense many-body spectrum. In time scaling polynomially with system size, the algorithm produces states with inverse polynomial energy width, which can in turn be used to analyze many-body dynamics out to polynomial times. The algorithm is based on quantum singular value transformations and quantum signal processing, and provides a quadratic speedup over measurement-based approaches. We discuss how this algorithm can be used as a primitive to investigate the mechanisms underlying thermalization and hydrodynamics in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Boltzmann's H-function for Particles with Orientational Degrees of Freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boltzmann's H-function H(t) holds a venerable place in the history of science. However, it seems never to have been evaluated for particles with orientational degrees of freedom. We generalize Boltzmann's H-function to a gas of molecules that can both rotate and translate and on collision exchange both momentum and angular momentum, obeying conservation laws. We evaluate the time (t) evolution of single-particle joint probability distribution f (p, L, t) for linear (p) and angular (L) momenta from an initial nonequilibrium state by molecular dynamics simulations. We consider both prolate and oblate-shaped particles, interacting by well-known Gay-Berne potential that depends both on position and orientation vectors. We calculate the relaxation of the generalized molecular H(t) from several initial (t=0) nonequilibrium states. In the long-time limit, the H function saturates to its exact equilibrium value, which is the sum of translational and rotational contributions to the respective entropies. Both the translational and rotational components of H(t) decay nearly exponentially with time; the rotational component is more sensitive to the molecular shape that enters through the aspect ratio. A remarkable rapid decrease in the rotational relaxation time is observed as the spherical limit is approached, in a way tantalizingly reminiscent of Hu-Zwanzig hydrodynamic prediction with slip boundary condition. Additionally, we obtain H(t) analytically by solving the appropriate translational and rotational Fokker-Planck equation and obtain a modest agreement with simulations. We observe a remarkable signature of translation-rotation coupling as a function of molecular shape, captured through a physically meaningful differential term that quantifies the magnitude of translation-rotation coupling.</description>

Abstract: The speed of an exhaustive search can be measured by a cover time, which is defined as the time it takes a random searcher to visit every state in some target set. Cover times have been studied in both the physics and probability literatures, with most prior works focusing on a single searcher. In this paper, we prove an explicit formula for all the moments of the cover time for many searchers on an arbitrary discrete network. Our results show that such cover times depend only on properties of the network along the shortest paths to the most distant parts of the target. This mere local dependence contrasts with the well-known result that cover times for single searchers depend on global properties of the network. We illustrate our rigorous results by stochastic simulations.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate experimentally that, applying optimal protocols which drive the system between two equilibrium states characterized by a free energy difference $\Delta F$, we can maximize the probability of performing the transition between the two states with a work $W$ smaller than $\Delta F$. The second law holds only on average, resulting in the inequality $\langle W \rangle \geq \Delta F$. The experiment is performed using an underdamped oscillator evolving in a double-well potential. We show that with a suitable choice of parameters the probability of obtaining trajectories with $W \le \Delta F$ can be larger than 95%. Very fast protocols are a key feature to obtain these results, which are explained in terms of the Jarzynski equality.</description>

      <title>Constrained hidden Markov models reveal further Hsp90 protein states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series of conformational dynamics in proteins are usually evaluated with hidden Markov models (HMMs). This approach works well if the number of states and their connectivity is known. However, for the multi-domain protein Hsp90, a standard HMM analysis with optimization of the BIC (Bayesian information criterion) cannot explain long-lived states well. Therefore, here we employ constrained hidden Markov models, which neglect transitions between states by including assumptions. Gradually tuning a model with justified and focused changes allows us to improve its effectiveness and the score of the BIC. This became possible by analyzing time traces with several thousand observable transitions and, therefore, superb statistics. In this scheme, we also monitor the residences in the states reconstructed by the model, aiming to find exponentially distributed dwell times. We show how introducing new states can achieve these statistics but also point out limitations, e.g., for substantial similarity of two states connected to a common neighbor. One of the states displays the lowest free energy and could be the idle open "waiting state", in which Hsp90 waits for the binding of nucleotides, cochaperones, or clients.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Brownian motion with dependent components: turning angle analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion assume that each component is independent. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Cover times of many diffusive or subdiffusive searchers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cover times measure the speed of exhaustive searches which require the exploration of an entire spatial region(s). Applications include the immune system hunting pathogens, animals collecting food, robotic demining or cleaning, and computer search algorithms. Mathematically, a cover time is the first time a random searcher(s) comes within a specified "detection radius" of every point in the target region (often the entire spatial domain). Due to their many applications and their fundamental probabilistic importance, cover times have been extensively studied in the physics and probability literatures. This prior work has generally studied cover times of a single searcher with a vanishing detection radius or a large target region. This prior work has further claimed that cover times for multiple searchers can be estimated by a simple rescaling of the cover time of a single searcher. In this paper, we study cover times of many diffusive or subdiffusive searchers and show that prior estimates break down as the number of searchers grows. We prove a rather universal formula for all the moments of such cover times in the many searcher limit that depends only on (i) the searcher's characteristic (sub)diffusivity and (ii) a certain geodesic distance between the searcher starting location(s) and the farthest point in the target. This formula is otherwise independent of the detection radius, space dimension, target size, and domain size. We illustrate our results in several examples and compare them to detailed stochastic simulations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking digital quantum simulations above hundreds of qubits using quantum critical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real-time simulation of large many-body quantum systems is a formidable task, that may only be achievable with a genuine quantum computational platform. Currently, quantum hardware with a number of qubits sufficient to make classical emulation challenging is available. This condition is necessary for the pursuit of a so-called quantum advantage, but it also makes verifying the results very difficult. In this manuscript, we flip the perspective and utilize known theoretical results about many-body quantum critical dynamics to benchmark quantum hardware and various error mitigation techniques on up to 133 qubits. In particular, we benchmark against known universal scaling laws in the Hamiltonian simulation of a time-dependent transverse field Ising Hamiltonian. Incorporating only basic error mitigation and suppression methods, our study shows reliable control up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring a maximum of 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. These results are transferable to applications such as Hamiltonian simulation, variational algorithms, optimization, or quantum machine learning. We demonstrate this on the example of digitized quantum annealing for optimization and identify an optimal working point in terms of both circuit depth and time step on a 133-site optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Finite-size spectrum of the staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The finite-size spectrum of the critical staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions is studied. Similar to the case of periodic boundary conditions, we identify three different phases. In two of those, the underlying conformal field theory can be identified to be related to the twisted $U(1)$ Kac-Moody algebra. In contrast, the finite size scaling in the third regime, whose critical behaviour with the (quasi-)periodic BCs is related to the 2d black hole CFTs possessing a non-compact degree of freedom, is more subtle. Here with antidiagonal BCs imposed, the corrections to the scaling of the ground state grow logarithmically with the system size, while the energy gaps appear to close logarithmically. Moreover, we obtain an explicit formula for the Q-operator which is useful for numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Edge Spin fractionalization in one-dimensional spin-$S$ quantum antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a gapped spin-$S$ chain with antiferromagnetic (AFM) order exhibits in the thermodynamic limit exponentially localized fractional $\pm \frac{S}{2}$ edge modes when the system possesses U(1) symmetry. We show this for integrable and non integrable spin chains both analytically and numerically. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that an AFM spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain with {\it explicitly} broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and an integrable AFM spin-$1$ chain with {\it spontaneously} broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry have $\pm \frac{1}{4}$ and $\pm \frac{1}{2}$ fractionalized edge modes, respectively. Furthermore, employing the density matrix renormalization group technique, we extend this analysis to {\it generic} $XXZ-S$ chains with $S\leq 3$ and demonstrate that these fractional spins are robust quantum observables, substantiated by the observation of a variance of the associated fractional spin operators that is consistent with a vanishing functional form in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we find that the edge modes are robust to disorder that couples to the N\'eel order parameter.</description>
