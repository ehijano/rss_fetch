      <title>Small-Signal Dynamics of Lossy Inverter-Based Microgrids for Generalized Droop Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A network-level small-signal model is developed for lossy microgrids, which considers coupled angle and voltage dynamics of inverter-based microgrids and uses a more general framework of droop controls in the inverter. It is shown that when relative resistances of the lines in the microgrid are reasonably consistent and differences of voltage angles across the lines are small at the operating point, the generalized droop controls can be designed to enforce decoupling between angle dynamics and voltage dynamics. Next, structural results for the asymptotic stability of small-signal angle and voltage dynamics are given for the case when generalized droop control achieves decoupling. Simulated transient responses of a modified IEEE 9-bus system are presented to validate the theoretical findings which show the effectiveness of generalized droop controls in independently shaping the settling times of the angle and voltage responses of the lossy microgrid system.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Kalman Filtering based on Self-Attention Mechanism and Lattice Trajectory Piecewise Linear Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional Kalman filter (KF) is widely applied in control systems, but it relies heavily on the accuracy of the system model and noise parameters, leading to potential performance degradation when facing inaccuracies. To address this issue, introducing neural networks into the KF framework offers a data-driven solution to compensate for these inaccuracies, improving the filter's performance while maintaining interpretability. Nevertheless, existing studies mostly employ recurrent neural network (RNN), which fails to fully capture the dependencies among state sequences and lead to an unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm named the attention Kalman filter (AtKF), which incorporates a self-attention network to capture the dependencies among state sequences. To address the instability in the recursive training process, a parallel pre-training strategy is devised. Specifically, this strategy involves piecewise linearizing the system via lattice trajectory piecewise linear (LTPWL) expression, and generating pre-training data through a batch estimation algorithm, which exploits the self-attention mechanism's parallel processing ability. Experimental results on a two-dimensional nonlinear system demonstrate that AtKF outperforms other filters under noise disturbances and model mismatches.</description>

      <title>Cycle Life Prediction for Lithium-ion Batteries: Machine Learning and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batteries are dynamic systems with complicated nonlinear aging, highly dependent on cell design, chemistry, manufacturing, and operational conditions. Prediction of battery cycle life and estimation of aging states is important to accelerate battery R&amp;D, testing, and to further the understanding of how batteries degrade. Beyond testing, battery management systems rely on real-time models and onboard diagnostics and prognostics for safe operation. Estimating the state of health and remaining useful life of a battery is important to optimize performance and use resources optimally.
  This tutorial begins with an overview of first-principles, machine learning, and hybrid battery models. Then, a typical pipeline for the development of interpretable machine learning models is explained and showcased for cycle life prediction from laboratory testing data. We highlight the challenges of machine learning models, motivating the incorporation of physics in hybrid modeling approaches, which are needed to decipher the aging trajectory of batteries but require more data and further work on the physics of battery degradation. The tutorial closes with a discussion on generalization and further research directions.</description>

      <title>Queue-aware Network Control Algorithm with a High Quantum Computing Readiness-Evaluated in Discrete-time Flow Simulator for Fat-Pipe Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging technology of quantum computing has the potential to change the way how problems will be solved in the future. This work presents a centralized network control algorithm executable on already existing quantum computer which are based on the principle of quantum annealing like the D-Wave Advantage. We introduce a resource reoccupation algorithm for traffic engineering in wide-area networks. The proposed optimization algorithm changes traffic steering and resource allocation in case of overloaded transceivers. Settings of active components like fiber amplifiers and transceivers are not changed for the reason of stability. This algorithm is beneficial in situations when the network traffic is fluctuating in time scales of seconds or spontaneous bursts occur. Further, we developed a discrete-time flow simulator to study the algorithm's performance in wide-area networks. Our network simulator considers backlog and loss modeling of buffered transmission lines. Concurring flows are handled equally in case of a backlog.
  This work provides an ILP-based network configuring algorithm that is applicable on quantum annealing computers. We showcase, that traffic losses can be reduced significantly by a factor of 2 if a resource reoccupation algorithm is applied in a network with bursty traffic. As resources are used more efficiently by reoccupation in heavy load situations, overprovisioning of networks can be reduced. Thus, this new form of network operation leads toward a zero-margin network. We show that our newly introduced network simulator enables analyses of short-time effects like buffering within fat-pipe networks. As the calculation of network configurations in real-sized networks is typically time-consuming, quantum computing can enable the proposed network configuration algorithm for application in real-sized wide-area networks.</description>

      <title>Field Teams Coordination for Earthquake-Damaged Distribution System Energization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The re-energization of electrical distribution systems in a post-disaster scenario is of grave importance as most modern infrastructure systems rely heavily on the presence of electricity. This paper introduces a method to coordinate the field teams for the optimal energization of an electrical distribution system after an earthquake-induced blackout. The proposed method utilizes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to create an optimal energization strategy, which aims to minimize the expected time to energize each distribution system component. The travel duration of each team and the possible outcomes of the energization attempts are considered in the state transitions. The failure probabilities of the system components are computed using the fragility curves of structures and the Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values which are encoded to the MDP model via transition probabilities. Furthermore, the proposed solution offers several methods to determine the non-optimal actions during the construction of the MDP and eliminate them in order to improve the run-time performance without sacrificing the optimality of the solution.</description>

      <title>Torque-Minimizing Control Allocation for Overactuated Quadrupedal Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve upon a method for optimal control of quadrupedal robots which utilizes a full-order model of the system. The original method utilizes offline nonlinear optimal control to synthesize a control scheme which exponentially orbitally stabilizes the closed-loop system. However, it is not able to handle the overactuated phases which frequently occur during quadrupedal locomotion as a result of the multi-contact nature of the system. We propose a modified method, which handles overactuated gait phases in a way that utilizes the full range of available actuators to minimize torque expenditure without requiring output trajectories to be modified. It is shown that the system under the proposed controller exhibits the same properties, i.e. exponential orbital stability, with the same or lower point-wise torque magnitude. A simulation study demonstrates that the reduction in torque may in certain cases be substantial.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Adaptive Model Predictive Control Using the Circle and Tsypkin Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absolute stability is a technique for analyzing the stability of Lur'e systems, which arise in diverse applications, such as oscillators with nonlinear damping or nonlinear stiffness. A special class of Lur'e systems consists of self-excited systems (SES), in which bounded oscillations arise from constant inputs. In many cases, SES can be stabilized by linear controllers, which motivates the present work, where the goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive model predictive control for Lur'e systems. In particular, the present paper considers predictive cost adaptive control (PCAC), which is equivalent to a linear, time-variant (LTV) controller. A closed-loop Lur'e system comprised of the positive feedback interconnection of the Lur'e system and the PCAC-based controller can thus be derived at each step. In this work, the circle and Tsypkin criteria are used to evaluate the absolute stability of the closed-loop Lur'e system, where the adaptive controller is viewed as instantaneously linear time-invariant. When the controller converges, the absolute stability criteria guarantee global asymptotic stability of the asymptotic closed-loop dynamics.</description>

      <title>Convex MPC and Thrust Allocation with Deadband for Spacecraft Rendezvous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into a rendezvous scenario involving a chaser and a target spacecraft, focusing on the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to design a controller capable of guiding the chaser toward the target. The operational principle of spacecraft thrusters, requiring a minimum activation time that leads to the existence of a control deadband, introduces mixed-integer constraints into the optimization, posing a considerable computational challenge due to the exponential complexity on the number of integer constraints. We address this complexity by presenting two solver algorithms that efficiently approximate the optimal solution in significantly less time than standard solvers, making them well-suited for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Model-Predictive Trajectory Generation for Autonomous Aerial Search and Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the trajectory planning problem for search and coverage missions with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The objective is to devise optimal coverage trajectories based on a utility map describing prior region information, assumed to be effectively approximated by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We introduce a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm employing a relaxed formulation that promotes the exploration of the map by preventing the UAV from revisiting previously covered areas. This is achieved by penalizing intersections between the UAV's visibility regions along its trajectory. The algorithm is assessed in MATLAB and validated in Gazebo, as well as in outdoor experimental tests. The results show that the proposed strategy can generate efficient and smooth trajectories for search and coverage missions.</description>

      <title>Heat Death of Generative Models in Closed-Loop Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improvement and adoption of generative machine learning models is rapidly accelerating, as exemplified by the popularity of LLMs (Large Language Models) for text, and diffusion models for image generation.As generative models become widespread, data they generate is incorporated into shared content through the public web. This opens the question of what happens when data generated by a model is fed back to the model in subsequent training campaigns. This is a question about the stability of the training process, whether the distribution of publicly accessible content, which we refer to as "knowledge", remains stable or collapses.
  Small scale empirical experiments reported in the literature show that this closed-loop training process is prone to degenerating. Models may start producing gibberish data, or sample from only a small subset of the desired data distribution (a phenomenon referred to as mode collapse). So far there has been only limited theoretical understanding of this process, in part due to the complexity of the deep networks underlying these generative models.
  The aim of this paper is to provide insights into this process (that we refer to as "generative closed-loop learning") by studying the learning dynamics of generative models that are fed back their own produced content in addition to their original training dataset. The sampling of many of these models can be controlled via a "temperature" parameter. Using dynamical systems tools, we show that, unless a sufficient amount of external data is introduced at each iteration, any non-trivial temperature leads the model to asymptotically degenerate. In fact, either the generative distribution collapses to a small set of outputs, or becomes uniform over a large set of outputs.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Gaussian Process Learning-based Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to Gaussian process learning-based model predictive control (GP-MPC), an advanced approach integrating Gaussian process (GP) with model predictive control (MPC) for enhanced control in complex systems. It begins with GP regression fundamentals, illustrating how it enriches MPC with enhanced predictive accuracy and robust handling of uncertainties. A central contribution of this tutorial is the first detailed, systematic mathematical formulation of GP-MPC in literature, focusing on deriving the approximation of means and variances propagation for GP multi-step predictions. Practical applications in robotics control, such as path-following for mobile robots in challenging terrains and mixed-vehicle platooning, are discussed to demonstrate the real-world effectiveness and adaptability of GP-MPC. This tutorial aims to make GP-MPC accessible to researchers and practitioners, enriching the learning-based control field with in-depth theoretical and practical insights and fostering further innovations in complex system control.</description>

      <title>Legible and Proactive Robot Planning for Prosocial Human-Robot Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to fluently engage in joint collision avoidance in crowded navigation tasks despite the complexities and uncertainties inherent in human behavior. Underlying these interactions is a mutual understanding that (i) individuals are prosocial, that is, there is equitable responsibility in avoiding collisions, and (ii) individuals should behave legibly, that is, move in a way that clearly conveys their intent to reduce ambiguity in how they intend to avoid others. Toward building robots that can safely and seamlessly interact with humans, we propose a general robot trajectory planning framework for synthesizing legible and proactive behaviors and demonstrate that our robot planner naturally leads to prosocial interactions. Specifically, we introduce the notion of a markup factor to incentivize legible and proactive behaviors and an inconvenience budget constraint to ensure equitable collision avoidance responsibility. We evaluate our approach against well-established multi-agent planning algorithms and show that using our approach produces safe, fluent, and prosocial interactions. We demonstrate the real-time feasibility of our approach with human-in-the-loop simulations. Project page can be found at https://uw-ctrl.github.io/phri/.</description>

      <title>Randomized Greedy Methods for Weak Submodular Sensor Selection with Robustness Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a pair of budget- and performance-constrained weak submodular maximization problems. For computational efficiency, we explore the use of stochastic greedy algorithms which limit the search space via random sampling instead of the standard greedy procedure which explores the entire feasible search space. We propose a pair of stochastic greedy algorithms, namely, Modified Randomized Greedy (MRG) and Dual Randomized Greedy (DRG) to approximately solve the budget- and performance-constrained problems, respectively. For both algorithms, we derive approximation guarantees that hold with high probability. We then examine the use of DRG in robust optimization problems wherein the objective is to maximize the worst-case of a number of weak submodular objectives and propose the Randomized Weak Submodular Saturation Algorithm (Random-WSSA). We further derive a high-probability guarantee for when Random-WSSA successfully constructs a robust solution. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of these algorithms in a variety of relevant uses within the context of Earth-observing LEO constellations which estimate atmospheric weather conditions and provide Earth coverage.</description>

      <title>On Extending the Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML) for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the urgent need for messaging standards in the operational test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of machine learning (ML) applications, particularly in edge ML applications embedded in systems like robots, satellites, and unmanned vehicles. It examines the suitability of the IEEE Standard 1671 (IEEE Std 1671), known as the Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML), an XML-based standard originally developed for electronic systems, for ML application testing. The paper explores extending IEEE Std 1671 to encompass the unique challenges of ML applications, including the use of datasets and dependencies on software. Through modeling various tests such as adversarial robustness and drift detection, this paper offers a framework adaptable to specific applications, suggesting that minor modifications to ATML might suffice to address the novelties of ML. This paper differentiates ATML's focus on testing from other ML standards like Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) or Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), which concentrate on ML model specification. We conclude that ATML is a promising tool for effective, near real-time operational T&amp;E of ML applications, an essential aspect of AI lifecycle management, safety, and governance.</description>

      <title>A Systems Theoretic Approach to Online Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The machine learning formulation of online learning is incomplete from a systems theoretic perspective. Typically, machine learning research emphasizes domains and tasks, and a problem solving worldview. It focuses on algorithm parameters, features, and samples, and neglects the perspective offered by considering system structure and system behavior or dynamics. Online learning is an active field of research and has been widely explored in terms of statistical theory and computational algorithms, however, in general, the literature still lacks formal system theoretical frameworks for modeling online learning systems and resolving systems-related concept drift issues. Furthermore, while the machine learning formulation serves to classify methods and literature, the systems theoretic formulation presented herein serves to provide a framework for the top-down design of online learning systems, including a novel definition of online learning and the identification of key design parameters. The framework is formulated in terms of input-output systems and is further divided into system structure and system behavior. Concept drift is a critical challenge faced in online learning, and this work formally approaches it as part of the system behavior characteristics. Healthcare provider fraud detection using machine learning is used as a case study throughout the paper to ground the discussion in a real-world online learning challenge.</description>

      <title>SLS-BRD: A system-level approach to seeking generalised feedback Nash equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a policy learning algorithm for generalised feedback Nash equilibrium seeking in $N_P$-players non-cooperative dynamic games. We consider linear-quadratic games with stochastic dynamics and design a best-response dynamics in which players update and communicate a parametrisation of their state-feedback policies. Our approach leverages the System Level Synthesis (SLS) framework to formulate each player's update rule as the solution of a tractable robust optimisation problem. Under certain conditions, the conditions and rates of convergence can be established. The algorithm is showcased for an exemplary problem from decentralised control of multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Zero-Shot Scalable Collaboration</title>

Abstract: The rise of multi-agent systems, especially the success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), is reshaping our future across diverse domains like autonomous vehicle networks. However, MARL still faces significant challenges, particularly in achieving zero-shot scalability, which allows trained MARL models to be directly applied to unseen tasks with varying numbers of agents. In addition, real-world multi-agent systems usually contain agents with different functions and strategies, while the existing scalable MARL methods only have limited heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a novel MARL framework named Scalable and Heterogeneous Proximal Policy Optimization (SHPPO), integrating heterogeneity into parameter-shared PPO-based MARL networks. we first leverage a latent network to adaptively learn strategy patterns for each agent. Second, we introduce a heterogeneous layer for decision-making, whose parameters are specifically generated by the learned latent variables. Our approach is scalable as all the parameters are shared except for the heterogeneous layer, and gains both inter-individual and temporal heterogeneity at the same time. We implement our approach based on the state-of-the-art backbone PPO-based algorithm as SHPPO, while our approach is agnostic to the backbone and can be seamlessly plugged into any parameter-shared MARL method. SHPPO exhibits superior performance over the baselines such as MAPPO and HAPPO in classic MARL environments like Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and Google Research Football (GRF), showcasing enhanced zero-shot scalability and offering insights into the learned latent representation's impact on team performance by visualization.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Coalitions between EV Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) is driving the expansion of charging infrastructure globally. This expansion, however, places significant charging demand on the electricity grid, impacting grid operations and electricity pricing. While coordination among all charging stations is beneficial, it may not be always feasible. However, a subset of charging stations, which could be jointly operated by a company, could coordinate to decide their charging profile. In this paper we investigate whether such coalitions between charging stations is better than no coordination.
  We model EV charging as a non-cooperative aggregative game, where each station's cost is determined by both monetary payments tied to reactive electricity prices on the grid and its sensitivity to deviations from a nominal charging profile. We consider a solution concept that we call $\mathcal{C}$-Nash equilibrium, which is tied to a coalition $\mathcal{C}$ of charging stations coordinating to reduce their cumulative costs. We provide sufficient conditions, in terms of the demand and sensitivity of charging stations, to determine when independent (uncoordinated) operation of charging stations could result in lower overall costs to charging stations, the coalition, and charging stations outside the coalition. Somewhat counter to intuition, we demonstrate scenarios where allowing charging stations to operate independently is better than coordinating as a coalition. Jointly, these results provide operators of charging stations insights into how to coordinate their charging behavior, and open several research directions.</description>

      <title>Validation of critical maneuvers based on shared control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the validation of shared control strategies for critical maneuvers in automated driving systems. Shared control involves collaboration between the driver and automation, allowing both parties to actively engage and cooperate at different levels of the driving task. The involvement of the driver adds complexity to the control loop, necessitating comprehensive validation methodologies. The proposed approach focuses on two critical maneuvers: overtaking in low visibility scenarios and lateral evasive actions. A modular architecture with an arbitration module and shared control algorithms is implemented, primarily focusing on the lateral control of the vehicle. The validation is conducted using a dynamic simulator, involving 8 real drivers interacting with a virtual environment. The results demonstrate improved safety and user acceptance, indicating the effectiveness of the shared control strategies in comparison with no shared-control support. Future work involves implementing shared control in drive-by-wire systems to enhance safety and driver comfort during critical maneuvers. Overall, this research contributes to the development and validation of shared control approaches in automated driving systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the methodology for building a dynamic risk assessment for ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance Systems) algorithms in parking scenarios, fusing exterior and interior perception for a better understanding of the scene and a more comprehensive risk estimation. This includes the definition of a dynamic risk methodology that depends on the situation from inside and outside the vehicle, the creation of a multi-sensor dataset of risk assessment for ADAS benchmarking purposes, and a Local Dynamic Map (LDM) that fuses data from the exterior and interior of the car to build an LDM-based Dynamic Risk Assessment System (DRAS).</description>

      <title>Generalizable Temperature Nowcasting with Physics-Constrained RNNs for Predictive Maintenance of Wind Turbine Components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning plays an important role in the operation of current wind energy production systems. One central application is predictive maintenance to increase efficiency and lower electricity costs by reducing downtimes. Integrating physics-based knowledge in neural networks to enforce their physical plausibilty is a promising method to improve current approaches, but incomplete system information often impedes their application in real world scenarios. We describe a simple and efficient way for physics-constrained deep learning-based predictive maintenance for wind turbine gearbox bearings with partial system knowledge. The approach is based on temperature nowcasting constrained by physics, where unknown system coefficients are treated as learnable neural network parameters. Results show improved generalization performance to unseen environments compared to a baseline neural network, which is especially important in low data scenarios often encountered in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Wireless Resource Optimization in Hybrid Semantic/Bit Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potential in significant resource savings and efficient information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical cellular network paradigm where two modes of SemCom and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes rather complicated and challenging, given the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we specially develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by utilizing a Lagrange primal-dual transformation method and a preference list-based heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results not only demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical queuing model, but also validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>An Information-State Based Approach to Linear Time Varying System Identification and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of system identification for linear time varying systems. We propose a new system realization approach that uses an "information-state" as the state vector, where the "information-state" is composed of a finite number of past inputs and outputs. The system identification algorithm uses input-output data to fit an autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) to represent the current output in terms of finite past inputs and outputs. This information-state-based approach allows us to directly realize a state-space model using the estimated time varying ARMA paramters linear time varying (LTV) systems. The paper develops the theoretical foundation for using ARMA parameters-based system representation using only the concept of linear observability, details the reasoning for exact output modeling using only the finite history, and shows that there is no need to separate the free and the forced response for identification. The paper also discusses the implications of using the information-state system for optimal output feedback control and shows that the solution obtained using a suitably posed information state problem is optimal for the original problem. The proposed approach is tested on various different systems, and the performance is compared with state-of-the-art LTV system identification techniques.</description>

      <title>Aggregated demand flexibility prediction of residential thermostatically controlled loads and participation in electricity balance markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aggregate demand flexibility of a set of thermostatically controlled residential loads (TCLs) can be represented by a virtual battery (VB) in order to manage their participation in the electricity markets. For this purpose, it is necessary to know in advance and with a high level of reliability the maximum power that can be supplied by the aggregation of TCLs. A probability function of the power that can be supplied by a VB is introduced. This probability function is used to predict the demand flexibility using a new experimental probabilistic method based on a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and extremum search by bisection algorithm (MC&amp;ESB). As a result, the maximum flexibility power that a VB can provide with a certain guaranteed probability is obtained. The performance and validity of the proposed method are demonstrated in three different case studies where a VB bids its aggregate power in the Spanish electricity balancing markets (SEBM).</description>

      <title>CESAR: Control Envelope Synthesis via Angelic Refinements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for synthesizing provably correct control envelopes for hybrid systems. Control envelopes characterize families of safe controllers and are used to monitor untrusted controllers at runtime. Our algorithm fills in the blanks of a hybrid system's sketch specifying the desired shape of the control envelope, the possible control actions, and the system's differential equations. In order to maximize the flexibility of the control envelope, the synthesized conditions saying which control action can be chosen when should be as permissive as possible while establishing a desired safety condition from the available assumptions, which are augmented if needed. An implicit, optimal solution to this synthesis problem is characterized using hybrid systems game theory, from which explicit solutions can be derived via symbolic execution and sound, systematic game refinements. Optimality can be recovered in the face of approximation via a dual game characterization. The resulting algorithm, Control Envelope Synthesis via Angelic Refinements (CESAR), is demonstrated in a range of safe control synthesis examples with different control challenges.</description>

      <title>State of Health Estimation for Battery Modules with Parallel-Connected Cells Under Cell-to-Cell Variations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03097v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State of health (SOH) estimation for lithium-ion battery modules with cells connected in parallel is a challenging problem, especially with cell-to-cell variations. Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA) are effective at the cell level, but a generalizable method to extend them to module-level SOH estimation remains missing, when only module-level measurements are available. This paper proposes a new method and demonstrates that, with multiple features systematically selected from the module-level ICA and DVA, the module-level SOH can be estimated with high accuracy and confidence in the presence of cell-to-cell variations. First, an information theory-based feature selection algorithm is proposed to find an optimal set of features for module-level SOH estimation. Second, a relevance vector regression (RVR)-based module-level SOH estimation model is proposed to provide both point estimates and three-sigma credible intervals while maintaining model sparsity. With more selected features incorporated, the proposed method achieves better estimation accuracy and higher confidence at the expense of higher model complexity. When applied to a large experimental dataset, the proposed method and the resulting sparse model lead to module-level SOH estimates with 0.5% root-mean-square errors and 1.5% average three-sigma values. With all the training processes completed offboard, the proposed method has low computational complexity for onboard implementations.</description>

      <title>Instrumental Variables based DREM for Online Asymptotic Identification of Perturbed Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing online continuous-time parameter estimation laws provide exact (asymptotic/exponential or finite/fixed time) identification of dynamical linear/nonlinear systems parameters only if the external perturbations are equaled to zero or independent with the regressor of the system. However, in real systems the disturbances are almost always non-vanishing and dependent with the regressor. In the presence of perturbations with such properties the above-mentioned identification approaches ensure only boundedness of a parameter estimation error. The main goal of this study is to close this gap and develop a novel online continuous-time parameter estimator, which guarantees exact asymptotic identification of unknown parameters of linear systems in the presence of unknown but bounded perturbations and has relaxed convergence conditions. To achieve the aforementioned goal, it is proposed to augment the deeply investigated Dynamic Regressor Extension and Mixing (DREM) procedure with the novel Instrumental Variables (IV) based extension scheme with averaging. Such an approach allows one to obtain a set of scalar regression equations with asymptotically vanishing perturbation if the initial disturbance that affects the plant is bounded and independent not with the system regressor, but with the instrumental variable. It is rigorously proved that a gradient estimation law designed on the basis of such scalar regressions ensures online unbiased asymptotic identification of the parameters of the perturbed linear systems if some weak independence and excitation assumptions are met. Theoretical results are illustrated and supported with adequate numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the eco-driving problem for connected vehicles on urban roads, considering localization uncertainty. Eco-driving is defined as longitudinal speed planning and control on roads with the presence of a sequence of traffic lights. We solve the problem by using a data-driven model predictive control (MPC) strategy. This approach involves learning a cost-to-go function and constraints from state-input data. The cost-to-go function represents the remaining energy-to-spend from the given state, and the constraints ensure that the controlled vehicle passes the upcoming traffic light timely while obeying traffic laws. The resulting convex optimization problem has a short horizon and is amenable for real-time implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world vehicle experiments. Our method demonstrates $12\%$ improvement in energy efficiency compared to the traditional approaches, which plan longitudinal speed by solving a long-horizon optimal control problem and track the planned speed using another controller, as evidenced by vehicle experiments.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the risk-aware control of stochastic systems with temporal logic specifications dynamically assigned during runtime. Conventional risk-aware control typically assumes that all specifications are predefined and remain unchanged during runtime. In this paper, we propose a novel, provably correct model predictive control scheme for linear systems with additive unbounded stochastic disturbances that dynamically evaluates the feasibility of runtime signal temporal logic specifications and automatically reschedules the control inputs accordingly. The control method guarantees the probabilistic satisfaction of newly accepted specifications without sacrificing the satisfaction of the previously accepted ones. The proposed control method is validated by a robotic motion planning case study.</description>

      <title>Credit vs. Discount-Based Congestion Pricing: A Comparison Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13923v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tolling, or congestion pricing, offers a promising traffic management policy for regulating congestion, but has also attracted criticism for placing outsized financial burdens on low-income users. Credit-based congestion pricing (CBCP) and discount-based congestion pricing (DBCP) policies, which respectively provide travel credits and toll discounts to low-income users on tolled roads, have emerged as promising mechanisms for reducing traffic congestion without worsening societal inequities. However, the optimal design of CBCP and DBCP policies, as well as their relative advantages and disadvantages, remain poorly understood. To address this, we study the effects of implementing CBCP and DBCP policies to route users on a network of multi-lane highways with tolled express lanes. We formulate a non-atomic routing game framework in which a subset of eligible users is granted toll relief in the form of a fixed budget or toll discount, while the remaining ineligible users must pay out-of-pocket. We prove the existence of Nash equilibrium traffic flow patterns corresponding to any given CBCP or DBCP policy. Under the additional assumption that eligible users have time-invariant VoTs, we provide a convex program to efficiently compute these equilibria. For networks consisting of a single edge, we identify conditions under which CBCP policies outperform DBCP policies (and vice versa), in the sense of improving eligible users' access to the express lane. Finally, we present empirical results from a CBCP pilot study of the San Mateo 101 Express Lane Project in California. Our empirical results corroborate our theoretical analysis of the impact of deploying credit-based and discount-based policies, and lend insights into the sensitivity of their impact with respect to the travel demand and users' VoTs.</description>

Abstract: Cyber resilience is a complementary concept to cybersecurity, focusing on the preparation, response, and recovery from cyber threats that are challenging to prevent. Organizations increasingly face such threats in an evolving cyber threat landscape. Understanding and establishing foundations for cyber resilience provide a quantitative and systematic approach to cyber risk assessment, mitigation policy evaluation, and risk-informed defense design. A systems-scientific view toward cyber risks provides holistic and system-level solutions. This chapter starts with a systemic view toward cyber risks and presents the confluence of game theory, control theory, and learning theories, which are three major pillars for the design of cyber resilience mechanisms to counteract increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats in our networks and organizations. Game and control theoretic methods provide a set of modeling frameworks to capture the strategic and dynamic interactions between defenders and attackers. Control and learning frameworks together provide a feedback-driven mechanism that enables autonomous and adaptive responses to threats. Game and learning frameworks offer a data-driven approach to proactively reason about adversarial behaviors and resilient strategies. The confluence of the three lays the theoretical foundations for the analysis and design of cyber resilience. This chapter presents various theoretical paradigms, including dynamic asymmetric games, moving horizon control, conjectural learning, and meta-learning, as recent advances at the intersection. This chapter concludes with future directions and discussions of the role of neurosymbolic learning and the synergy between foundation models and game models in cyber resilience.</description>

      <title>Learning and balancing unknown loads in large-scale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.10142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a system of identical server pools where tasks with exponentially distributed service times arrive as a time-inhomogenenous Poisson process. An admission threshold is used in an inner control loop to assign incoming tasks to server pools while, in an outer control loop, a learning scheme adjusts this threshold over time to keep it aligned with the unknown offered load of the system. In a many-server regime, we prove that the learning scheme reaches an equilibrium along intervals of time where the normalized offered load per server pool is suitably bounded, and that this results in a balanced distribution of the load. Furthermore, we establish a similar result when tasks with Coxian distributed service times arrive at a constant rate and the threshold is adjusted using only the total number of tasks in the system. The novel proof technique developed in this paper, which differs from a traditional fluid limit analysis, allows to handle rapid variations of the first learning scheme, triggered by excursions of the occupancy process that have vanishing size. Moreover, our approach allows to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the system with Coxian distributed service times without relying on a fluid limit of a detailed state descriptor.</description>

      <title>Rational social distancing policy during epidemics with limited healthcare capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemics of infectious diseases posing a serious risk to human health have occurred throughout history. During recent epidemics there has been much debate about policy, including how and when to impose restrictions on behaviour. Policymakers must balance a complex spectrum of objectives, suggesting a need for quantitative tools. Whether health services might be `overwhelmed' has emerged as a key consideration. Here we show how costly interventions, such as taxes or subsidies on behaviour, can be used to exactly align individuals' decision making with government preferences even when these are not aligned. In order to achieve this, we develop a nested optimisation algorithm of both the government intervention strategy and the resulting equilibrium behaviour of individuals. We focus on a situation in which the capacity of the healthcare system to treat patients is limited and identify conditions under which the disease dynamics respect the capacity limit. We find an extremely sharp drop in peak infections at a critical maximum infection cost in the government's objective function. This is in marked contrast to the gradual reduction of infections if individuals make decisions without government intervention. We find optimal interventions vary less strongly in time when interventions are costly to the government and that the critical cost of the policy switch depends on how costly interventions are.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Cascade: Kinematic Planning for N-ball Toss Juggling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic movements are ubiquitous in human motor behavior as they tend to be more efficient and can solve a broader range of skill domains than their quasi-static counterparts. For decades, robotic juggling tasks have been among the most frequently studied dynamic manipulation problems since the required dynamic dexterity can be scaled to arbitrarily high difficulty. However, successful approaches have been limited to basic juggling skills, indicating a lack of understanding of the required constraints for dexterous toss juggling. We present a detailed analysis of the toss juggling task, identifying the key challenges and formalizing it as a trajectory optimization problem. Building on our state-of-the-art, real-world toss juggling platform, we reach the theoretical limits of toss juggling in simulation, evaluate a resulting real-time controller in environments of varying difficulty and achieve robust toss juggling of up to 17 balls on two anthropomorphic manipulators.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Rapid Exploration in Close-Proximity of an Asteroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing number of space missions may overwhelm ground support infrastructure, prompting the need for autonomous deep-space guidance, navigation, and control (GN\&amp;C) systems. These systems offer sustainable and cost-effective solutions, particularly for asteroid missions that deal with uncertain environments. This study proposes a paradigm shift from the proposals currently found in the literature for autonomous asteroid exploration, which inherit the conservative architecture from the ground-in-the-loop approach that relies heavily on reducing uncertainties before close-proximity operations. Instead, it advocates for robust guidance and control to handle uncertainties directly, without extensive navigation campaigns. From a series of conservative assumptions, we demonstrate the feasibility of this autonomous GN\&amp;C for robotic spacecraft by using existing technology. It is shown that a bolder operational approach enables autonomous spacecraft to significantly reduce exploration time by weeks or months. This paradigm shift holds great potential for reducing costs and saving time in autonomous missions of the future.</description>

      <title>Perception Simplex: Verifiable Collision Avoidance in Autonomous Vehicles Amidst Obstacle Detection Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning have revolutionized cyber-physical applications, including the development of Autonomous Vehicles. However, real-world collisions involving autonomous control of vehicles have raised significant safety concerns regarding the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in safety-critical tasks, particularly Perception. The inherent unverifiability of DNNs poses a key challenge in ensuring their safe and reliable operation.
  In this work, we propose Perception Simplex (PS), a fault-tolerant application architecture designed for obstacle detection and collision avoidance. We analyze an existing LiDAR-based classical obstacle detection algorithm to establish strict bounds on its capabilities and limitations. Such analysis and verification have not been possible for deep learning-based perception systems yet. By employing verifiable obstacle detection algorithms, PS identifies obstacle existence detection faults in the output of unverifiable DNN-based object detectors. When faults with potential collision risks are detected, appropriate corrective actions are initiated. Through extensive analysis and software-in-the-loop simulations, we demonstrate that PS provides predictable and deterministic fault tolerance against obstacle existence detection faults, establishing a robust safety guarantee.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Distributed Feedback Optimization for Aggregative Cooperative Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed aggregative optimization is a recently emerged framework in which the agents of a network want to minimize the sum of local objective functions, each one depending on the agent decision variable (e.g., the local position of a team of robots) and an aggregation of all the agents' variables (e.g., the team barycentre). In this paper, we address a distributed feedback optimization framework in which agents implement a local (distributed) policy to reach a steady-state minimizing an aggregative cost function. We propose Aggregative Tracking Feedback, i.e., a novel distributed feedback optimization law in which each agent combines a closed-loop gradient flow with a consensus-based dynamic compensator reconstructing the missing global information. By using tools from system theory, we prove that Aggregative Tracking Feedback steers the network to a stationary point of an aggregative optimization problem with (possibly) nonconvex objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations on a multi-robot surveillance scenario.</description>

      <title>Shallow Encounters' Impact on Asteroid Deflection Prediction and Implications on Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytical approximations are commonly employed in the initial trajectory design phase of a mission to rapidly explore a broad design space. In the context of an asteroid deflection mission, accurately predicting deflection is crucial to determining the spacecraft's trajectory that will produce the desired outcome. However, the dynamics involved are intricate, and simplistic models may not fully capture the system's complexity. This study assesses the precision and limitations of analytical models in predicting deflection, comparing them to more accurate numerical simulations. The findings reveal that encounters with perturbing bodies, even at significant distances (a dozen times the radii of the sphere of influence of the perturbing planet), can markedly disturb the deflected asteroid's trajectory, resulting in notable disparities between analytical and numerical predictions. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are explained, and provisional general guidelines are provided to assist mission analysts in addressing such occurrences. By comprehending the impact of shallow encounters on deflection, this study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the trajectory planning process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asteroid deflection missions.</description>

      <title>CSM-H-R: A Context Modeling Framework in Supporting Reasoning Automation for Interoperable Intelligent Systems and Privacy Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automation of High-Level Context (HLC) reasoning across intelligent systems at scale is imperative because of the unceasing accumulation of contextual data, the trend of the fusion of data from multiple sources (e.g., sensors, intelligent systems), and the intrinsic complexity and dynamism of context-based decision-making processes. To mitigate the challenges posed by these issues, we propose a novel Hierarchical Ontology-State Modeling (HOSM) framework CSM-H-R, which programmatically combines ontologies and states at the modeling phase and runtime phase for attaining the ability to recognize meaningful HLC. It builds on the model of our prior work on the Context State Machine (CSM) engine by incorporating the H (Hierarchy) and R (Relationship and tRansition) dimensions to take care of the dynamic aspects of context. The design of the framework supports the sharing and interoperation of context among intelligent systems and the components for handling CSMs and the management of hierarchy, relationship, and transition. Case studies are developed for IntellElevator and IntellRestaurant, two intelligent applications in a smart campus setting. The prototype implementation of the framework experiments on translating the HLC reasoning into vector and matrix computing and presents the potential of using advanced probabilistic models to reach the next level of automation in integrating intelligent systems; meanwhile, privacy protection support is achieved in the application domain by anonymization through indexing and reducing information correlation. An implementation of the framework is available at https://github.com/songhui01/CSM-H-R.</description>

      <title>An Anomaly Behavior Analysis Framework for Securing Autonomous Vehicle Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a rapidly growing cyber-physical platform, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are encountering more security challenges as their capabilities continue to expand. In recent years, adversaries are actively targeting the perception sensors of autonomous vehicles with sophisticated attacks that are not easily detected by the vehicles' control systems. This work proposes an Anomaly Behavior Analysis approach to detect a perception sensor attack against an autonomous vehicle. The framework relies on temporal features extracted from a physics-based autonomous vehicle behavior model to capture the normal behavior of vehicular perception in autonomous driving. By employing a combination of model-based techniques and machine learning algorithms, the proposed framework distinguishes between normal and abnormal vehicular perception behavior. To demonstrate the application of the framework in practice, we performed a depth camera attack experiment on an autonomous vehicle testbed and generated an extensive dataset. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using this real-world data and released the dataset for public access. To our knowledge, this dataset is the first of its kind and will serve as a valuable resource for the research community in evaluating their intrusion detection techniques effectively.</description>

      <title>Backward Reachability Analysis of Perturbed Continuous-Time Linear Systems Using Set Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backward reachability analysis computes the set of states that reach a target set under the competing influence of control input and disturbances. Depending on their interplay, the backward reachable set either represents all states that can be steered into the target set or all states that cannot avoid entering it -- the corresponding solutions can be used for controller synthesis and safety verification, respectively. A popular technique for backward reachable set computation solves Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations, which scales exponentially with the state dimension due to gridding the state space. In this work, we instead use set propagation techniques to design backward reachability algorithms for linear time-invariant systems. Crucially, the proposed algorithms scale only polynomially with the state dimension. Our numerical examples demonstrate the tightness of the obtained backward reachable sets and show an overwhelming improvement of our proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art methods regarding scalability, as systems with well over a hundred states can now be analyzed.</description>

      <title>Mode Selection in Cognitive Radar Networks</title>

Abstract: Cognitive Radar Networks, which were popularized by Simon Haykin in 2006, have been proposed to address limitations with legacy radar installations. These limitations include large physical size, power consumption, fixed operating parameters, and single point vulnerabilities. Cognitive radar solves part of this problem through adaptability, using biologically inspired techniques to observe the environment and adjust operation accordingly. Cognitive radar networks (CRNs) extend the capabilities of cognitive radar spatially, providing the opportunity to observe targets from multiple angles to mitigate stealth effects; distribute resources over space and in time; obtain better tracking performance; and gain more information from a scene. Often, problems of cognition in CRNs are viewed through the lens of iterative learning problems - one or multiple cognitive processes are implemented in the network, where each process first observes the environment, then selects operating parameters (from discrete or continuous options) using the history of observations and previous rewards, then repeats the cycle. Further, cognitive radar networks often are modeled with a flexible architecture and wide-bandwidth front-ends, enabling the addition of electronic support measures such as passive signal estimation. In this work we consider questions of the form "How should a cognitive radar network choose when to observe targets?" and "How can a cognitive radar network reduce the amount of energy it uses?". We implement tools from the multi-armed bandit and age of information literature to select modes for the network, choosing either an active radar mode or a passive signal estimation mode. We show that through the use of target classes, the network can determine how often each target should be observed to optimize tracking performance.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of magnetic tunnel junction-based computational random-access memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional computing paradigm struggles to fulfill the rapidly growing demands from emerging applications, especially those for machine intelligence, because much of the power and energy is consumed by constant data transfers between logic and memory modules. A new paradigm, called "computational random-access memory (CRAM)" has emerged to address this fundamental limitation. CRAM performs logic operations directly using the memory cells themselves, without having the data ever leave the memory. The energy and performance benefits of CRAM for both conventional and emerging applications have been well established by prior numerical studies. However, there lacks an experimental demonstration and study of CRAM to evaluate its computation accuracy, which is a realistic and application-critical metrics for its technological feasibility and competitiveness. In this work, a CRAM array based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is experimentally demonstrated. First, basic memory operations as well as 2-, 3-, and 5-input logic operations are studied. Then, a 1-bit full adder with two different designs is demonstrated. Based on the experimental results, a suite of modeling has been developed to characterize the accuracy of CRAM computation. Further analysis of scalar addition, multiplication, and matrix multiplication shows promising results. These results are then applied to a complete application: a neural network based handwritten digit classifier, as an example to show the connection between the application performance and further MTJ development. The classifier achieved almost-perfect classification accuracy, with reasonable projections of future MTJ development. With the confirmation of MTJ-based CRAM's accuracy, there is a strong case that this technology will have a significant impact on power- and energy-demanding applications of machine intelligence.</description>
