      <title>Explicit lower bounds for opaque sets of unit square and unit disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit lower bounds for the length of the shortest opaque set for the unit disc and the unit square in the Euclidean plane are derived. The results are based on an explicit application of the general method of Kawamura, Moriyama, Otachi and Pach. While the bound for the unit square only slightly improves the existing bound, the bound for the unit disc is new and based on the idea that the free parameters in the general method can be optimized due to the strong symmetry properties of the disc. Our approach illustrates both the power and the limitations of the method.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure. II. Path-width and additive quasi-isometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if a graph $G$ admits a quasi-isometry $\phi$ to a graph $H$ of bounded path-width, then we can assign a non-negative integer length to each edge of $H$, such that the same function $\phi$ is a quasi-isometry to this weighted version of $H$, with error only an additive constant.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure. III. Excluding a fat tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robertson and Seymour proved that for every finite tree $H$, there exists $k$ such that every finite graph $G$ with no $H$ minor has path-width at most $k$; and conversely, for every integer $k$, there is a finite tree $H$ such that every finite graph $G$ with an $H$ minor has path-width more than $k$. If we (twice) replace ``path-width'' by ``line-width'', the same is true for infinite graphs $G$.
  We prove a ``coarse graph theory'' analogue, as follows. For every finite tree $H$ and every $c$, there exist $k,L,C$ such that every graph that does not contain $H$ as a $c$-fat minor admits an $(L,C)$-quasi-isonetry to a graph with line-width at most $k$; and conversely, for all $k,L,C$ there exist $c$ and a finite tree $H$ such that every graph that contains $H$ as a $c$-fat minor admits no $(L,C)$-quasi-isometry to a graph with line-width at most $k$.</description>

      <title>On the polar of Schneider's difference body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06191v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order extension of the difference body $DK$ of a convex body $K\subset\mathbb R^n$, the convex body $D^m(K)$ in $\mathbb R^{nm}$. He conjectured that its volume is minimized for ellipsoids when the volume of $K$ is fixed.
  In this work, we solve a dual version of this problem: we show that the volume of the polar body of $D^m(K)$ is maximized precisely by ellipsoids. For $m=1$ this recovers the symmetric case of the celebrated Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality. We also show that Schneider's conjecture cannot be tackled using standard symmetrization techniques, contrary to this new inequality. As an application for our results, we prove Schneider's conjecture asymptotically \'a la Bourgain-Milman. We also consider a functional version.</description>

      <title>Spaces with Riemannian curvature bounds are universally infinitesimally Hilbertian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a metric space $X$ that, at every point, has a Gromov-Hausdorff tangent with the splitting property (i.e. every geodesic line splits off a factor $\mathbb{R}$), is universally infinitesimally Hilbertian (i.e. $W^{1,2}(X,\mu)$ is a Hilbert space for every measure $\mu$). This connects the infinitesimal geometry of $X$ to its analytic properties and is, to our knowledge, the first general criterion guaranteeing universal infinitesimal Hilbertianity. Using it we establish universal infinitesimal Hilbertianity of finite dimensional RCD-spaces. We moreover show that (possibly infinite dimensional) Alexandrov spaces are universally infinitesimally Hilbertian and construct an isometric embedding of tangent modules.</description>

      <title>Mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problems for bodies of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, one of which, appearing multiple times, is free and the rest are fixed. In the case where all bodies involved are symmetric around a common axis, we provide a complete solution to this problem, without assuming any regularity. In particular, we refine Firey's classification of area measures of figures of revolution.
  In our argument, we introduce an easy way to transform mixed area measures and mixed volumes involving axially symmetric bodies, and we significantly improve Firey's estimate on the local behavior of area measures. As a secondary result, we obtain a family of Hadwiger type theorems for convex valuations that are invariant under rotations around an axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, all but one of them are fixed. We provide a solution in the case where the fixed reference bodies are (n-1)-dimensional disks with parallel axes and the measure has no mass at the poles of the sphere determined by this axis.</description>

      <title>Geodesic complexity of the octahedron, and an algorithm for cut loci on convex polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19362v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geodesic complexity of a length space $X$ quantifies the required number of case distinctions to continuously choose a shortest path connecting any given start and end point. We prove a local lower bound for the geodesic complexity of $X$ obtained by embedding simplices into $X\times X$. We additionally create and prove correctness of an algorithm to find cut loci on surfaces of convex polyhedra, as the structure of a space's cut loci is related to its geodesic complexity. We use these techniques to prove the geodesic complexity of the octahedron is four. Our method is inspired by earlier work of Recio-Mitter and Davis, and thus recovers their results on the geodesic complexity of the $n$-torus and the tetrahedron, respectively.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Stability of Supervised Learning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of distance between supervised learning problems, which we call the Risk distance. This distance, inspired by optimal transport, facilitates stability results; one can quantify how seriously issues like sampling bias, noise, limited data, and approximations might change a given problem by bounding how much these modifications can move the problem under the Risk distance. With the distance established, we explore the geometry of the resulting space of supervised learning problems, providing explicit geodesics and proving that the set of classification problems is dense in a larger class of problems. We also provide two variants of the Risk distance: one that incorporates specified weights on a problem's predictors, and one that is more sensitive to the contours of a problem's risk landscape.</description>

      <title>Quantization dimensions of negative order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of defining meaningful upper and lower quantization dimensions for a compactly supported Borel probability measure of order $r$, including negative values of $r$. To this end, we use the concept of partition functions, which generalizes the idea of the $L^{q}$-spectrum and in this way naturally extends the work in [M. Kesseb\"ohmer, A. Niemann, and S. Zhu. Quantization dimensions of probability measures via R\'enyi dimensions. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 376.7 (2023)]. In particular, we provide natural fractal geometric bounds as well as easily verifiable necessary conditions for the existence of the quantization dimensions. The exact asymptotics of the quantization error of negative order for absolutely continuous measures are stated, whereby an open question from [S. Graf, H. Luschgy. Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 136, 3 (2004)] regarding the geometric mean error is also answered in the affirmative.</description>
