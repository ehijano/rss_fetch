      <title>Simulations Predict Improved Valve Performance Without Direct Leaflet Intervention After Neonatal Truncus Arteriosus Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Truncus arteriosus (TA) is a rare and severe congenital heart disease. Quadricuspid valve morphology occurs in 25% of all TA patients and is linked to regurgitation and increased risk of re-operation. It remains unclear how hemodynamic changes after TA repair alter valve performance. This study simulated pre- and postoperative conditions in a neonatal TA patient to investigate valve performance without direct intervention. We hypothesize that valve performance before and after truncal repair can be predicted in-silico, matching in-vivo imaging and identifying mechanisms how hemodynamic changes after repair will reduce valve regurgitation without direct intervention. Pre- and postoperative CT images of a neonatal patient with quadricuspid valve were segmented. Free edge length and geometric height from the patient's echocardiogram were used to model the valve. For the preoperative condition, ventricular pressures were set equal modeling an unrestricted ventricular septal defect. Systemic and pulmonary resistances were tuned based on the patient's Qp:Qs ratio. For the postoperative condition, boundary conditions were modified to mimic patient-specific hemodynamics after TA repair. The preoperative simulation confirmed mild valve regurgitation seen in-vivo. Interaction between asymmetric flow and surrounding vessel resulted in asymmetric opening and closing. Poor central coaptation led to a central regurgitant jet toward the septum. Altered postoperative hemodynamics improved coaptation and eliminated regurgitation, as seen in-vivo. This modeling approach reproduced in-vivo pre- and postoperative valve performance and identified mechanisms improving coaptation after TA repair. TA repair led to elimination of regurgitation due to enhanced central coaptation. Thus, altered postoperative hemodynamic conditions after TA repair may improve valve performance without direct leaflet intervention.</description>

      <title>Constitutive parameter inference using physics-based data-driven modeling in full volume datasets of intact and torn rotator cuff tendons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we characterized the material properties of an animal model of the rotator cuff tendon using full volume datasets of both its intact and injured states by capturing internal strain behavior throughout the tendon. Our experimental setup, involving tension along the fiber direction, activated volumetric, tensile, and shear mechanisms due to the tendon's complex geometry. We implemented an approach to model inference that we refer to as variational system identification (VSI) to solve the weak form of the stress equilibrium equation using these full volume displacements. Three constitutive models were used for parameter inference: a neo-Hookean model, a modified Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model with higher-order terms in the first and second invariants, and a reduced polynomial model consisting of terms based on the first, second, and fiber-related invariants. Inferred parameters were further refined using an adjoint-based partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization framework. Our results show that the modified HGO model captures the tendon's deformation mechanisms with reasonable accuracy, while the neo-Hookean model fails to reproduce key internal features, particularly the shear behavior in the injured tendon. Surprisingly, the simplified polynomial model performed comparably to the modified HGO formulation using only three terms. These findings suggest that while current constitutive models do not fully replicate the complex internal mechanics of the tendon, they are capable of capturing key trends in both intact and damaged tissue, using a homogeneous modeling approach. Continued model development is needed to bridge this gap and enable clinical-grade, predictive simulations of tendon injury and repair.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised full-field Bayesian inference of orthotropic hyperelasticity from a single biaxial test: a myocardial case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiac muscle tissue exhibits highly non-linear hyperelastic and orthotropic material behavior during passive deformation. Traditional constitutive identification protocols therefore combine multiple loading modes and typically require multiple specimens and substantial handling. In soft living tissues, such protocols are challenged by inter- and intra-sample variability and by manipulation-induced alterations of mechanical response, which can bias inverse calibration. In this work we exploit spatially heterogeneous full-field kinematics as an information-rich alternative to multimodal testing. We adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the automated discovery of constitutive models, towards Bayesian parameter inference for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models. Using synthetic myocardial tissue slabs, we demonstrate that a single heterogeneous biaxial experiment, combined with sparse reaction-force measurements, enables robust recovery of Holzapfel-Ogden parameters with quantified uncertainty, across multiple noise levels. The inferred responses agree closely with ground-truth simulations and yield credible intervals that reflect the impact of measurement noise on orthotropic material model inference. Our work supports single-shot, uncertainty-aware characterization of nonlinear orthotropic material models from a single biaxial test, reducing sample demand and experimental manipulation.</description>
