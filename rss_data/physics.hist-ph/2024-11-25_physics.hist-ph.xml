      <title>Astro-HEP-BERT: A bidirectional language model for studying the meanings of concepts in astrophysics and high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present Astro-HEP-BERT, a transformer-based language model specifically designed for generating contextualized word embeddings (CWEs) to study the meanings of concepts in astrophysics and high-energy physics. Built on a general pretrained BERT model, Astro-HEP-BERT underwent further training over three epochs using the Astro-HEP Corpus, a dataset I curated from 21.84 million paragraphs extracted from more than 600,000 scholarly articles on arXiv, all belonging to at least one of these two scientific domains. The project demonstrates both the effectiveness and feasibility of adapting a bidirectional transformer for applications in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science (HPSS). The entire training process was conducted using freely available code, pretrained weights, and text inputs, completed on a single MacBook Pro Laptop (M2/96GB). Preliminary evaluations indicate that Astro-HEP-BERT's CWEs perform comparably to domain-adapted BERT models trained from scratch on larger datasets for domain-specific word sense disambiguation and induction and related semantic change analyses. This suggests that retraining general language models for specific scientific domains can be a cost-effective and efficient strategy for HPSS researchers, enabling high performance without the need for extensive training from scratch.</description>

      <title>Refuting the Metaphysics of Wolfram and Tegmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wolfram's hypergraph dynamics should replace outmoded models in physics. This should even more so be the case if experimental evidence for the theory is found (which I believe is probable). However, due to the breadth and depth of the theory, it may be difficult to produce experimental evidence which falsifies it. Some of Wolfram's personal work relating to his physics project is philosophical, and so mechanics of particular phenomena in the natural world can become a triviality or an aside. In other words, the general theory "casts a wide net", and it is the philosophical topics I will challenge. I find that Wolfram must adopt a radical epistemology through his so-called Observer Theory because there is no clear notion of Truth. Tegmark believes in an objective Truth, but I find its relation to the observer untenable, and the proof of his Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) is gematria. I argue both Wolfram and Tegmark conflate the inherent potential of mathematical truths with their instantiation or actuality in reality, making a similar error to that of the "so-called" Pythagoreans rebuked by Aristotle. Nonetheless, I believe that combinatorial structures of the kind used in the physics project (abstract rewriting, directed acyclic graphs) will be the future of physics as we know it.</description>
