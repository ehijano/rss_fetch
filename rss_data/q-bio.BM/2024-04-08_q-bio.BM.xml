      <title>Optimizing Convolutional Neural Networks for Identifying Invasive Pollinator Apis Mellifera and Finding a Ligand drug to Protect California's Biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In North America, there are many diverse species of native bees crucial for the environment, who are the primary pollinators of most native floral species. The Californian agriculture industry imports European honeybees (Apis Mellifera) primarily for pollinating almonds. Unfortunately, this has resulted in the unintended consequence of disrupting the native ecosystem and threatening many native bee species as they are outcompeted for food. Our first step for protecting the native species is identification with the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to differentiate common native bee species from invasive ones. Removing invasive colonies efficiently without harming native species is difficult as pesticides cause myriad diseases in native species. Our approach seeks to prevent the formation of new queens, causing the colony's collapse. Workers secrete royal jelly, a substance that causes fertility and longevity; it is fed to future honeybee queens. Targeting the production of this substance is safe as no native species use it; small organic molecules (ligands) prevent the proteins Apisimin and MRJP1 from combining and producing an oligomer used to form the substance. Ideal ligands bind to only one of these proteins preventing them from joining together: they have a high affinity for one receptor and a significantly lower affinity for the other. We optimized the CNN to provide a framework for creating Machine Learning models that excel at differentiating between subspecies of insects by measuring the effects of image alteration and class grouping on model performance. The CNN is able to achieve an accuracy of 82% in differentiating between invasive and native bee species; 3 ligands have been identified as effective. Our new approach offers a promising solution to curb the spread of invasive bees within California through an identification and neutralization method.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Mutational Epistasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interconnected processes of protein folding, mutations, epistasis, and evolution have all been the subject of extensive analysis throughout the years due to their significance for structural and evolutionary biology. The origin (molecular basis) of epistasis (the non-additive interactions between mutations) is still, nonetheless, unknown. The existence of a new perspective on protein folding (a problem that needs to be conceived as an analytic whole) will enable us to shed light on the origin of mutational epistasis at the simplest level (within proteins) while also uncovering the reasons on why the genetic background in which they occur (a key component of molecular evolution) could foster changes in epistasis effects. Additionally, because mutations are the source of epistasis, more research is needed to determine the impact of posttranslational modifications (which have the potential to increase the diversity of the proteome by several orders of magnitude) on both mutational epistasis and protein evolvability. Finally, a protein evolution thermodynamic-based analysis that does not consider specific mutational steps or epistasis effects will be discussed. Our study explores the complex processes behind the evolution of proteins upon mutations, clearing up some previously unresolved issues and providing direction for further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Active Causal Learning for Decoding Chemical Complexities with Targeted Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and enhancing inherent properties based on molecular structures is paramount to design tasks in medicine, materials science, and environmental management. Most of the current machine learning and deep learning approaches have become standard for predictions, but they face challenges when applied across different datasets due to reliance on correlations between molecular representation and target properties. These approaches typically depend on large datasets to capture the diversity within the chemical space, facilitating a more accurate approximation, interpolation, or extrapolation of the chemical behavior of molecules. In our research, we introduce an active learning approach that discerns underlying cause-effect relationships through strategic sampling with the use of a graph loss function. This method identifies the smallest subset of the dataset capable of encoding the most information representative of a much larger chemical space. The identified causal relations are then leveraged to conduct systematic interventions, optimizing the design task within a chemical space that the models have not encountered previously. While our implementation focused on the QM9 quantum-chemical dataset for a specific design task-finding molecules with a large dipole moment-our active causal learning approach, driven by intelligent sampling and interventions, holds potential for broader applications in molecular, materials design and discovery.</description>

      <title>A novel molecule generative model of VAE combined with Transformer for unseen structure generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, molecule generation using deep learning has been actively investigated in drug discovery. In this field, Transformer and VAE are widely used as powerful models, but they are rarely used in combination due to structural and performance mismatch of them. This study proposes a model that combines these two models through structural and parameter optimization in handling diverse molecules. The proposed model shows comparable performance to existing models in generating molecules, and showed by far superior performance in generating molecules with unseen structures. Another advantage of this VAE model is that it generates molecules from latent representation, and therefore properties of molecules can be easily predicted or conditioned with it, and indeed, we show that the latent representation of the model successfully predicts molecular properties. Ablation study suggested the advantage of VAE over other generative models like language model in generating novel molecules. It also indicated that the latent representation can be shortened to ~32 dimensional variables without loss of reconstruction, suggesting the possibility of a much smaller molecular descriptor or model than existing ones. This study is expected to provide a virtual chemical library containing a wide variety of compounds for virtual screening and to enable efficient screening.</description>
