      <title>Average-field approximation for very dilute almost-bosonic anyon gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground state of a system of $N$ two-dimensional trapped almost-bosonic anyons subject to an external magnetic field. This setup can equivalently be viewed as bosons interacting through long-range magnetic potentials generated by magnetic charges carried by each particle. These magnetic charges are assumed to be smeared over discs of radius $R$ - a model known as extended anyons. To recover the point-like anyons perspective, we consider the joint limit $R \rightarrow 0$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. We rigorously justify the average-field approximation for any radii $R$ that decay polynomially in $1/N$, and even for certain exponentially decaying $R$. The average-field approximation asserts that the particles behave like independent, identical bosons interacting through a self-consistent magnetic field. Our result significantly improves upon the best-known estimates by Lundholm-Rougerie (2015) and Girardot (2020), and it in particular covers radii that are much smaller than the mean interparticle distance. The proof strategy builds on a recent work on two-dimensional attractive Bose gases by Junge and the author (2025).</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the observable universe from the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is a property of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in which photons from the CMB are gravitationally redshifted, causing the anisotropies in the CMB. An intriguing question is whether one can infer the gravitational perturbations from the ISW effect observed near the Earth. In this work, we address the question using a tomographic reconstruction approach, similar to X-ray CT reconstruction in medical imaging. We develop the mathematical analysis for the stable inversion of the X-ray transform in the cosmological setting. In addition, we provide a numerical study of reconstruction methods, thereby demonstrating the feasibility and potential of the tomography method.</description>

      <title>Symbolic identification of tensor equations in multidimensional physical fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, data-driven methods have shown great promise for discovering governing equations from simulation or experimental data. However, most existing approaches are limited to scalar equations, with few capable of identifying tensor relationships. In this work, we propose a general data-driven framework for identifying tensor equations, referred to as Symbolic Identification of Tensor Equations (SITE). The core idea of SITE--representing tensor equations using a host-plasmid structure--is inspired by the multidimensional gene expression programming (M-GEP) approach. To improve the robustness of the evolutionary process, SITE adopts a genetic information retention strategy. Moreover, SITE introduces two key innovations beyond conventional evolutionary algorithms. First, it incorporates a dimensional homogeneity check to restrict the search space and eliminate physically invalid expressions. Second, it replaces traditional linear scaling with a tensor linear regression technique, greatly enhancing the efficiency of numerical coefficient optimization. We validate SITE using two benchmark scenarios, where it accurately recovers target equations from synthetic data, showing robustness to noise and small sample sizes. Furthermore, SITE is applied to identify constitutive relations directly from molecular simulation data, which are generated without reliance on macroscopic constitutive models. It adapts to both compressible and incompressible flow conditions and successfully identifies the corresponding macroscopic forms, highlighting its potential for data-driven discovery of tensor equation.</description>

      <title>General Mathematical Proof of Occam's Razor; Upgrading Theoretical Physicists' Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper's first aim is to prove a modernized Occam's razor beyond a reasonable doubt. To summarize the main argument in one sentence: If we consider all possible, intelligible, scientific models of ever-higher complexity, democratically, the predictions most favored by these complex models will agree with the predictions of the simplest models. This fact can be proven mathematically, thereby validating Occam's razor. Major parts of this line of reasoning have long preexisted within the depths of the algorithmic information theory literature, but they have always left room for doubts of various kinds. Therefore, we increase the generality, completeness, clarity, accessibility, and credibility of these arguments by countering over a dozen objections. We build our mathematical proof of Occam's razor on the shoulders of the exact 'chain rule' for Kolmogorov complexity.
  Concerning physics, we then go on to diagnose the primary amendable root cause of the present stagnation of the research field of fundamental theoretical physics. We show that the effective antidote would consist in a practically feasible upgrade to the theoretical physicists' research methodology: When proposing new theoretical models, physicists should simply calculate and report the total amount of information that their models consist of. We explain why this methodology would be highly effective as well as how these calculations could be performed efficiently.</description>

      <title>Gauging Non-Invertible Symmetries in (2+1)d Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present practical and formal methods for gauging non-invertible symmetries in (2+1)d topological quantum field theories. Along the way, we generalize various aspects of invertible 0-form gauging, including symmetry fractionalization, discrete torsion, and the fixed point theorem for symmetry action on lines. Our approach involves two complementary strands: the fusion of topological interfaces and Morita theory of fusion 2-categories. We use these methods to derive constraints on gaugeable symmetries and their duals while unifying the prescription for gauging non-invertible 0-form and 1-form symmetries and various higher structures. With a view toward recent advances in creating non-Abelian topological orders from Abelian ones, we give a simple recipe for non-invertible 0-form gauging that takes large classes of the latter to the former. We also describe conditions under which iterated gauging of invertible 0-form symmetries is equivalent to a single-step gauging of a non-invertible symmetry. We conclude with a set of concrete examples illustrating these various phenomena involving gauging symmetries of the infrared limit of the toric code.</description>

      <title>Soliton Synchronization with Randomness: Rogue Waves and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. We give conditions for the synchronous collision of these $N$ solitons. When the solitons velocities are well separated and the solitons have equal amplitude, we show that the local wave profile at the collision point scales as the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function. We show that this behaviour persists when the amplitudes of the solitons are i.i.d. sub-exponential random variables. Namely the central collision peak exhibits universality: its spatial profile converges to the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function, independently of the distribution. We derive Central Limit Theorems for the fluctuations of the profile in the near-field regime (near the collision point) and in the far-regime.</description>

      <title>Fluid-dynamic limit of the Enskog equation with the guaranteed H-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluid-dynamic limit of the Enskog equation with a slight modification is discussed on the basis of the Chapman-Enskog method. This modified version of the Enskog equation has been shown recently by the present authors to ensure the H-theorem. In the present paper, it is shown that the modified version recovers the same fluid-dynamic description of the dense gas as the original Enskog equation, at least up to the level of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier set of equations inclusive. Since the original Enskog equation is known to recover the fluid-dynamical transport properties well, this result implies that the modified version of the Enskog equation provides consistent descriptions both thermodynamically and fluid-dynamically.</description>

      <title>Suleimanov-Talanov self-focusing and the hierarchy of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the self-focusing of wave packets from the point of view of the semiclassical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. A type of finite-time collapse/blowup of the solution of the associated dispersionless limit was investigated by Talanov in the 1960s, and recently Suleimanov identified a special solution of the dispersive problem that formally regularizes the blowup and is related to the hierarchy of the Painlev\'e-III equation. In this paper we approximate the Talanov solutions in the full dispersive equation using a semiclassical soliton ensemble, a sequence of exact reflectionless solutions for a corresponding sequence of values of the semiclassical parameter epsilon tending to zero, approximating the Talanov initial data more and more accurately in the limit as epsilon tends to zero. In this setting, we rigorously establish the validity of the dispersive saturation of the Talanov blowup obtained by Suleimanov. We extend the result to the full hierarchy of higher focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, exhibiting new generalizations of the Talanov initial data that produce such dispersively regularized extreme focusing in both mixed and pure flows. We also argue that generic perturbations of the Talanov initial data lead to a different singularity of the dispersionless limit, namely a gradient catastrophe for which the dispersive regularization is instead based on the tritronqu\'ee solution of the Painlev\'e-I equation and the Peregrine breather solution which appears near points in space time corresponding to the poles of the former transcendental function as shown by Bertola and Tovbis.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Preserving and Accurate scheme for Multiscale Poisson-Nernst-Planck (MPNP) system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and validate a two-species Multiscale model for a Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system, focusing on the correlated motion of positive and negative ions under the influence of a trap. Specifically, we aim to model surface traps whose attraction range, of length delta, is much smaller then the scale of the problem. The physical setup we refer to is an anchored gas drop (bubble) surrounded by a diffusive flow of charged surfactants (ions). When the diffusing surfactants reach the surface of the trap, the anions are adsorbed. As in our previous works [11,6,9,4], the effect of the attractive potential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass conservation and asymptotic analysis. The novelty of this work is the extension of the model proposed in [11], now incorporating the influence of both carriers - positive and negative ions - simultaneously, which is often neglected in traditional approaches that treat ion species independently. In the second part of the paper, we address the treatment of the Coulomb interaction between carriers. When the Debye length lambda_D (proportional to a small parameter epsilon) is very small, one can adopt the so-called Quasi-Neutral limit, which significantly simplifies the system, reducing it to a diffusion equation for a single carriers with effective diffusion coefficient [36,53]. This approach, while simplifying the mathematical model, does not capture the effects of non negligible values of epsilon. When the Debye length is small but not negligible, it may be very expensive to capture the small deviation from the Quasi-Neutral limit by standard methods in the literature. [...]</description>

      <title>The Crossed Product, Modular (Tomita) Dynamics and its Role in the Transition of Type $III$ to Type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann Algebras and Connections to Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the role of the crossed product and the modular (Tomita) dynamics in the transition of type $III$ to type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann algebras which was recently observed in papers by Witten et al. In a preceding paper we argued that type $II_{\infty}$ v.Neumann algebras display certain features which we attributed to quantum gravity effects. We claim that the action of the modular evolution on the quantum fluctuations can be understood as an aspect of quantum gravity. We mention in this context the work of Sakharov on induced gravity. Furthermore we analyse the change of the properties of projectors and partial isometries in the transition from type $III$ to type $II_{\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf tube algebra for domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro type topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) by constructing domain wall tube algebras. We begin by analyzing the domain wall tube algebra associated with bimodule categories, and then extend the construction to multimodule categories over $N$ base fusion categories. We prove that the resulting tube algebra is naturally equipped with a $C^*$ weak Hopf algebra structure. We show that topological excitations localized on domain walls are classified by representations of the corresponding domain wall tube algebra, in the sense that the functor category of bimodules admits a fusion-preserving embedding into the representation category of the domain wall tube algebra. We further establish the folding trick and Morita theory in this context. Then, most crucially, we provide a rigorous construction of the Drinfeld quantum double from weak Hopf boundary tube algebras using a skew-pairing, and establish an isomorphism between domain wall tube algebra and Drinfeld quantum double of boundary tube algebras. Motivated by the correspondence between the domain wall tube algebra and the quantum double of the boundary tube algebras, we introduce the notion of an $N$-tuple algebra and demonstrate how it arises in the multimodule domain wall setting. Finally, we consider defects between two domain walls, showing that such defects can be characterized by representations of a domain wall defect tube algebra. We briefly outline how these defects can be systematically treated within this representation-theoretic framework.</description>

Abstract: The QSSEP, short for quantum symmetric simple exclusion process, is a paradigm model for stochastic quantum dynamics. Averaging over the noise, the quantum dynamics reduce to the well-studied SSEP (symmetric simple exclusion process). These notes provide an introduction to quantum exclusion processes, focusing on the example of QSSEP and its connection to free probability, with an emphasis on mathematical aspects.</description>

      <title>The Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes: the Feynman propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Feynman propagators for the massive Klein--Gordon equation with asymptotically static perturbations. Building on our previous work on the causal propagators, we employ a framework based on propagation of singularities estimates in Vasy's 3sc-calculus. We combine these estimates to prove global spacetime mapping properties for the Feynman propagator, and to show that it satisfies a microlocal Hadamard condition.
  We show that the Feynman propagator can be realized as the inverse of a mapping between appropriate $L^2$-based Sobolev spaces with additional regularity near the asymptotic sources of the Hamiltonian flow, realized as a family of radial points on a compactified spacetime.</description>

Abstract: This work revisits the Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation (DT) approach to non-perturbative quantum gravity in three dimensions. Inspired by a recent combinatorial study by T. Budd and L. Lionni of a subclass of 3-sphere triangulations constructed from trees, called the \emph{triple-tree} class, we present a Monte Carlo investigation of DT decorated with a pair of spanning trees, one spanning the vertices and the other the tetrahedra of the triangulation. The complement of the pair of trees in the triangulation can be viewed as a bipartite graph, called the \emph{middle graph} of the triangulation. In the triple-tree class, the middle graph is restricted to be a tree, and numerical simulations have displayed a qualitatively different phase structure compared to standard DT. Relaxing this restriction, the middle graph comes with two natural invariants, namely the number of connected components and loops. Introducing corresponding coupling constants in the action, allows one to interpolate between the triple-tree class and unrestricted tree-decorated DT. Simulations of this extended model confirm the existence of a new phase, referred to as the \emph{triple-tree phase}, besides the familiar crumpled and branched polymer phases of DT. A statistical analysis of the phase transitions is presented, showing hints that the branched polymer to triple-tree phase transition is continuous.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamically Consistent Free Boundary Model for Two-Phase Flows in an Evolving Domain with Moving Contact Lines, Variable Contact Angles and Bulk-Surface Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent model, which describes the time evolution of a two-phase flow in an evolving domain. The movement of the free boundary of the domain is driven by the velocity field of the mixture in the bulk, which is determined by a Navier--Stokes equation. In order to take interactions between bulk and boundary into account, we further consider two materials on the boundary, which may be the same or different materials as those in the bulk. The bulk and the surface materials are represented by respective phase-fields, whose time evolution is described by a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard equation. This approach allows for a transfer of material between bulk and surface as well as variable contact angles between the diffuse interface in the bulk and the boundary of the domain. To provide a more accurate description of the corresponding contact line motion, we include a generalized Navier slip boundary condition on the velocity field. We derive our model from scratch by considering local mass balance and energy dissipation laws. Finally, the derivation is completed via the Langrange multiplier approach. We further show that our model generalizes previous models from the literature, which can be recovered from our system by either dropping the dynamic boundary conditions or assuming a static boundary of the domain.</description>

      <title>The half-space problem of evaporation and condensation for polyatomic gases and entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the steady Boltzmann equation in one spatial variable for a polyatomic single-component gas in a half-space. Inflow boundary conditions are assumed at the half-space boundary, where particles entering the half-space are distributed as a Maxwellian, an equilibrium distribution characterized by macroscopic parameters of the boundary. At the far end, the gas tends to an equilibrium distribution, which is also Maxwellian. Using conservation laws and an entropy inequality, we derive relations between the macroscopic parameters of the boundary and at infinity required for the existence of solutions. The relations vary depending on the sign of the Mach number at infinity, which dictates whether evaporation or condensation takes place at the interface between the gas and the condensed phase. We explore the obtained relations numerically. This investigation reveals that, although the relations are qualitatively similar for various internal degrees of freedom of the gas, clear quantitative differences exist.</description>

      <title>Neural Entropy-stable conservative flux form neural networks for learning hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural entropy-stable conservative flux form neural network (NESCFN) for learning hyperbolic conservation laws and their associated entropy functions directly from solution trajectories, without requiring any predefined numerical discretization. While recent neural network architectures have successfully integrated classical numerical principles into learned models, most rely on prior knowledge of the governing equations or assume a fixed discretization. Our approach removes this dependency by embedding entropy-stable design principles into the learning process itself, enabling the discovery of physically consistent dynamics in a fully data-driven setting. By jointly learning both the numerical flux function and a corresponding entropy, the proposed method ensures conservation and entropy dissipation, critical for long-term stability and fidelity in the system of hyperbolic conservation laws. Numerical results demonstrate that the method achieves stability and conservation over extended time horizons and accurately captures shock propagation speeds, even without oracle access to future-time solution profiles in the training data.</description>

Abstract: We present the complete set of covariant equations that govern the locally rotationally symmetric torsion spacetimes sourced by Weyssenhoff fluid in Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble gravity. Using these equations, we can explore in detail the peculiar relationship between conformal structure and torsion. We develop a comprehensive scheme to categorize these torsional spacetimes into distinct classes. We explicitly analyze the properties of each class and obtain novel analytical solutions to the gravitational field equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional quantum field theory with an infinite-dimensional symmetry, realized explicitly through a centrally extended affine graded Lie algebra. This symmetry is a direct three-dimensional generalization of the chiral symmetry in the Wess-Zumino-Witten model. Accordingly, this setup provides a framework for extending the methods of two-dimensional conformal field theory to three dimensions, and we expect it to lay the groundwork for exact methods in three-dimensional quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct a class of multivariate generalized hypergeometric series which is conjectured in our previous paper [Alkalaev &amp; Mandrygin 2025] to calculate multipoint one-loop parametric conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. Our approach is based on a simple diagrammatic algorithm which systematically builds both arguments and series coefficients in terms of a convex polygon which is part of the Baxter lattice. The examples of the box, pentagon, and hexagon integrals are considered in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the random adjacency matrices induced by the chronological relations and i.i.d. samples of two spacetimes coincide in law if and only if the spacetimes in question are smoothly isometric. A similar result holds for weighted spacetimes. In the smooth framework of our article, this relaxes the hypotheses of the recent Gromov reconstruction theorem in Lorentzian signature by Braun-S\"amann from a.s. isometry of the respective time separation functions to a.s. order isometry. In a probabilistic way, our result makes a key paradigm of causal set theory rigorous: spacetime can be recovered by only knowing "order" and "number" of its points. It confirms a weak version of Bombelli's conjecture; therefore, it contributes to recent efforts of formalizing the Hauptvermutung (viz. fundamental conjecture) of causal set theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the deformed complex Ginibre ensemble $H=A_0+H_0$, where $H_0$ is the complex matrix with iid Gaussian entries, and $A_0$ is some general $n\times n$ matrix (it can be random and in this case it is independent of $H_0$). Assuming rather general assumptions on $A_0$, we prove that the asymptotic local behavior of the second correlation function of the eigenvalues of such matrices in the bulk coincides with that for the pure complex Ginibre ensemble.</description>

      <title>Transmission eigenvalue distribution in disordered media from radiant field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a field-theoretic framework, called radiant field theory, to calculate the distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation in disordered media. At its core is a self-consistent transport equation for a $2\times 2$ matrix radiance, reminiscent of the radiative transfer equation but capable of capturing coherent interference effects. This framework goes beyond the limitations of the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar theory by accounting for both quasiballistic and diffusive regimes. It also handles open geometries inaccessible to standard wave-equation solvers such as infinite slabs. Analytical and numerical solutions are provided for these geometries, highlighting in particular the impact of the waveguide shape and the grazing modes on the transmission eigenvalue distribution in the quasiballistic regime. By removing the macroscopic assumptions of random matrix models, this microscopic theory enables the calculation of transmission statistics in regimes previously out of reach. It also provides a foundation for exploring more complex observables and physical effects relevant to wavefront shaping in realistic disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Radiant Field Theory: A Transport Approach to Shaped Wave Transmission through Disordered Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a field-theoretic framework to characterize the distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation through disordered media. The central outcome is a transport equation for a matrix-valued radiance, analogous to the classical radiative transport equation but capable of capturing coherent effects encoded in the transmission matrix. Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which presumes uniform angular scattering by material slices. As a result, it remains valid beyond the diffusive regime, accurately describing the transmission eigenvalue distribution in the quasiballistic regime as well. Moreover, the framework is more versatile than the DMPK theory, enabling straightforward incorporation of experimental realities such as absorption and incomplete channel control. These factors are frequently encountered in wave experiments on complex media but have lacked an ab initio theoretical treatment until now. We validate our predictions through numerical simulations based on the microscopic wave equation, confirming the accuracy and broad applicability of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory has various projective characteristics which are captured by what are called anomalies. This paper explores this idea in the context of fully-extended three-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs).
  Given a three-dimensional TQFT (valued in the Morita 3-category of fusion categories), the anomaly identified herein is an obstruction to gauging a naturally occurring orthogonal group of symmetries. In other words, the classical symmetry group almost acts: There is a lack of coherence at the top level. This lack of coherence is captured by a "higher (central) extension" of the orthogonal group, obtained via a modification of the obstruction theory of Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik-Meir [ENO10]. This extension tautologically acts on the given TQFT/fusion category, and this precisely classifies a projective (equivalently anomalous) TQFT. We explain the sense in which this is an analogue of the classical spin representation. This is an instance of a phenomenon emphasized by Freed [Fre23]: Quantum theory is projective.
  We also establish a general relationship between the language of projectivity/anomalies and the language of topological symmetries. We also identify a universal anomaly associated with any theory which is appropriately "simple".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a modification to the Cayley transform that defines a suitable local parameterization for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(3)$. The new mapping is used to construct splitting methods for separable Hamiltonian systems whose phase space is the cotangent bundle of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ or, more general, $\mathrm{SU(3)}^N$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$. Special attention is given to the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for gauge field generation in lattice quantum chromodynamics. We show that the use of the modified Cayley transform instead of the matrix exponential neither affects the time-reversibility nor the volume-preservation of the splitting method. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the Cayley-based algorithms are discussed and illustrated in pure gauge field simulations.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of fluctuations of discretized SHE and KPZ equations in the subcritical weak disorder regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of discretized versions of the stochastic heat equation (SHE) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in spatial dimensions $d\geq 3$ in the weak disorder regime. The discretization is defined using the directed polymer model. Previous research has identified the scaling limit of both equations under a suboptimal moment condition and, in particular, it was established that both converge in law to the same limit. We extend this result by showing that the fluctuations of both equations are close in probability in the subcritical weak disorder regime, indicating that they share the same scaling limit (the existence of which remains open). Our result applies under a moment condition that is expected to hold throughout the interior of the weak disorder phase, which is currently only known under a technical assumption on the environment. We also prove a lower tail concentration of the partition functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study connection probabilities between vertices of the square lattice for the critical random-cluster (FK) model with cluster weight 2, which is related to the critical Ising model. We consider the model on the plane and on domains conformally equivalent to the upper half-plane. We prove that, when appropriately rescaled, the connection probabilities between vertices in the domain or on the boundary have nontrivial limits, as the mesh size of the square lattice is sent to zero, and that those limits are conformally covariant. This provides an important step in the proof of the Delfino-Viti conjecture for FK-Ising percolation as well as an alternative proof of the conformal covariance of the Ising spin correlation functions. In an appendix, we also derive new exact formulas for some Ising boundary spin correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the conditional mutual information of a quantum state is zero if, and only if, the quantum state is a quantum Markov chain. Replacing the Umegaki relative entropy in the definition of the conditional mutual information by the Belavkin-Staszewski (BS) relative entropy, we obtain the BS-conditional mutual information, and we call the states with zero BS-conditional mutual information Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains. In this article, we establish a correspondence which relates quantum Markov chains and BS-quantum Markov chains. This correspondence allows us to find a recovery map for the BS-entropy in the spirit of the Petz recovery map. Furthermore, we show that, over the set of BS-quantum Markov chains, this correspondence constitutes an entanglement-breaking map. Moreover, we prove a structural decomposition of the Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains and also study states for which the BS-conditional mutual information is only approximately zero. We subsequently extend the aforementioned correspondence, structural decomposition and recovery map to arbitrary pairs of states and conditional expectations. As an application of the correspondence, we find the first family of states with non-vanishing conditional mutual information for which it decays superexponentially fast with the size of the middle system.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on the d'Alembertian from general relativity. An invitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey has multiple objectives. First, we motivate and review a new distributional notion of the d'Alembertian from mathematical relativity, more precisely, a nonlinear $p$-version thereof, where $p$ is a nonzero number less than one. This operator comes from natural Lagrangian actions introduced relatively recently. Unlike its classical linear yet hyperbolic counterpart, it is nonlinear yet has elliptic characteristics. Second, we describe recent comparison estimates for the $p$-d'Alembertian of Lorentz distance functions (notably a point or a spacelike hypersurface). Their new contribution implied by prior works on optimal transport through spacetime is a control of the timelike cut locus. Third, we illustrate exact representation formulas for these $p$-d'Alembertians employing methods from convex geometry. Fourth, several applications and open problems are presented.</description>

      <title>Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-R\'enyi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.</description>

      <title>DGenNO: A Novel Physics-aware Neural Operator for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems based on Deep, Generative Probabilistic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) and associated PDE-based, inverse problems is a central task in engineering and physics, yet existing neural operator methods struggle with high-dimensional, discontinuous inputs and require large amounts of {\em labeled} training data. We propose the Deep Generative Neural Operator (DGenNO), a physics-aware framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging a deep, generative, probabilistic model in combination with a set of lower-dimensional, latent variables that simultaneously encode PDE-inputs and PDE-outputs. This formulation can make use of unlabeled data and significantly improves inverse problem-solving, particularly for discontinuous or discrete-valued input functions. DGenNO enforces physics constraints without labeled data by incorporating as virtual observables, weak-form residuals based on compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs). These relax regularity constraints and eliminate higher-order derivatives from the objective function. We also introduce MultiONet, a novel neural operator architecture, which is a more expressive generalization of the popular DeepONet that significantly enhances the approximating power of the proposed model. These innovations make DGenNO particularly effective for challenging forward and inverse, PDE-based problems, such as those involving multi-phase media. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DGenNO achieves higher accuracy across multiple benchmarks while exhibiting robustness to noise and strong generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Its adaptability, and the ability to handle sparse, noisy data while providing probabilistic estimates, make DGenNO a powerful tool for scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>The formation of a soliton gas condensate for the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a rigorous analysis of a multi-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation as the number, $N$, of solitons grows to infinity. We discover configurations of $N$-soliton solutions which exhibit the formation (as $N \to \infty$) of a soliton gas condensate. Specifically, we show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane with norming constants bounded away from $0$, then, asymptotically, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity, on compact subsets of $(x,t)$. We then consider more complex solutions with an extra soliton component, and provide rigorous justification of the predictions of the kinetic theory of solitons in this deterministic setting. This is to be distinguished from previous analyses of soliton gasses where the norming constants were tending to zero with $N$, and the asymptotic description only included elliptic waves in the long-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Diffusivity of the Lorentz mirror walk in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Lorentz mirror walk in dimension $d\geq 2$, mirrors are randomly placed on the vertices of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ at density $p\in[0,1]$. A light ray is then shot from the origin and deflected through the various mirrors in space. The object of study is the random trajectory obtained in this way, and it is of upmost interest to determine whether these trajectories are localized (finite) or delocalized (infinite). A folklore conjecture states that for $d=2$ these trajectories are finite for any density $p&gt;0$, while in dimensions $d\geq 3$ and for $p&gt;0$ small enough some trajectories are infinite. In this paper we prove that for all dimensions $d\geq 4$ and any small density $p$, the trajectories behave diffusively at all polynomial time scales $t\approx p^{-M}$ with $M&gt;1$, and in particular, they do not close by this time.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood. Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum -observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces. Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Effective criteria for entanglement witnesses in small dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an effective set of necessary and sufficient criteria for block-positivity of matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{C}$. The approach is based on Sturm sequences and quartic polynomial positivity conditions presented in recent literature. The procedure allows us to test whether a given $4\times 4$ complex matrix corresponds to an entanglement witness, and it is exact when the matrix coefficients belong to the rationals, extended by $\mathrm{i}$. The method can be generalized to $\mathcal{H}_2\otimes\mathcal{H}_d$ systems for $d&gt;2$ to provide necessary but not sufficient criterion for block-positivity. We also outline an alternative approach to the problem relying on Gr\"obner bases.</description>

      <title>An alternative interpretation of the Grioli gyroscope suspension points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of all possible regular precessions of a heavy asymmetric body with a fixed point not coinciding with the center of mass. The calculations are done in terms of the rotation matrix, by writing the Euler-Poisson equations with all involved vectors parameterized in the Laboratory frame. It is shown that a regular precession is possible if the suspension point is chosen on the straight lines (lying in the principal plane) which are frontiers of the regions where, as the distance from the center of mass increases, the permutation of intermediate and largest moments of inertia occurs. Like the spin of an electron in quantum mechanics, the frequency of regular precession in classical mechanics turns out to be rigidly fixed by two values, i.e., quantized.</description>
