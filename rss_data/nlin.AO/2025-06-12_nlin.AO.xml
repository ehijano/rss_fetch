      <title>Phase-Space Engineering and Dynamical Long-Range Order in Memcomputing</title>

Abstract: Digital Memcomputing machines (DMMs) are dynamical systems with memory (time non-locality) that have been designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Their corresponding ordinary differential equations depend on a few hyper-parameters that define both the system's relevant time scales and its phase-space geometry. Using numerical simulations on a prototypical DMM, we analyze the role of these physical parameters in engineering the phase space to either help or hinder the solution search by DMMs. We find that the DMM explores its phase space efficiently for a wide range of parameters, aided by the long-range correlations in their fast degrees of freedom that emerge dynamically due to coupling with the (slow) memory degrees of freedom. In this regime, the time it takes for the system to find a solution scales well as the number of variables increases. When these hyper-parameters are chosen poorly, the system navigates its phase space far less efficiently. However, we find that, in many cases, dynamical long-range order (DLRO) persists even when the phase-space exploration process is inefficient. DLRO only disappears if the memories are made to evolve as quickly as the fast degrees of freedom. This study points to the important role of memory and hyper-parameters in engineering the DMMs' phase space for optimal computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>The pursuit of happiness</title>

Abstract: Happiness, in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, was understood quite differently from today's popular notions of personal pleasure. Happiness implies a flourishing life - one of virtue, purpose, and contribution to the common good. This paper studies populations of individuals - that we call homo-felix - who maximise an objective function that we call happiness. The happiness of one individual depends on the payoffs that they receive in games they play with their peers as well as on the happiness of the peers they interact with. Individuals care more or less about others depending on whether that makes them more or less happy. This paper analyses the happiness feedback loops that result from these interactions in simple settings. We find that individuals tend to care more about individuals who are happier than what they would be by being selfish. In simple 2 x 2 game theoretic settings, we show that homo-felix can converge to a variety of equilibria which includes but goes beyond Nash equilibria. In an n-persons public good game we show that the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is marginally unstable and a single individual who develops prosocial behaviour is able to drive almost the whole population to a cooperative state.</description>

      <title>How much regulation do we need from genomes to society?</title>

Abstract: Regulatory functions are essential in both socioeconomic and biological systems, from corporate managers to regulatory genes. Regulatory functions come with substantial costs and benefits, and the balance of the two is often taken for granted. A fundamental question for all complex systems becomes how much regulatory function do they need for their size and function? Here, we present empirical evidence that regulatory functions scale systematically across diverse systems: biological organisms (bacterial and eukaryotic genomes), human organizations (companies, federal agencies, universities), and decentralized entities (Wikipedia, cities). We combine an analysis of large data sets from each of these domains with a simple conceptual model. The model predicts that the scaling of regulatory costs shifts with system structure. Well-mixed small systems exhibit superlinear scaling between size and regulatory function, while modular large ones show sublinear or linear scaling, both in agreement with data. Finally, we find that socioeconomic systems that contain more diverse occupational functions tend to have more regulatory costs than expected from the scaling relationships, confirming the hypothesis that the type and complexity of interactions also play a role in regulatory costs. Our cross-system comparison offers a mechanistic framework for understanding regulatory function and can potentially guide efforts to analyze the costs and benefits of regulatory function in diverse systems.</description>
