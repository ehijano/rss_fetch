      <title>Multi-objective Memetic Algorithm with Adaptive Weights for Inverse Antenna Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the modification of a single-objective algorithm into its multi-objective counterpart. The outcome is a considerable increase in speed in the order of tens to hundreds and the resulting Pareto front is of higher quality compared to conventional state-of-the-art automated inverse design setups. This advancement is possible thanks to a memetic algorithm combining a gradient-based search for local minima with heuristic optimization to maintain sufficient diversity. The local algorithm is based on rank-1 perturbations; the global algorithm is NSGA-II. An important advancement is the adaptive weighting of objective functions during optimization. The procedure is tested on three challenging examples dealing with both physical and topological metrics and multi-objective settings. The results are compared with standard techniques, and the superb performance of the proposed technique is reported. The implemented algorithm applies to antenna inverse design problems and is an efficient data miner for machine learning tools.</description>

      <title>Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) for solving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) more accurately, robustly and faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using "square of ReLU" as the basis of its activation functions has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higher-order-ReLU, which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, B-splines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential for physics-informed neural networks. Our detailed experiments on two standard and typical PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLUKANs and HRKANs.</description>

      <title>A Neuromorphic Implementation of the DBSCAN Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DBSCAN is an algorithm that performs clustering in the presence of noise. In this paper, we provide two constructions that allow DBSCAN to be implemented neuromorphically, using spiking neural networks. The first construction is termed "flat," resulting in large spiking neural networks that compute the algorithm quickly, in five timesteps. Moreover, the networks allow pipelining, so that a new DBSCAN calculation may be performed every timestep. The second construction is termed "systolic", and generates much smaller networks, but requires the inputs to be spiked in over several timesteps, column by column. We provide precise specifications of the constructions and analyze them in practical neuromorphic computing settings. We also provide an open-source implementation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Feature Selection with Genetic Algorithms: A Review of Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing large datasets to select optimal features is one of the most important research areas in machine learning and data mining. This feature selection procedure involves dimensionality reduction which is crucial in enhancing the performance of the model, making it less complex. Recently, several types of attribute selection methods have been proposed that use different approaches to obtain representative subsets of the attributes. However, population-based evolutionary algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been proposed to provide remedies for these drawbacks by avoiding local optima and improving the selection process itself. This manuscript presents a sweeping review on GA-based feature selection techniques in applications and their effectiveness across different domains. This review was conducted using the PRISMA methodology; hence, the systematic identification, screening, and analysis of relevant literature were performed. Thus, our results hint that the field's hybrid GA methodologies including, but not limited to, GA-Wrapper feature selector and HGA-neural networks, have substantially improved their potential through the resolution of problems such as exploration of unnecessary search space, accuracy performance problems, and complexity. The conclusions of this paper would result in discussing the potential that GAs bear in feature selection and future research directions for their enhancement in applicability and performance.</description>

      <title>A Realistic Simulation Framework for Analog/Digital Neuromorphic Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing dedicated neuromorphic computing platforms optimized for embedded or edge-computing applications requires time-consuming design, fabrication, and deployment of full-custom neuromorphic processors.bTo ensure that initial prototyping efforts, exploring the properties of different network architectures and parameter settings, lead to realistic results it is important to use simulation frameworks that match as best as possible the properties of the final hardware. This is particularly challenging for neuromorphic hardware platforms made using mixed-signal analog/digital circuits, due to the variability and noise sensitivity of their components. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a software spiking neural network simulator explicitly designed to account for the properties of mixed-signal neuromorphic circuits, including device mismatch variability. The simulator, called ARCANA (A Realistic Simulation Framework for Analog/Digital Neuromorphic Architectures), is designed to reproduce the dynamics of mixed-signal synapse and neuron electronic circuits with autogradient differentiation for parameter optimization and GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by matching software simulation results with measurements made from an existing neuromorphic processor. We show how the results obtained provide a reliable estimate of the behavior of the spiking neural network trained in software, once deployed in hardware. This framework enables the development and innovation of new learning rules and processing architectures in neuromorphic embedded systems.</description>

      <title>More Consideration for the Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13854v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the gated perceptron, an enhancement of the conventional perceptron, which incorporates an additional input computed as the product of the existing inputs. This allows the perceptron to capture non-linear interactions between features, significantly improving its ability to classify and regress on complex datasets. We explore its application in both linear and non-linear regression tasks using the Iris dataset, as well as binary and multi-class classification problems, including the PIMA Indian dataset and Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Our results demonstrate that the gated perceptron can generate more distinct decision regions compared to traditional perceptrons, enhancing its classification capabilities, particularly in handling non-linear data. Performance comparisons show that the gated perceptron competes with state-of-the-art classifiers while maintaining a simple architecture.</description>

      <title>Challenging the Performance-Interpretability Trade-off: An Evaluation of Interpretable Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is permeating every conceivable domain to promote data-driven decision support. The focus is often on advanced black-box models due to their assumed performance advantages, whereas interpretable models are often associated with inferior predictive qualities. More recently, however, a new generation of generalized additive models (GAMs) has been proposed that offer promising properties for capturing complex, non-linear patterns while remaining fully interpretable. To uncover the merits and limitations of these models, this study examines the predictive performance of seven different GAMs in comparison to seven commonly used machine learning models based on a collection of twenty tabular benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair and robust model comparison, an extensive hyperparameter search combined with cross-validation was performed, resulting in 68,500 model runs. In addition, this study qualitatively examines the visual output of the models to assess their level of interpretability. Based on these results, the paper dispels the misconception that only black-box models can achieve high accuracy by demonstrating that there is no strict trade-off between predictive performance and model interpretability for tabular data. Furthermore, the paper discusses the importance of GAMs as powerful interpretable models for the field of information systems and derives implications for future work from a socio-technical perspective.</description>

      <title>A Diagonal Structured State Space Model on Loihi 2 for Efficient Streaming Sequence Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep State-Space Models (SSM) demonstrate state-of-the art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. While the recurrent structure of SSMs can be efficiently implemented as a convolution or as a parallel scan during training, recurrent token-by-token processing cannot currently be implemented efficiently on GPUs. Here, we demonstrate efficient token-by-token inference of the SSM S4D on Intel's Loihi 2 state-of-the-art neuromorphic processor. We compare this first ever neuromorphic-hardware implementation of an SSM on sMNIST, psMNIST, and sCIFAR to a recurrent and a convolutional implementation of S4D on Jetson Orin Nano (Jetson). While we find Jetson to perform better in an offline sample-by-sample based batched processing mode, Loihi 2 outperforms during token-by-token based processing, where it consumes 1000 times less energy with a 75 times lower latency and a 75 times higher throughput compared to the recurrent implementation of S4D on Jetson. This opens up new avenues towards efficient real-time streaming applications of SSMs.</description>

      <title>A Gated Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Mixtures of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces KAMoE, a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework based on Gated Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (GRKAN). We propose GRKAN as an alternative to the traditional gating function, aiming to enhance efficiency and interpretability in MoE modeling. Through extensive experiments on digital asset markets and real estate valuation, we demonstrate that KAMoE consistently outperforms traditional MoE architectures across various tasks and model types. Our results show that GRKAN exhibits superior performance compared to standard Gating Residual Networks, particularly in LSTM-based models for sequential tasks. We also provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains in MoE and KAMoE architectures.</description>

      <title>Improved Robustness and Hyperparameter Selection in the Dense Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dense Associative Memory generalizes the Hopfield network by allowing for sharper interaction functions. This increases the capacity of the network as an autoassociative memory as nearby learned attractors will not interfere with one another. However, the implementation of the network relies on applying large exponents to the dot product of memory vectors and probe vectors. If the dimension of the data is large the calculation can be very large and result in imprecisions and overflow when using floating point numbers in a practical implementation. We describe the computational issues in detail, modify the original network description to mitigate the problem, and show the modification will not alter the networks' dynamics during update or training. We also show our modification greatly improves hyperparameter selection for the Dense Associative Memory, removing dependence on the interaction vertex and resulting in an optimal region of hyperparameters that does not significantly change with the interaction vertex as it does in the original network.</description>

      <title>Using the Empirical Attainment Function for Analyzing Single-objective Black-box Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely accepted way to assess the performance of iterative black-box optimizers is to analyze their empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of pre-defined quality targets achieved not later than a given runtime. In this work, we consider an alternative approach, based on the empirical attainment function (EAF) and we show that the target-based ECDF is an approximation of the EAF. We argue that the EAF has several advantages over the target-based ECDF. In particular, it does not require defining a priori quality targets per function, captures performance differences more precisely, and enables the use of additional summary statistics that enrich the analysis. We also show that the average area over the convergence curves is a simpler-to-calculate, but equivalent, measure of anytime performance. To facilitate the accessibility of the EAF, we integrate a module to compute it into the IOHanalyzer platform. Finally, we illustrate the use of the EAF via synthetic examples and via the data available for the BBOB suite.</description>

      <title>Neural units with time-dependent functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the time-resolved dynamics of an underdamped harmonic oscillator can be used to do multifunctional computation, performing distinct computations at distinct times within a single dynamical trajectory. We consider the amplitude of an oscillator whose inputs influence its frequency. The activity of the oscillator at fixed time is a nonmonotonic function of its inputs, and so it can solve problems such as XOR that are not linearly separable. The activity of the oscillator at fixed input is a nonmonotonic function of time, and so it is multifunctional in a temporal sense, able to carry out distinct nonlinear computations at distinct times within the same dynamical trajectory. We show that a single oscillator, observed at different times, can act as all of the elementary logic gates and can perform binary addition, the latter usually implemented in hardware using 5 logic gates. We show that a set of $n$ oscillators, observed at different times, can perform an arbitrary number of analog-to-$n$-bit digital conversions. We also show that oscillators can be trained by gradient descent to perform distinct classification tasks at distinct times. Computing with time-dependent functionality can be done in or out of equilibrium, and suggests a way of reducing the number of parameters or devices required to do nonlinear computations.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Traffic Flow using Wavelet-based Temporal Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting of traffic flow data represents a typical problem in the field of machine learning, impacting urban traffic management systems. In general, spatiotemporal forecasting problems involve complex interactions, nonlinearities, and long-range dependencies due to the interwoven nature of the temporal and spatial dimensions. Due to this, traditional statistical and machine learning methods cannot adequately handle the temporal and spatial dependencies in these complex traffic flow datasets. A prevalent approach in the field combines graph convolutional networks and multi-head attention mechanisms for spatiotemporal processing. This paper proposes a wavelet-based temporal attention model, namely a wavelet-based dynamic spatiotemporal aware graph neural network (W-DSTAGNN), for tackling the traffic forecasting problem. Wavelet decomposition can help by decomposing the signal into components that can be analyzed independently, reducing the impact of non-stationarity and handling long-range dependencies of traffic flow datasets. Benchmark experiments using three popularly used statistical metrics confirm that our proposal efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations and outperforms ten state-of-the-art models (including both temporal and spatiotemporal benchmarks) on three publicly available traffic datasets. Our proposed ensemble method can better handle dynamic temporal and spatial dependencies and make reliable long-term forecasts. In addition to point forecasts, our proposed model can generate interval forecasts that significantly enhance probabilistic forecasting for traffic datasets.</description>
