      <title>First experimental observation of zonal flows in the optimized stellarator Wendelstein 7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first experimental evidence of the presence of zonal flow (ZF) structures in the optimized stellarator Wendelstein 7-X. Using an assortment of diagnostics, flux surface-uniform, electrostatic flow oscillations have been measured, showing a radial scale in the range of tens of ion gyroradii. Such measurements show remarkable agreement with the ZF predicted by local and global non-linear gyrokinetic simulations. These results represent the first direct measurement of ZF in a large stellarator, suitable for the validation of models in reactor relevant conditions.</description>

      <title>Waveshape of THz radiation produced by two-color laser-induced air plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial and spectral distributions of terahertz (THz) pulses emitted by two-color air plasmas are theoretically investigated for focused laser pulses and in the filamentation regime. We derive a so-called ''augmented'' conical emission model, which, similarly to the one originally proposed by You et al.\ [Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ {\bf 109}, 183902 (2012)], involves phase matching between laser harmonics along the plasma channel, the plasma density and length, and the emitted frequency as key parameters. Our augmented model, however, treats envelope effects and accounts for transverse variations of both plasma- and Kerr-driven potential THz emitters. We highlight the importance of the characteristic spatio-spectral distributions of these two conversion mechanisms in the expression of the angular radiated power. The results of our model are successfully compared with data provided by a comprehensive, fully space and time-resolved unidirectional solver. Importantly, these numerical simulations clear up the effective plasma length along which THz emission develops, compared with the dephasing length along which the laser fundamental and second harmonic become out-of-phase. The impact of common optical aberrations, such as sphericity, astigmatism, and coma, on the THz generation is also investigated. Aberrations are shown to generally decrease the laser-to-THz conversion efficiency and potentially induce spatial asymmetries and narrowing in the THz spectra.</description>

      <title>Fundamental constants from photon-photon scattering in three-beam collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the elastic scattering of real photons on an electromagnetic field would allow the fundamental low-energy constants of quantum electrodynamics (QED) to be experimentally determined. We show that scenarios involving the collision of three laser beams have several advantages over conventional two-beam scenarios. The kinematics of a three-beam collision allows for a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the detection region, without the need for polarimetry and separates out contributions from different orders of photon scattering. A planar configuration of colliding a photon beam from an x-ray free electron laser with two optical beams is studied in detail. We show that measurements of elastic photon scattering and vacuum birefringence are possible with currently available technology.</description>

      <title>Plasma Surrogate Modelling using Fourier Neural Operators</title>

Abstract: Predicting plasma evolution within a Tokamak reactor is crucial to realizing the goal of sustainable fusion. Capabilities in forecasting the spatio-temporal evolution of plasma rapidly and accurately allow us to quickly iterate over design and control strategies on current Tokamak devices and future reactors. Modelling plasma evolution using numerical solvers is often expensive, consuming many hours on supercomputers, and hence, we need alternative inexpensive surrogate models. We demonstrate accurate predictions of plasma evolution both in simulation and experimental domains using deep learning-based surrogate modelling tools, viz., Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). We show that FNO has a speedup of six orders of magnitude over traditional solvers in predicting the plasma dynamics simulated from magnetohydrodynamic models, while maintaining a high accuracy (MSE in the normalised domain $\approx$ $10^{-5}$). Our modified version of the FNO is capable of solving multi-variable Partial Differential Equations (PDE), and can capture the dependence among the different variables in a single model. FNOs can also predict plasma evolution on real-world experimental data observed by the cameras positioned within the MAST Tokamak, i.e., cameras looking across the central solenoid and the divertor in the Tokamak. We show that FNOs are able to accurately forecast the evolution of plasma and have the potential to be deployed for real-time monitoring. We also illustrate their capability in forecasting the plasma shape, the locations of interactions of the plasma with the central solenoid and the divertor for the full (available) duration of the plasma shot within MAST. The FNO offers a viable alternative for surrogate modelling as it is quick to train and infer, and requires fewer data points, while being able to do zero-shot super-resolution and getting high-fidelity solutions.</description>

      <title>Temperature inversion in a confined plasma atmosphere: coarse-grained effect of temperature fluctuations at its base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompted by the relevant problem of temperature inversion (i.e. gradient of density anti-correlated to the gradient of temperature) in astrophysics, we introduce a novel method to model a gravitationally confined multi-component collisionless plasma in contact with a fluctuating thermal boundary. We focus on systems with anti-correlated (inverted) density and temperature profiles, with applications to solar physics. The dynamics of the plasma is analytically described via the coupling of an appropriated coarse-grained distribution function and temporally coarse-grained Vlasov dynamics. We derive a stationary solution of the system and predict the inverted density and temperature profiles of the two-species for scenarios relevant for the corona. We validate our method by comparing the analytical results with kinetic numerical simulations of the plasma dynamics in the context of the two-species Hamiltonian mean-field model (HMF). Finally, we apply our theoretical framework to the problem of the temperature inversion in the solar corona obtaining density and temperature profiles in remarkably good agreement with the observations.</description>

      <title>Progress in Electron Energy Modeling for Hypersonic Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11052v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel formulation of the electron energy relaxation terms is presented here, which is applicable to high-speed plasma flows and discharges wherein the electron temperature could be higher or lower than the gas temperature. It is demonstrated that the electron energy losses due to inelastic collisions can be expressed as a function of only two species-dependent parameters: the reduced electric field and the reduced electron mobility. This formulation is advantageous over previous ones, being simpler to implement and more accurate when experimental data of the reduced electric field and reduced mobility are available. Curve fits to empirical data of these two properties are outlined here for all important air molecular species. The approach accounts for all inelastic electron energy relaxation processes without needing individual cross-sections or rates, reducing potential errors associated with independently handling each process. Several test cases are presented to validate the proposed electron energy source terms including hypersonic plasma flows for which the electron temperature is less than the gas temperature, as well as discharges in which the electron temperature reaches values in excess of 30 eV. In all cases, the agreement with experimental data is observed to be very good to excellent, significantly surpassing prior electron energy models for high-speed flows.</description>

      <title>Plasma stratification in AC discharges in noble gases at low currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid kinetic-fluid model is used to study plasma stratification in alternating current (AC) discharges in noble gases at low plasma densities. Self-consistent coupled solutions of a non-local kinetic equation for electrons, a drift-diffusion equation of ions, and a Poisson equation for the electric field are obtained for a positive column with periodic boundary conditions and for the entire discharge to study near-electrode effects within a 1d model with radial ambipolar loss. A simplified two-level excitation-ionization model neglects the nonlinear effects due to stepwise ionization, gas heating, and Coulomb interactions among electrons. Standing striations are obtained for the reduced values of electric fields corresponding to the inelastic energy balance of electrons in a range of driving frequencies. An analog of Novak law (striation length proportional to the excitation threshold of atoms and inversely proportional to the mean square root of the electric field) is observed in simulations, indicating the nonlocal nature of standing striations in AC discharges at low plasma densities. Stratified plasma operates in a dynamic regime for a wide range of driving frequencies because heat conduction occurs much faster than the ambipolar diffusion controlled by slow ion motion. We demonstrate that standing striations in symmetric AC discharges previously observed in experiments are similar to moving striations in DC discharges and are both due to nonlocal kinetic effects at low discharge currents.</description>

      <title>Natural-linewidth measurements of the 3C and 3D soft-x-ray transitions in Ni XIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We used the monochromatic soft-x-ray beamline P04 at the synchrotron-radiation facility PETRA III to resonantly excite the strongest $2p-3d$ transitions in neon-like Ni XIX ions, $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{1/2}\,3d_{3/2}]_{J=1}$ and $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{3/2}\,3d_{5/2}]_{J=1}$, respectively dubbed 3C and 3D, achieving a resolving power of 15\,000 and signal-to-background ratio of 30. We obtain their natural linewidths, with an accuracy of better than 10\%, as well as the oscillator-strength ratio $f(3C)/f(3D)$ = 2.51(11) from analysis of the resonant fluorescence spectra. These results agree with those of previous experiments, earlier predictions, and our own advanced calculations.</description>

      <title>Parametric decay instability of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave in magnetically dominated plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate parametric decay instability (PDI) of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave into daughter acoustic wave and backward Alfv\'en wave in magnetically-dominated plasma, in which the magnetization parameter $\sigma$ (energy density ratio of background magnetic field to matter) exceeds unity. We analyze relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), focusing on wave frequencies sufficiently lower than the plasma and cyclotron frequencies. We derive analytical formulae for the dispersion relation and growth rate of the instability as a function of the magnetization $\sigma$, wave amplitude $\eta$, and plasma temperature $\theta$. We find that PDI persists even in high magnetization $\sigma$, albeit with a decreased growth rate up to $\sigma\to\infty$. Our formulae are useful for estimating the decay of Alfv\'en wave into acoustic wave and heat in high magnetization $\sigma$ plasma, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon such as in pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts.</description>
