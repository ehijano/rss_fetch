      <title>Laser cooling $^{88}$Sr to microkelvin temperature with an integrated-photonics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on experiments generating a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of 88-strontium ($^{88}$Sr) atoms at microkelvin temperature, using integrated-photonics devices. With metasurface optics integrated on a fused-silica substrate, we generate six-beam, circularly polarized, counter-propagating MOTs on the blue broad-line, 461 nm, and red narrow-line, 689 nm, Sr cooling transitions without bulk optics. By use of a diverging beam configuration, we create up to 10 mm diameter MOT beams at the trapping location. To frequency stabilize and linewidth narrow the cooling lasers, we use fiber-packaged, integrated nonlinear waveguides to spectrally broaden a frequency comb. The ultra-coherent supercontinuum of the waveguides covers 650 nm to 2500 nm, enabling phase locks of the cooling lasers to hertz level linewidth. Our work highlights the possibility to simplify the preparation of an ultracold 88Sr gas for an optical-lattice clock with photonic devices. By implementing a timing sequence for control of the MOT lasers and the quadrupole magnetic-field gradient, we collect atoms directly from a thermal beam into the blue MOT and continuously cool into a red MOT with dynamic detuning and intensity control. There, the red MOT temperature is as low as $2~{\mu}$K and the overall transfer efficiency up to 16%. We characterize this sequence, including an intermediate red MOT with modulated detuning. Our experiments demonstrate an integrated photonics system capable of cooling alkaline-earth gases to microkelvin temperature with sufficient transfer efficiencies for adoption in scalable optical clocks and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Effects of higher-order Casimir-Polder interactions on Rydberg atom spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the extreme near-field, when the spatial extension of the atomic wavefunction is no longer negligible compared to the atom-surface distance, the dipole approximation is no longer sufficient to describe Casimir-Polder interactions. Here we calculate the higher-order, quadrupole and octupole, contributions to Casimir-Polder energy shifts of Rydberg atoms close to a dielectric surface. We subsequently investigate the effects of these higher-order terms in thin-cell and selective reflection spectroscopy. Beyond its fundamental interest, this new regime of extremely small atom surface separations is relevant for quantum technology applications with Rydberg or surface-bound atoms interfacing with photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Isotope shift factors with quantum electrodynamics effects for many-electron systems: A study of the nuclear charge radius of $^{26m}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for calculating the field shift contribution to isotope shifts in many-electron atoms, incorporating quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects, is introduced. We also implement the model QED approach to incorporate QED contribution to the nuclear recoil effect at the high-order correlation effects treatment level. The proposed computational scheme is used to revise the value of the root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radius of the isomer of aluminium-26, $^{26m}$Al. This radius is important for the global analysis of the $V_{ud}$ element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. The difference in mean-square nuclear charge radii of $^{27}$Al and $^{26m}$Al, obtained by combining the calculated atomic factors with recently measured isotope shift (IS) of the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in Al, is $0.443(44)(19)~{\rm fm}^2$, where the first and second uncertainties are experimental and theoretical ones, respectively. The latter is reduced by a factor of 4 with respect to the previous study. Using this value and the known value of the rms charge radius of $^{27}$Al, the resultant value $R_c(^{26m}$Al) = 3.132(10)~fm is obtained. With the improved accuracy of the calculated IS factors the error in $R_c(^{26m}$Al) is now dominated by the experimental uncertainty. Similar revision of rms charge radii is made for the $^{28}$Al, $^{29}$Al, $^{30}$Al, $^{31}$Al and $^{32}$Al isotopes using existing IS measurements. Additionally, atomic factors are computed for the {$3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$}, {$3s^23p~^2P_{1/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$} and {$3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$} transitions in Al, which can be used in future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Laser Frequency Stabilization Using Light Shift in Compact Atomic Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the Light-Shift Laser-Lock (LSLL) technique, a novel method intended for compact atomic clocks that greatly simplifies the laser setup by stabilizing the pumping-laser frequency to the atoms involved in the clock, without the need of an external reference. By alternating two clock sequences with different light shifts, the method estimates and cancels out a controlled amount of induced light shift, acting on the laser frequency. The LSLL technique is compatible with state-of-the-art 3-level clocks and was demonstrated with FPGA-based electronics on a pulsed-optically-pumped (POP) vapor-cell clock developed at INRIM. The results have shown that the LSLL technique operates robustly, having a capture range of gigahertz without significantly compromising clock stability. In our tests, the clock exhibited a white frequency noise of $3.2 \times 10^{-13}$ $\tau^{-1/2}$ for averaging time up to 4000 s, reaching a floor below $1 \times 10^{-14}$ up to 100 000 s. These performance levels meet the requirements of future Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) on-board clocks, and offer the added benefits of a reduced clock footprint, as well as increased reliability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Multielectron effect in strong-field ionization of CO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the multielectron polarization of the ion described by the induced dipole potential in photoelectron momentum distributions produced in ionization of the CO molecule by a strong laser field. We present results of the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation in three spatial dimensions and semiclassical simulations accounting for quantum interference. We predict the change of the asymmetry and interference patterns in two-dimensional photoelectron momentum distributions as well as longitudinal momentum distributions. By using a semiclassical model we identify the mechanism responsible for the observed effects. It is shown that the modifications of electron momentum distributions are caused by a combined effect of the force acting on photoelectrons due to the induced dipole potential and the linear Stark-shift of the ionization potential.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous action of a single photon at two remote places</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Einstein's thought experiment that a single quantum particle diffracted after a pinhole could in principle produce an action in two or several places on a hemispherical imaging screen, here we explore theoretically the possibility to simultaneously detect the action of a single photon at two remote places. This is considered in a cascade quantum system composed of two spatially distant cavities each coupled to a qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single-photon pulse incident on the two cavities can simultaneously excite the two remote qubits and lead to two subsequent detection events even when the separation between them is comparable to the spatial length of the photon pulse. Our results not only uncover new facets of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level but also have practical applications, such as the generation of remote entanglement through a dissipative channel which is otherwise unattainable in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic sapphire optical reference cavity with crystalline coatings at $\mathrm{ 1 \times 10^{-16}}$ fractional instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency stability of a laser locked to an optical reference cavity is fundamentally limited by thermal noise in the cavity length. These fluctuations are linked to material dissipation, which depends both on the temperature of the optical components and the material properties. Here, the design and experimental characterization of a sapphire optical cavity operated at 10 K with crystalline coatings at 1069 nm is presented. Theoretical estimates of the thermo-mechanical noise indicate a thermal noise floor below $\mathrm{4.5\times10^{-18}}$. Major technical noise contributions including vibrations, temperature fluctuations, and residual amplitude modulation are characterized in detail. The short-term performance is measured via a three-cornered hat analysis with two other cavity-stabilized lasers, yielding a noise floor of $1\times10^{-16}$. The long-term performance is measured against an optical lattice clock, indicating cavity stability at the level of $2\times10^{-15}$ for averaging times up to 10,000 s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a sensitive optically-pumped magnetometer using rubidium vapor and 0.75 amg of nitrogen buffer gas in a sub-mm-width sensing channel excavated by femtosecond laser writing followed by chemical etching. The channel is buried less than 1 mm below the surface of its fused silica host material, which also includes reservoir chambers and micro-strainer connections, to preserve a clean optical environment. Using a zero-field-resonance magnetometry strategy and a sensing volume of 2.25 mm$^3$, we demonstrate a sensitivity of $\approx$ 1 $\mathrm{pT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at $10$ Hz. The device can be integrated with photonic structures and microfluidic channels with 3D versatility. Its sensitivity, bandwidth and stand-off distance will enable detection of localized fields from magnetic nanoparticles and \mul NMR samples.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of tunneling times promoted by Ramsey clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What time does a clock tell after quantum tunneling? Predictions and indirect measurements range from superluminal or instantaneous tunneling to finite durations, depending on the specific experiment and the precise definition of the elapsed time. Proposals and implementations utilize the atomic motion to define this delay, even though the inherent quantum nature of atoms implies a delocalization and is in sharp contrast to classical trajectories. Here, we rely on an operational approach: we prepare atoms in a coherent superposition of internal states and study the time read off via a Ramsey sequence after the tunneling process without the notion of classical trajectories or velocities. Our operational framework (a) unifies definitions of tunneling delay within one approach; (b) connects the time to a frequency standard given by a conventional atomic clock which can be boosted by differential light shifts; and (c) highlights that there exists no superluminal or instantaneous tunneling.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory describing interaction of structured light, such as light carrying orbital angular momentum, with molecules. The light-matter interaction Hamiltonian we derive is expressed through couplings between spherical gradients of the electric field and the (transition) multipole moments of a particle of any non-trivial rotation point group. Our model can therefore accommodate for an arbitrary complexity of the molecular and electric field structure, and can be straightforwardly extended to atoms or nanostructures. Applying this framework to ro-vibrational spectroscopy of molecules, we uncover the general mechanism of angular momentum exchange between the spin and orbital angular momenta of light, molecular rotation and its center-of-mass motion. We show that the non-zero vorticity of Laguerre-Gaussian beams can strongly enhance certain ro-vibrational transitions that are considered forbidden in the case of non-helical light. We discuss the experimental requirements for the observation of these forbidden transitions in state-of-the-art spatially-resolved spectroscopy measurements.</description>

      <title>Irreversible entropy transport enhanced by fermionic superfluidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of particle and entropy flow between two superfluids is often understood in terms of reversible flow carried by an entropy-free, macroscopic wavefunction. While this wavefunction is responsible for many intriguing properties of superfluids and superconductors, its interplay with excitations in non-equilibrium situations is less understood. Here, we observe large concurrent flows of both particles and entropy through a ballistic channel connecting two strongly interacting fermionic superfluids. Both currents respond nonlinearly to chemical potential and temperature biases. We find that the entropy transported per particle is much larger than the prediction of superfluid hydrodynamics in the linear regime and largely independent of changes in the channel's geometry. In contrast, the timescales of advective and diffusive entropy transport vary significantly with the channel geometry. In our setting, superfluidity counterintuitively increases the speed of entropy transport. Moreover, we develop a phenomenological model describing the nonlinear dynamics within the framework of generalised gradient dynamics. Our approach for measuring entropy currents may help elucidate mechanisms of heat transfer in superfluids and superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Coherently controlling robust spin-orbit qubits of electrons in nanowire quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an electron confined in a gated nanowire quantum dot (NQD) with arbitrarily strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and weak static magnetic field, and treat the latter as a perturbation to seek the maximal spin-motion entangled states with the exact general solutions of the perturbed equations. From the boundedness and self-consistent conditions of the general solutions we find two corrected energies to any n level of the unperturbed system with ground state n = 0, which are much less than the unperturbed level-difference and corresponds to a spin-orbit qubit. We demonstrate the metastability of the two-level states and the decoherence-averse effect of SOC, and suggest an alternative scheme to perform the qubit control, simply by adjusting the orientation of magnetic field for any fixed SOC. Such a adjustment can lead to the spin flipping of the state vector and the position exchanging of the probability-density wavepackets which can be proposed as the non-Abelian quasiparticles. The results could be directly extended to a weakly coupled array of NQDs for coherently encoding the robust spin-orbit qubits.</description>
