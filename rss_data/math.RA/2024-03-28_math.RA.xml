      <title>On Unitification of $*$-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S. K. Berberian raised the open problem ``Can every weakly Rickart $*$-ring be embedded in a Rickart $*$-ring? with preservation of right projections?" Berberian has given a partial solution to this problem. Khairnar and Waphare raised a similar problem for p.q.-Baer $*$-rings and gave a partial solution. In this paper, we give more general partial solutions to both the problems.</description>

      <title>The structure of subalgebras of full matrix algebras over a field satisfying the identity [x_1, y_1][x_2, y_2] ... [x_q, y_q] = 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subalgebra of the full matrix algebra Mn(K), K a field, satisfying the identity [x1, y1][x2, y2]...[xq, yq] = 0 is called a Dq subalgebra of Mn(K). In the paper we deal with the structure, conjugation and isomorphism problems of maximal Dq subalgebras of Mn(K).
  We show that a maximal Dq subalgebra A of Mn(K) is conjugated with a block triangular subalgebra of Mn(K) with maximal commutative diagonal blocks. By analysis of conjugations, the sizes of the obtained diagonal blocks are uniquely determined. It reduces the problem of conjugation of maximal Dq subalgebras of Mn(K) to the analogous problem in the class of commutative subalgebras of Mn(K). Further examining conjugations, in case A is contained in the upper triangular matrix algebra Un(K), we prove that A is already in a block triangular form.
  We consider the isomorphism problem in a certain class of maximal Dq subalgebras of Mn(K) which contain all Dq subalgebras of Mn(K) with maximum dimension. In case K is algebraically closed, we invoke Jacobson's characterization of maximal commutative subalgebras of Mn(K) with maximum (K-)dimension to show that isomorphic subalgebras in this class are already conjugated. To illustrate it, we invoke results from [17] and find all isomorphism (equivalently conjugation) classes of Dq subalgebras of Mn(K) with maximum possible dimension, in case K is algebraically closed.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Jordan algebras of cubic forms. Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subsequent to the previous paper [Tak5], we are concerned with the classification of complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 which are produced, as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of certain affine varieties related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibrations. Such affine varieties or their appropriate weighted projectivizations (possibly allowing some coordinates have weights $0$) are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds.
  The purpose of this paper is to give new constructions of a $14$-dimensional affine variety $\Upsilon_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and a $15$-dimensional affine variety $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{15}$ related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibration, which were constructed and were shown to be key varieties in the papers [Tak3,Tak4] and [Tay]. It is well-known that the affine cone of the Segre embedded $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is defined as the null loci of the so called $\sharp$-mapping of a 9-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic Jordan algebra $J$ of a cubic form. Inspired with this fact, we construct $\Upsilon_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{15}$ in the same way coordinatizing $J$ with 9 and 10 parameters, respectively. The coordinatization with $9$ parameters is derived by using a fixed primitive idempotent, and the associated Peirce decomposition. The coordinatization with $10$ parameters is derived from the construction of a quadratic Jordan subalgebra generated by $\sharp$-products of two elements due to Petersson [Pe1].</description>

      <title>Quotients in super-symmetry: formal supergroup case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the structure of the quotient $\mathfrak{G}/\mathfrak{H}$ of a formal supergroup $\mathfrak{G}$ by its formal sub-supergroup $\mathfrak{H}$. This is a consequence which arises as a continuation of the authors' work (partly with M. Hashi) on algebraic/analytic supergoups.The results are presented and proved in terms of super-cocommutative Hopf superalgebras. The notion of co-free super-coalgebras plays a role, in particular.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay representations of invariant subrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Cohen-Macaulay representations of quotient singularities $R:=l[[x_1,\cdots,x_d]]^G$ where $l$ is a field and $G$ is a finite group acting on $l[[x_1,\cdots,x_d]]$ as a ring, not necessarily as an $l$-algebra, with $|G|$ not divided by ${\rm char}\, l$. In fact, if we put $k:=l^G$, then we may assume that $G$ is a subgroup of $GL_d(l)\rtimes{\rm Gal}(l/k)$. We show that $R$ has a generator giving an NCCR and therefore when $d=2$, it is of finite Cohen-Macaulay type. Additionally, we completely describe its Auslander-Reiten quiver, which is often non-simply laced, as a quotient of a certain quiver. Moreover, we also prove that two-dimensional rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type of equicharacteristic zero are precisely quotient singularities of this form, which generalizes Esnault and Auslander's result. Combining these results, we prove that the quivers that may arise as the Auslander-Reiten quiver of a two-dimensional Gorenstein ring of finite Cohen-Macaulay type of equicharacteristic zero are either doubles of extended Dynkin diagrams or ones having loops. To accomplish these, we establish two results which are of independent interest. First, we prove the existence of $(d-1)$-almost split sequences for arbitrary Cohen-Macaulay normal rings having NCCR which are not necessarily isolated singularities. Second, we make it possible to determine simple modules over skew group algebras by relating them to those over certain group algebras.</description>

      <title>Units of twisted group rings and their correlations to classical group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is centered around the classical problem of extracting properties of a finite group $G$ from the ring isomorphism class of its integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$. This problem is considered via describing the unit group $\mathcal{U}( \mathbb{Z} G)$ generically for a finite group. Since the $90's$ several well known generic constructions of units are known to generate a subgroup of finite index in $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z } G)$ if $\mathbb{Q} G$ does not have so-called exceptional simple epimorphic images, e.g. $M_2 (\mathbb{Q})$. However it remained a major open problem to find a {\it generic} construction under the presence of the latter type of simple images. In this article we obtain such generic construction of units. Moreover, this new construction also exhibits new properties, such as providing generically free subgroups of large rank. As an application we answer positively for several classes of groups recent conjectures on the rank and the periodic elements of the abelianisation $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z} G)^{ab}$. To obtain all this, we investigate the group ring $R \Gamma$ of an extension $\Gamma$ of some normal subgroup $N$ by a group $G$, over a domain $R$. More precisely, we obtain a direct sum decomposition of the (twisted) group algebra of $\Gamma$ over the fraction field $F$ of $R$ in terms of various twisted group rings of $G$ over finite extensions of $F$. Furthermore, concrete information on the kernel and cokernel of the associated projections is obtained. Along the way we also launch the investigations of the unit group of twisted group rings and of $\mathcal{U}( R\Gamma)$ via twisted group rings.</description>

      <title>The geometric constraints on Filippov algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filippov n-algebroids are introduced by Grabowski and Marmo as a natural generalization of Lie algebroids. On this note, we characterized Filippov n-algebroid structures by considering certain multi-input connections, which we called Filippov connections, on the underlying vector bundle. Through this approach, we could express the n-ary bracket of any Filippov n-algebroid using a torsion-free type formula. Additionally, we transformed the generalized Jacobi identity of the Filippov n-algebroid into the Bianchi-Filippov identity. Furthermore, in the case of rank n vector bundles, we provided a characterization of linear Nambu-Poisson structures using Filippov connections.</description>

      <title>DG singular equivalence and singular locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a commutative Gorenstein Noetherian ring $R$, we construct an affine scheme $X$ solely from DG singularity category $S_{dg}(R)$ of $R$ such that there is a finite surjective morphism $X \rightarrow \mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$, where $\mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$ is the singular locus in $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. As an application, for two such rings with equivalent DG singularity categories, we prove that the singular loci in their affine schemes have the same dimension.</description>
