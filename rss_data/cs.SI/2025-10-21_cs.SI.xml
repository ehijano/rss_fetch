      <title>Proactive and Fair Epidemic Resource Allocation Through an Integrated Supply Chain Framework: Insights from a COVID-19 Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely and effective decision-making is critical during epidemics to reduce preventable infections and deaths. This demands integrated models that jointly capture disease dynamics, vaccine distribution, regional disparities, and behavioral responses. However, most existing approaches decouple epidemic forecasting from logistics planning, hindering adaptive and regionally responsive interventions. We propose a novel epidemiological-optimization framework that jointly models epidemic progression and a multiscale vaccine supply chain. The model incorporates spatio-temporally varying effective infection rates to reflect regional policy and behavioral dynamics. It supports coordinated, data-driven decision-making across spatial scales through two formulations: a multi-objective Gini-based model and a knapsack-based model that leverages regional vulnerability indicators for tractability and improved mitigation. To address computational complexity, we design two scalable heuristic decomposition algorithms inspired by the Benders decomposition. The model is validated using COVID-19 data in the U.S.. We introduce SARIMA-based forecasting as a novel approach for validating epidemic-optimization models under data limitations. The results show that our approach can prevent more than 2 million infections and 30,000 deaths in just six months while significantly improving the accessibility of vaccines in underserved regions. Our framework demonstrates that integrating fairness and epidemic dynamics with vaccine logistics leads to superior outcomes compared to traditional myopic policies. Fairness improves overall efficiency in the long term by prioritizing the most vulnerable populations, leading to better long-term public health outcomes. The model offers policymakers a scalable and operationally relevant tool to strengthen preparedness and ensure a more effective and equitable response to epidemics.</description>

      <title>HyperSearch: Prediction of New Hyperedges through Unconstrained yet Efficient Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions (HOIs) in complex systems, such as scientific collaborations, multi-protein complexes, and multi-user communications, are commonly modeled as hypergraphs, where each hyperedge (i.e., a subset of nodes) represents an HOI among the nodes. Given a hypergraph, hyperedge prediction aims to identify hyperedges that are either missing or likely to form in the future, and it has broad applications, including recommending interest-based social groups, predicting collaborations, and uncovering functional complexes in biological systems. However, the vast search space of hyperedge candidates (i.e., all possible subsets of nodes) poses a significant computational challenge, making naive exhaustive search infeasible. As a result, existing approaches rely on either heuristic sampling to obtain constrained candidate sets or ungrounded assumptions on hypergraph structure to select promising hyperedges.
  In this work, we propose HyperSearch, a search-based algorithm for hyperedge prediction that efficiently evaluates unconstrained candidate sets, by incorporating two key components: (1) an empirically grounded scoring function derived from observations in real-world hypergraphs and (2) an efficient search mechanism, where we derive and use an anti-monotonic upper bound of the original scoring function (which is not antimonotonic) to prune the search space. This pruning comes with theoretical guarantees, ensuring that discarded candidates are never better than the kept ones w.r.t. the original scoring function. In extensive experiments on 10 real-world hypergraphs across five domains, HyperSearch consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy in predicting new (i.e., not in the training set) hyperedges.</description>

      <title>Opinion Maximization in Social Networks by Modifying Internal Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public opinion governance in social networks is critical for public health campaigns, political elections, and commercial marketing. In this paper, we addresse the problem of maximizing overall opinion in social networks by strategically modifying the internal opinions of key nodes. Traditional matrix inversion methods suffer from prohibitively high computational costs, prompting us to propose two efficient sampling-based algorithms. Furthermore, we develop a deterministic asynchronous algorithm that exactly identifies the optimal set of nodes through asynchronous update operations and progressive refinement, ensuring both efficiency and precision. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods outperform baseline approaches. Notably, our asynchronous algorithm delivers exceptional efficiency and accuracy across all scenarios, even in networks with tens of millions of nodes.</description>

      <title>The Neuroticism Paradox: How Emotional Instability Fuels Collective Feelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective emotions shape organizations, communities, and societies, yet the traits that determine who drives them remain unknown. Conventional wisdom holds that stable, extraverted individuals act as emotional leaders, calming and coordinating the feelings of others. Here we challenge this view by analyzing a 30.5-month longitudinal dataset of daily emotions from 38 co-located professionals (733,534 records). Using Granger-causality network reconstruction, we find that emotionally unstable individuals -- those high in neuroticism (r = 0.478, p = 0.002) and low in conscientiousness (r = -0.512, p = 0.001) -- are the true "emotional super-spreaders," while extraversion shows no effect (r = 0.238, p = 0.150). This "Neuroticism Paradox" reveals that emotional volatility, not stability, drives contagion. Emotions propagate with a reproduction rate (R_0 = 15.58) comparable to measles, yet the system avoids collapse through high clustering (C = 0.705) that creates "emotional quarantine zones." Emotional variance increased 22.9% over time, contradicting homeostasis theories and revealing entropy-driven dynamics. We propose an Affective Epidemiology framework showing that collective emotions are governed by network position and volatility rather than personality stability -- transforming how we understand emotional leadership in human systems.</description>

      <title>Network analysis reveals news press landscape and asymmetric user polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike traditional media, online news platforms allow users to consume content that suits their tastes and to facilitate interactions with other people. However, as more personalized consumption of information and interaction with like-minded users increase, ideological bias can inadvertently increase and contribute to the formation of echo chambers, reinforcing the polarization of opinions. Although the structural characteristics of polarization among different ideological groups in online spaces have been extensively studied, research into how these groups emotionally interact with each other has not been as thoroughly explored. From this perspective, we investigate both structural and affective polarization between news media user groups on Naver News, South Korea's largest online news portal, during the period of 2022 Korean presidential election. By utilizing the dataset comprising 333,014 articles and over 36 million user comments, we uncover two distinct groups of users characterized by opposing political leanings and reveal significant bias and polarization among them. Additionally, we reveal the existence of echo chambers within co-commenting networks and investigate the asymmetric affective interaction patterns between the two polarized groups. Classification task of news media articles based on the distinct comment response patterns support the notion that different political groups may employ distinct communication strategies. Our approach based on network analysis on large-scale comment dataset offers novel insights into characteristics of user polarization in the online news platforms and the nuanced interaction nature between user groups.</description>

      <title>Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</description>

      <title>Moving towards informative and actionable social media research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media is nearly ubiquitous in modern life, raising concerns about its societal impacts-from mental health and polarization to violence and democratic disruption. Yet research on its causal effects remains inconclusive: observational studies often find concerning associations, while randomized controlled trials (RCTs) tend to yield small, conflicting, or null results. Literature summaries tend to causally prioritize findings from RCTs, often arguing that concerns about social media are overstated. However, like observational studies, RCTs rely on assumptions that can easily be violated in the context of social media, especially regarding societal outcomes at scale. Here, we enumerate and examine the features of social media as a complex system that challenge our ability to infer causality at societal scales. Drawing on insight from disciplines that have faced similar challenges, like climate-science or epidemiology, we propose a path forward that combines the strength of observational and experimental approaches while acknowledging the limitations of each.</description>

      <title>Collective Intelligence Outperforms Individual Talent: A Case Study in League of Legends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaming environments are popular testbeds for studying human interactions and behaviors in complex artificial intelligence systems. Particularly, in multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, individuals collaborate in virtual environments of high realism that involves real-time strategic decision-making and trade-offs on resource management, information collection and sharing, team synergy and collective dynamics. This paper explores whether collective intelligence, emerging from cooperative behaviours exhibited by a group of individuals, who are not necessarily skillful but effectively engage in collaborative problem-solving tasks, exceeds individual intelligence observed within skillful individuals. This is shown via a case study in League of Legends, using machine learning algorithms and statistical methods applied to large-scale data collected for the same purpose. By modelling systematically game-specific metrics but also new game-agnostic topological and graph spectra measures of cooperative interactions, we demonstrate compelling insights about the superior performance of collective intelligence.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of A National Digitally-Enabled Health Promotion Campaign for Mental Health Awareness using Social Media Platforms Tik Tok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental health disorders rank among the 10 leading contributors to the global burden of diseases, yet persistent stigma and care barriers delay early intervention. This has inspired efforts to leverage digital platforms for scalable health promotion to engage at-risk populations. To evaluate the effectiveness of a digitally-enabled mental health promotion (DEHP) campaign, we conducted an observational cross-sectional study of a 3-month (February-April 2025) nation-wide campaign in Singapore. Campaign materials were developed using a marketing funnel framework and disseminated across YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. This included narrative videos and infographics to promote symptom awareness, coping strategies, and/or patient navigation to Singapore's Mindline website, as the intended endpoint for user engagement and support. Primary outcomes include anonymised performance analytics (impressions, unique reach, video content view, engagements) stratified by demographics, device types, and sector. Secondary outcomes measured cost-efficiency metrics and traffic to the Mindline website respectively. This campaign generated 3.49 million total impressions and reached 1.39 million unique residents, with a Cost Per Click at 29.33 SGD, Cost Per Mille at 26.90 SGD and Cost Per Action at 6.06 SGD. Narrative videos accumulated over 630,000 views and 18,768 engagements. Overall, we demonstrate that DEHP campaigns can achieve national engagement for mental health awareness through multi-channel distribution and creative, narrative-driven designs.</description>

Abstract: Innovation ecosystems require careful policy stewardship to drive sustained advance in human health, welfare, security and prosperity. We develop new measures that reliably decompose the influence of innovations in terms of the degree to which each represents a field-level foundation, an extension of foundational work, or a generalization that synthesizes and modularizes contributions from distant fields to catalyze combinatorial innovation. Using 23 million scientific works from OpenAlex and 19 million works from Web of Science, we demonstrate that while foundational and extensional work within fields has declined in recent years-a trend garnering much recent attention-generalizations across fields have increased and accelerated with the rise of the web, social media, and artificial intelligence, shifting the locus of innovation from within fields to across the system as a whole. We explore implications for science policy.</description>

      <title>Domain-based user embedding for competing events on social media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social divide and polarization have become significant societal issues. To understand the mechanisms behind these phenomena, social media analysis offers research opportunities in computational social science, where developing effective user embedding methods is essential for subsequent analysis. Traditionally, researchers have used predefined network-based user features (e.g., network size, degree, and centrality measures). However, because such measures may not capture the complex characteristics of social media users, in our study we developed a method for embedding users based on a URL domain co-occurrence network. This approach effectively represents social media users involved in competing events such as political campaigns and public health crises. We assessed the method's performance using binary classification tasks and datasets that covered topics associated with the COVID-19 infodemic, such as QAnon, Biden, and Ivermectin, among Twitter users. Our results revealed that user embeddings generated directly from the retweet network and/or based on language performed below expectations, whereas our domain-based embeddings outperformed those methods while reducing computation time. Therefore, domain-based embedding offers an accessible and effective method for characterizing social media users in competing events.</description>

      <title>Evolving interdisciplinary contributions to global societal challenges: A 50-year overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing global societal challenges necessitates insights and expertise that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. In recent decades, interdisciplinary collaboration has been recognised as a vital driver of innovation and effective problem-solving, with the potential to profoundly influence policy and practice worldwide. However, quantitative evidence remains limited regarding how cross-disciplinary efforts contribute to societal challenges, as well as the evolving roles and relevance of specific disciplines in addressing these issues. To fill this gap, this study examines the long-term evolution of interdisciplinary contributions to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), drawing on extensive bibliometric data from OpenAlex. By analysing publication and citation trends across 19 research fields from 1970 to 2022, we reveal how the relative presence of different disciplines in addressing particular SDGs has shifted over time. Our results also provide unique evidence of the increasing interconnection between fields since the 2000s, coinciding with the United Nations' initiative to tackle global societal challenges through interdisciplinary efforts. These insights will benefit policymakers and practitioners as they reflect on past progress and plan for future action, particularly with the SDG target deadline approaching in the next five years.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Graph Anomaly Detection via Test-Time Training with Homophily-Guided Self-Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) has demonstrated great effectiveness in identifying unusual patterns within graph-structured data. However, while labeled anomalies are often scarce in emerging applications, existing supervised GAD approaches are either ineffective or not applicable when moved across graph domains due to distribution shifts and heterogeneous feature spaces. To address these challenges, we present GADT3, a novel test-time training framework for cross-domain GAD. GADT3 combines supervised and self-supervised learning during training while adapting to a new domain during test time using only self-supervised learning by leveraging a homophily-based affinity score that captures domain-invariant properties of anomalies. Our framework introduces four key innovations to cross-domain GAD: an effective self-supervision scheme, an attention-based mechanism that dynamically learns edge importance weights during message passing, domain-specific encoders for handling heterogeneous features, and class-aware regularization to address imbalance. Experiments across multiple cross-domain settings demonstrate that GADT3 significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving average improvements of over 8.2\% in AUROC and AUPRC compared to the best competing model.</description>

      <title>LLMTaxo: Leveraging Large Language Models for Constructing Taxonomy of Factual Claims from Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12325</link>

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of content on social media platforms, analyzing and comprehending online discourse has become increasingly complex. This paper introduces LLMTaxo, a novel framework leveraging large language models for the automated construction of taxonomies of factual claims from social media by generating topics at multiple levels of granularity. The resulting hierarchical structure significantly reduces redundancy and improves information accessibility. We also propose dedicated taxonomy evaluation metrics to enable comprehensive assessment. Evaluations conducted on three diverse datasets demonstrate LLMTaxo's effectiveness in producing clear, coherent, and comprehensive taxonomies. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4o mini consistently outperforms others across most metrics. The framework's flexibility and low reliance on manual intervention underscore its potential for broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Mapping the interaction between science and misinformation in COVID-19 tweets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, scientific knowledge evolved rapidly, accompanied by a surge of misinformation, labelled an infodemic by the WHO. In this context, we study the interaction between science and misinformation on Twitter (now X) using a database of ~407M COVID-19-related tweets. We classify URL reliability with Media Bias/Fact Check and used Altmetric data to identify scientific publications. We find that among ~1.2M users who shared science, 45% also shared unreliable content. Scientific papers circulated by these users were more often preprints, slightly more likely to be retracted, less cited, and published in lower-impact journals. Our findings indicate misinformation is not driven by a lack of exposure to science but instead raise critical questions about open science practices, particularly the role of preprints in amplifying misleading narratives. Our results underscore the importance of proactive scientific engagement on social media in countering misinformation and reinforcing trust in science during global crises.</description>
