      <title>The Geometry of Three-Forms on Symplectic Six-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometry associated with 3-forms of various orbital type on a symplectic 6-manifold. We show that there are extremely rich geometric structures attached to certain unstable 3-forms arising naturally from degeneration of Calabi-Yau structures, which in turn provides us a new perspective towards the SYZ conjecture. We give concrete examples and demonstrate that the limiting behavior of the Type IIA flow can be used to detect canonical geometric structures on symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Information Geometric Framework For Point Cloud Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for comparing 3D point clouds, a critical task in various machine learning applications. By interpreting point clouds as samples from underlying probability density functions, the statistical manifold structure is given to the space of point clouds. This manifold structure will help us to use the information geometric tools to analyze the point clouds. Our method uses the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to find the probability density functions and the Modified Symmetric KL divergence to measure how similar the corresponding probability density functions are. This method of comparing the point clouds takes care of the geometry of the objects represented by the point clouds. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we take up five distinct case studies:(i) comparison of basic geometric shapes, (ii) comparison of 3D human body shapes within the MP FAUST dataset, (iii) comparison of animal shapes, (iv) comparison of human and animal datasets and (v) comparison of audio signals.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent structures of oriented neutral vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nilpotent structures of an oriented vector bundle $E$ of rank $4n$ with a neutral metric $h$ and an $h$-connection $\nabla$. We define $H$-nilpotent structures of $(E, h, \nabla )$ for a Lie subgroup $H$ of $SO(2n, 2n)$ related to neutral hyperK\"{a}hler structures. We observe that there exist a complex structure $I$ and paracomplex structures $J_1$, $J_2$ of $E$ such that $h$, $\nabla$, $I$, $J_1$, $J_2$ form a neutral hyperK\"{a}hler structure of $E$ if and only if there exists an $H$-nilpotent structure of $(E, h, \nabla )$.</description>

      <title>The local cohomology of vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the local cohomology of vector fields on a manifold. In the smooth case this recovers the diagonal cohomology studied in work of Losik, Guillemin, Fuks and others. In the holomorphic case this cohomology has recently appeared in work of Hennion and Kapranov in their study of the Lie algebra cohomology of vector fields on a complex manifold. Additionally, we construct explicit representatives for cocycles in Gelfand--Fuks cohomology via descent.</description>

      <title>Uniform degeneration of hyperbolic surfaces with boundary along harmonic map rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unique harmonic maps between surfaces give a parametrization of the Teichm\"{u}ller space by holomorphic quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface. In this paper, we investigate the degeneration of hyperbolic surfaces corresponding to a ray of meromorphic quadratic differentials on a punctured Riemann surface in this parametrization, where the meromorphic quadratic differentials have a pole of order $\geq 2$ at each puncture. We show that the rescaled distance functions of the universal covers of hyperbolic surfaces uniformly converge, on a certain non-compact region containing a fundamental domain, to the intersection number with the vertical measured foliation given by the meromorphic quadratic differential determining the direction of the ray. This implies the family of hyperbolic surfaces converges to the dual $\mathbb{R}$-tree to the vertical measured foliation in the sense of Gromov-Hausdorff. As an application, we describe the limit in the function space on the set of isotopy classes of properly embedded arcs and simple closed curves on the surface.</description>

      <title>Kiselman Minimum Principle and Rooftop Envelopes in Complex Hessian Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of $m$-subharmonic functions with respect to a semipositive $(1,1)$-form in Euclidean domains, providing a significant element in understanding geodesics within the context of complex Hessian equations. Based on the foundational Perron envelope construction, we prove a decomposition of $m$-subharmonic solutions, and a general comparison principle that effectively manages singular Hessian measures. Additionally, we establish a rooftop equality and an analogue of the Kiselman minimum principle, which are crucial ingredients in establishing a criterion for geodesic connectivity among $m$-subharmonic functions, expressed in terms of their asymptotic envelopes.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Blaschke locus has the structure of a finite dimensional smooth manifold away from the Teichm{\"u}ller space and study its Riemannian manifold structure with respect to the covariance metric introduced by Guillarmou, Knieper and Lefeuvre in \cite{GeodesicStretch}. We also identify some families of geodesics in the Blaschke locus arising from Hitchin representations for orbifolds and show that they have infinite length with respect to the covariance metric.</description>

      <title>Special Joyce structures and hyperk\"ahler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joyce structures were introduced by T. Bridgeland in the context of the space of stability conditions of a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau category and its associated Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In subsequent work, T. Bridgeland and I. Strachan showed that Joyce structures satisfying a certain non-degeneracy condition encode a complex hyperk\"{a}hler structure on the tangent bundle of the base of the Joyce structure. In this work we give a definition of an analogous structure over an affine special K\"{a}hler (ASK) manifold, which we call a special Joyce structure. Furthermore, we show that it encodes a real hyperk\"{a}hler (HK) structure on the tangent bundle of the ASK manifold, possibly of indefinite signature. Particular examples include the semi-flat HK metric associated to an ASK manifold (also known as the rigid c-map metric) and the HK metrics associated to certain uncoupled variations of BPS structures over the ASK manifold. Finally, we relate the HK metrics coming from special Joyce structures to HK metrics on the total space of algebraic integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite-area non-compact hyperbolic surface. We study the spectrum of the Laplacian on random covering surfaces of X and on random unitary bundles over X. We show that there is a constant $c &gt; 0$ such that, with probability tending to 1 as $n \to \infty$, a uniformly random degree-$n$ Riemannian covering surface $X_n$ of $X$ has no Laplacian eigenvalues below $\frac{1}{4}-c\frac{(\log\log\log n)^2}{\log \log n}$ other than those of $X$ and with the same multiplicities. We also show that with probability tending to 1 as $n\to \infty$, a random unitary bundle $E_{\phi}$ over $X$ of rank $n$ has no Laplacian eigenvalues below $\frac{1}{4}-c\frac{(\log\log n)^2}{\log n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we generalize the notion of entropy for potentials in a relative full Monge-Amp\`ere mass $\mathcal{E}(X, \theta, \phi)$, for a model potential $\phi$. We then investigate stability properties of this condition with respect to blow-ups and perturbation of the cohomology class. We also prove a Moser-Trudinger type inequality with general weight and we show that functions with finite entropy lie in a relative energy class $\mathcal{E}^{\frac{n}{n-1}}(X, \theta, \phi)$ (provided $n&gt;1$), while they have the same singularities of $\phi$ when $n=1$.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it has become widely appreciated that (higher) gauge theories need, besides their variational phase space data, to be equipped with "flux quantization laws" in generalized differential cohomology, there used to be no general prescription for how to define and construct the resulting flux-quantized phase space stacks.
  In this short note we observe that all higher Maxwell-type equations have solution spaces given by flux densities on a Cauchy surface subject to a higher Gauss law and no further constraint: The metric duality-constraint is all absorbed into the evolution equation away from the Cauchy surface.
  Moreover, we observe that the higher Gauss law characterizes the Cauchy data as flat differential forms valued in a characteristic L-infinity-algebra. Using the recent construction of the non-abelian Chern-Dold character map, this implies that compatible flux quantization laws on phase space have classifying spaces whose rational Whitehead L-infinity algebra is this characteristic one. The flux-quantized higher phase space stack of the theory is then simply the corresponding (generally non-abelian) differential cohomology moduli stack on the Cauchy surface.
  We show how this systematic prescription subsumes existing proposals for flux-quantized phase spaces of vacuum Maxwell theory and of the chiral boson. Moreover, for the case of NS/RR-fields in type II supergravity, the traditional "Hypothesis K" of flux quantization in topological K-theory is naturally implied, without the need, on phase space, for the notorious further duality constraint. Finally, as a genuinely non-abelian example, we consider flux-quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity/M-theory given by unstable differential 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H") and emphasize again that, implemented on Cauchy data, this qualifies as the full phase space without the need for a further duality constraint.</description>
