      <title>Ultrafast probing of isotope-induced explciit symmetry breaking in ethylene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry governs nature's law, yet many of the natural phenomena occur due to the breakdown of symmetry. Here, we show how isotope-induced inversion symmetry breaking influences ultrafast photoisomerization processes in ethylene. Using extreme ultraviolet pump-near infrared probe time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we find that replacing one of the carbon atoms in ethylene with a 13C isotope leads to twice-faster structural relaxation via ethylene-ethylidene isomerization in the photo-excited molecular cation. Advanced trajectory surface hopping calculations incorporating the nuclear symmetry of the molecular systems, reveal that it arises from the mixing of different normal modes in the isotope-substituted species, interactions otherwise forbidden by symmetry. Although the mixing does not alter the symmetry of the electronic Hamiltonian, it modifies that of the nuclear Hamiltonian, causing explicit symmetry breaking. This facilitates efficient intra-molecular vibrational energy redistribution, lowering the isomerization yield. Our findings offer opportunities to use isotope-induced nuclear symmetry breaking to control the outcome of light-molecule interactions across ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Automated selection of nuclear coordinates for reduced dimensionality nonadiabatic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poor scaling of dynamics simulations with number of dimensions is currently a major limiting factor in the simulation of photochemical processes. In this work, we investigate ways to reduce the dimensionality of many-atom systems with a view toward enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Using mixed quantum-classical Trajectory Surface Hopping (TSH) simulations of three photoreactive molecules - trans-azomethane (tAZM), butyrolactone (Bulac), and furanone (Fur) - we explore two different dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Normal Mode Variance (NMV). Dynamics simulations are run in full dimensionality and reduced dimensionality, employing either PCA or NMV, and the impact of the dimensionality reduction on selected electronic and geometric properties of the dynamics is evaluated. For all three molecules, both PCA and NMV can be used to select lower-dimensional spaces in which the full-dimensionality dynamics results are reproduced. PCA reduction outperforms NMV in all systems, allowing for a more significant dimensionality reduction without loss of accuracy. The improved accuracy of PCA is, for tAZM, mostly seen in the electronic properties while for both Fur and Bulac the advantage is clear in the ring-opening reaction itself as well. The present approach opens routes to simulation of larger photochemically relevant systems, through the use of automated dimensionality reduction, avoiding human bias.</description>

      <title>Attochemical control of nuclear motion despite fast electronic decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-in-time, broad-in-energy attosecond or few-femtosecond pulses can excite coherent superpositions of several electronic states in molecules. This results in ultrafast charge oscillations known as charge migration. A key open question in the emerging field of attochemistry is whether these electron dynamics, which due to decoherence often last only for a few femtoseconds, can influence longer-time scale nuclear rearrangements. Herein, we address this question through full-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations of the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics initiated by ionization and coherent excitation of ethylene. The simulations of this prototype organic chromophore predict electronic coherences with half-lives of less than 1 fs. Despite their brevity, these electronic coherences induce vibrational coherences along the derivative coupling vectors that persist for at least 50 fs. These results suggest that short-lived electronic coherences can impart long-lasting legacies on nuclear motion, a finding of potential importance to the interpretation of attosecond experiments and the development of strategies for attochemical control.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Reaction on Pt-Based Electrocatalysts through Surface Decoration for Improved OH Reduction Equilibrium and Reduced H2O Adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical energy and substance conversion devices involve complex electrode processes, characterized by multiple charge transfer steps, competing pathways, and various intermediates. Such complexity makes it challenging to enhance electrocatalytic activity. The prevailing strategy typically focuses on optimizing the geometric and electronic structures of the electrocatalysts to align the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates with the peak of the activity Volcano curve. In this study, we demonstrate that surface decoration can effectively shape the micro reaction environment for the model system of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt electrodes. By applying a partial hydrophobic I* adlayer on the Pt surface, we can shift the equilibrium of OH* reduction and weaken H2O* adsorption, which significantly enhances ORR kinetics. With in situ scan tunneling microscopy (STM) and theoretical calculations, our study reveals the formation of isolated Pt2 surface units situated in a hydrophobic valley surrounded by adsorbed iodine atoms. This minimalist Pt2 active unit exhibits significantly greater activity for ORR compared to an extended Pt surface. This strategy could pave the way for developing highly efficient catalysts with potential applications in fuel cell technology and metal air batteries and extension to other electrochemical conversion reactions such as ammonia synthesis and CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>Isotopic Fingerprints of Proton-mediated Dielectric Relaxation in Solid and Liquid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report cross-validated measurements of the isotope effect on dielectric relaxation for four isotopologues of ice and water, including the 1-10^5 Hz region, in which only sporadic and inconsistent measurements were previously available. In ice, the relaxation rates exhibit an activated temperature dependence with an isotope-independent activation energy. Across 248-273 K, the H_2O/D_2O relaxation rate ratio remains constant at 2.0 \pm 0.1. This scaling agrees with Kramers' theory in the high-friction limit if the moving mass is the proton or deuteron, indicating that dielectric relaxation is governed by a classic proton transfer over an energy barrier rather than molecular reorientation.</description>

      <title>Diffraction-Unlimited Tip-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Vibrational Nanoscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sum-frequency generation (SFG) is a powerful second-order nonlinear spectroscopic technique that provides detailed insights into molecular structures and absolute orientations at surfaces and interfaces. However, conventional SFG based on far-field schemes suffers from the diffraction limit of light, which inherently averages spectroscopic information over micrometer-scale regions and obscures nanoscale structural inhomogeneity. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by leveraging a highly confined optical near field within a tip-substrate nanogap of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), pushing the spatial resolution of SFG down to ~10 nm, a nearly two-orders-of-magnitude improvement over conventional far-field SFG. By capturing tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) spectra concurrently with STM scanning, we demonstrate the capability to resolve nanoscale variation in molecular adsorption structures across distinct interfacial domains. To rigorously interpret the observed TE-SFG spectra, we newly developed a comprehensive theoretical framework for the TE-SFG process and confirm via numerical simulations that the TE-SFG response under our current experimental conditions is dominantly governed by the dipole-field interactions, with negligible contributions from higher-order multipole effects. The dominance of the dipole mechanism ensures that the observed TE-SFG spectra faithfully reflect not only nanoscale interfacial structural features but also absolute up/down molecular orientations. This study presents the first experimental realization of diffraction-unlimited second-order nonlinear vibrational SFG nanoscopy, opening a new avenue for nanoscale domain-specific investigation of molecular structures and dynamics within inhomogeneous interfacial molecular systems beyond the conventional far-field SFG and STM imaging.</description>

      <title>Bath-induced stabilization of classical non-linear response in two dimensional infrared spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical response functions have shown considerable promise in computational 2D IR modeling; however, a simple diagrammatic description, analogous to that for open quantum systems, has been lacking. While a promising diagrammatic approach has recently been introduced for isolated systems, the resulting nonlinear response functions remain unstable at long times, a characteristic feature of integrable classical systems. Here, we extend this framework to incorporate system-bath interactions under the weak-anharmonicity approximation and explore the resulting conditions for bath-induced stabilization. The resulting expression for the weakly anharmonic response function is remarkably simple and exhibits a one-to-one correspondence with the quantum counterpart in the $\hbar\to 0$ limit, offering potential computational advantages in extending the approach to large, multi-oscillator systems. We find that (to lowest order in anharmonicity) the bath-induced stabilization of both linear and nonlinear classical response functions depends sensitively on the nature of spectral density, particularly on the balance between low-frequency and high-frequency components. Application of this classical diagrammatic approach to 2D IR spectroscopy of the amide I band captures the characteristic population-time-dependent dynamics associated with spectral diffusion, suggesting that the approach may prove useful in describing real experimental systems at ambient temperatures.</description>

      <title>Core-Excited States of Linear and Bent Uranyl Complexes: Insights from High-Energy Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy and Relativistic Quantum Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced X-ray spectroscopic techniques are widely recognized as state-of-the-art tools for probing the electronic structure, bonding, and chemical environments of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. In this study, we employ X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements in high-energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD-XANES) mode to investigate the core states arising from excitations out of the U 3d${_{3/2}}$ (M$_4$ edge) levels for molecular complexes in which the uranyl moiety deviates from linearity to varying degrees, and in particular systems containing the UO$_2$Cl$_2$ group such as UO$_2$Cl$_2$.n(H$_2$O) and UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$, which in the latter case exhibits a pronounced O-U-O bending angle. These U M$_4$ edge HERFD-XANES spectra are compared to those of other uranyl complexes reported in the literature. This evaluation is complemented by \textit{ab initio} relativistic quantum chemistry simulations on the [UO$_2$(NO$_3$)$_2$.n(H$_2$O)], UO$_2$Cl$_2$.n(H$_2$O) and UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$ systems, using 2-component Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) with the CAM-B3LYP functional, employing the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (2c-TDA). Our 2c-TDA simulations show modest deviations from the HERFD-XANES data, with peak splittings differing by less than 1 eV from experimental values. These core-excited states were further characterized by Natural Transition Orbital (NTO) analysis. Overall, our results highlight the influence of equatorial ligands on the spectroscopic signatures, particularly pronounced in UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$, where the U 3d$_{3/2}$ $\rightarrow$ 5f$\sigma_u^*$ satellite transition appears at lower energies compared to the other systems studied.</description>

      <title>Excited State Densities from Time-Dependent Density Functional Response Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the variational principle for excited-state energies leads to a route to obtaining excited-state densities from time-dependent density functional theory, relatively little attention has been paid to the quality of the resulting densities in real space obtained with different exchange-correlation functional approximations, nor how non-adiabatic approximations developed for energies of states of double excitation character perform for their densities. Here we derive an expression directly in real space for the excited-state density, that includes the case of non-adiabatic kernels, and consequently is able, for the first time, to yield densities of states of double-excitation character. Under some well-defined simplifications, we compare the performance of the local-density approximation and exact-exchange approximation, which are in a sense at opposite extremes of the fundamental functional approximations, on local and charge-transfer excitations in one-dimensional model systems, and show that the dressed TDDFT approach gives good densities of double-excitations.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Driven Magnetization Emerges from Relativistic Four-Current Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a striking quantum phenomenon in which electron transport through chiral molecules leads to spin polarization -- even in the absence of external magnetic fields or magnetic components. Although observed in systems such as DNA, helicenes, proteins, and polymers, the fundamental physical origin of CISS remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a time-dependent relativistic four-current framework, in which charge and current densities evolve according to the time-dependent variational principle. Real-time relativistic four-current simulations enable direct analysis of helical currents and induced magnetization dynamics. Applied to helicenes -- axially chiral molecules lacking stereocenters -- our simulations reveal curvature-induced helical electron currents that generate spontaneous magnetic fields aligned along the molecular axis. These fields are handedness-dependent and reach magnitudes of $10^{-1}$ Tesla per single helicene strand. Our results suggest that CISS may arise from intrinsic, relativistic curvature-induced helical currents and the associated magnetic fields within chiral molecules. This four-current mechanism offers a self-contained explanation for the driving force underlying spin selectivity, independent of interfacial effects or unphysically enhanced spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, our results provide a new perspective that offers a unifying framework with the potential to reconcile many existing hypotheses and theoretical models, while also suggesting several testable predictions that can be examined experimentally.</description>

Abstract: Graphs are used to represent and analyze data in domains as diverse as physics, biology, chemistry, planetary science, and the social sciences. Across domains, random graph models relate generative processes to expected graph properties, and allow for sampling from distinct ensembles. Here we introduce a new random graph model, inspired by assembly theory, and characterize the graphs it generates. We show that graphs generated using our method represent a diverse ensemble, characterized by a broad range of summary statistics, unexpected even in graphs with identical degree sequences. Finally we demonstrate that the distinct properties of these graphs are enabled by historical contingencies during the generative process. These results lay the foundation for further development of novel sampling methods based on assembly theory with applications to drug discovery and materials science.</description>

      <title>Designing Antiferromagnetic Spin-1/2 Chains in Janus Fullerene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the linear arrangement of spin-1/2 C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the exploration of many-body quantum phases.</description>
