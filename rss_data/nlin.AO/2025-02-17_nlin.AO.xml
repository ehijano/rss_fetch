      <title>Interpretable Early Warnings using Machine Learning in an Online Game-experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stemming from physics and later applied to other fields such as ecology, the theory of critical transitions suggests that some regime shifts are preceded by statistical early warning signals. Reddit's r/place experiment, a large-scale social game, provides a unique opportunity to test these signals consistently across thousands of subsystems undergoing critical transitions. In r/place, millions of users collaboratively created compositions, or pixel-art drawings, in which transitions occur when one composition rapidly replaces another. We develop a machine-learning-based early warning system that combines the predictive power of multiple system-specific time series via gradient-boosted decision trees with memory-retaining features. Our method significantly outperforms standard early warning indicators. Trained on the 2022 r/place data, our algorithm detects half of the transitions occurring within 20 minutes at a false positive rate of just 3.7%. Its performance remains robust when tested on the 2023 r/place event, demonstrating generalizability across different contexts. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting the predictions, we investigate the underlying drivers of warnings, which could be relevant to other complex systems, especially online social systems. We reveal an interplay of patterns preceding transitions, such as critical slowing down or speeding up, a lack of innovation or coordination, turbulent histories, and a lack of image complexity. These findings show the potential of machine learning indicators in socio-ecological systems for predicting regime shifts and understanding their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Coevolutionary game dynamics with localized environmental resource feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic environments shape diverse dynamics in evolutionary game systems. We introduce spatial heterogeneity of resources into the prisoner's dilemma game model to explore coevolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback. The availability of resources significantly affects the survival competitiveness of surrounding individuals. Feedback between individuals' strategies and the resources they can use leads to the oscillating dynamic known as the "oscillatory tragedy of the commons". Our findings indicate that when the influence of individuals' strategies on the update rate of resources is significantly high in systems characterized by environmental heterogeneity, they can attain an equilibrium state that avoids the oscillatory tragedy. In contrast to the numerical results obtained in well-mixed structures, self-organized clustered patterns emerge in simulations utilizing square lattices, further enhancing the stability of the system. We discuss critical phenomena in detail, demonstrating that the aforementioned transition is robust across various system parameters, including the strength of cooperators in restoring the environment, initial distributions of cooperators, system size and structures, and noise.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</description>
