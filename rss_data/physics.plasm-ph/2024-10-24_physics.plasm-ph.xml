      <title>Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters for Deep Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the development of Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters (AF-MPDTs) present themselves to be an increasingly promising propulsion technology for deep space exploration missions. Various entities, ranging from state-sponsored institutions to privately-owned startups, have developed AF-MPDTs across a wide range of power levels. Current developments in superconducting technologies, namely High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) coils such as REBCO, have enabled research into the integration of HTS coils into the applied-field module to generate MPD thrust. Developments in space cryocoolers have opened the doors for HTS use within a spaceflight design of an AF-MPDT, where the applied-field module is at 40 K. A TRL of 4-5 has been reached by some AF-MPDT prototypes; venturing beyond this will require higher cooling power space cryocoolers to be developed in parallel and appropriately integrated into the thruster. Moreover, bespoke thermal control is required to maintain the thruster's extreme temperature gradient where the cryocooled HTS are in close proximity to the thruster cathode. More effective space power supply units with higher power generation is a further limitation to reaching TRL 9. This review examines the underlying principles behind AF-MPDT propulsion and the recent global developments in AF-MPDT technology, with an in-depth analysis and critical discussion on the spaceflight components necessary to permit AF-MPDTs to become a widely-adopted spaceflight-ready propulsion technology.</description>

      <title>A generalized Frenet frame for computing MHD equilibria in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the representation of axi-symmetric plasma configurations (tokamaks), it is natural to use cylindrical coordinates $(R,Z,\phi)$, where $\phi$ is an independent coordinate. The same cylindrical coordinates have also been widely used for representing 3D MHD equilibria of non-axisymmetric configurations (stellarators), with cross-sections, defined in $(R,Z)$-planes, that vary over $\phi$.
  Stellarator equilibria have been found, however, for which cylindrical coordinates are not at all a natural choice, for instance certain stellarators obtained using the near-axis expansion (NAE), defined by a magnetic axis curve and its Frenet frame.
  In this contribution we demonstrate how to use an \emph{axis-following frame} that we call a 'generalized Frenet frame', as an alternative to using cylindrical coordinates in a 3D MHD equilibrium solver. We see two advantages: 1) the capability to easily represent configurations where the magnetic axis is highly non-planar or even knotted. 2) a reduction in the degrees of freedom needed for the geometry, enabling progress in optimization of these configurations.
  We discuss the definition of the generalized Frenet frame, and details of the implementation of the new frame in the 3D MHD equilibrium solver GVEC. Furthermore, we demonstrate for a highly shaped QI-optimized stellarator that far fewer degrees of freedom are necessary to find a high quality equilibrium solution, compared to the solution computed in cylindrical coordinates.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of neoclassical transport in nearly quasi-isodynamic stellarator magnetic fields using MONKES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellarator magnetic fields that are perfectly optimized for neoclassical transport (with levels of radial neoclassical transport comparable to tokamaks) are called omnigenous. Quasi-isodynamic magnetic fields are a subset of omnigenous magnetic fields in which the isolines of the magnetic field strength close poloidally, which grants them the additional property of producing zero bootstrap current. A frequent strategy in the quest for quasi-isodynamic configurations is to optimize the magnetic field indirectly by minimizing proxies that vanish in an exactly quasi-isodynamic field. The recently developed code MONKES enables fast computations of the neoclassical radial transport and bootstrap current monoenergetic coefficients, and therefore facilitates enormously to assess the efficiency of such indirect approach. By evaluating the large database of intermediate configurations that led to the configuration CIEMAT-QI, the inefficiency of the indirect optimization strategy for minimizing the bootstrap current is illustrated. In addition, MONKES is used to take the first steps in the exploration of a region of the configuration space of piecewise omnigenous fields, a novel family of optimized magnetic fields that has broadened the configuration space of stellarators with low levels of radial neoclassical transport.</description>

      <title>On the linearity and stability of electrostatic structures based on the Schamel equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contributes in the first part to the correct understanding of the linear limit in the Schamel equation (S-equation) from the perspective of structure formation in collisionless plasmas. The corresponding modes near equilibrium turn out to be nonlinear modes of the underlying microscopic Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system for which particle trapping is responsible. A simple shift of the electrostatic potential to a new pedestal leads to non-negativity and thus mitigates the positivity problem of the S-equation. The stability of a solitary electron hole (bright soliton), based on both the S-equation and an earlier transverse but limited VP instability analysis, exhibits marginal stability and linear perturbations in the form of the asymmetric shift eigenmode of a solvable Schr\"odinger problem. This finding of a dominant shift mode perturbation also seems to have been observed in a numerical PIC simulation, thus providing some confirmation for both theories.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Fusion Ignition Principles: Zeroth Order Factors of Fusion Energy Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical goal of fusion energy research is to confine fusion fuel in a certain way so that the energy released from fusion exceeds the energy consumed to sustain the fusion process, thereby achieving economically viable energy production. Based on fundamental physics, this book focuses on the physics of the core region in fusion energy reactors, discussing the relevant limiting factors and parameter ranges. By examining the zeroth-order quantity system of the fundamental principles of fusion ignition, we review the current progress and challenges in fusion energy research. These challenges encompass various aspects such as physics, engineering, materials, and economics, providing better insights for the future development of fusion as an energy source.

      <title>External charge perturbation in a flowing plasma and electrostatic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, an 1D electrostatic hybrid-Particle-in-Cell-Monte-Carlo-Collision (h-PIC-MCC) code [1, 2] is used to study the response of a plasma to a moving, external, charged perturbation (debris). We show that the so-called pinned solitons can form only under certain specific conditions through a turbulent regime of the ion-ion counter-streaming electrostatic instability (IICSI). In fact, the pinned solitons are manifestation of the ion phase-space vortices formed around the debris. The simulation shows that the pinned solitons can form only when the debris velocity exceeds a certain critical velocity pushing the instability to a turbulent regime and can then disappear when debris velocity becomes highly supersonic. We further show the existence of a Kolmogorov-type energy cascade scaling [3] for this electrostatic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Plasma stratification in AC discharges in noble gases at low currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05926v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid kinetic-fluid model is used to study plasma stratification in alternating current (AC) discharges in noble gases at low plasma densities. Self-consistent coupled solutions of a nonlocal kinetic equation for electrons, a drift-diffusion equation of ions, and a Poisson equation for the electric field are obtained for a positive column and the entire discharge with near-electrode sheaths. A simplified two-level excitation-ionization model neglects the nonlinear effects due to stepwise ionization, gas heating, and Coulomb interactions among electrons. Standing striations are obtained for the reduced values of electric fields, E/p, corresponding to the inelastic energy balance of electrons in a range of driving frequencies. An analog of Novak law (striation length proportional to the excitation threshold of atoms and inversely proportional to the mean square root of the electric field), is observed in simulations, indicating the nonlocal nature of standing striations in AC discharges at low plasma densities. Stratified plasma operates in a dynamic regime for various driving frequencies. In this regime, ions respond to the time-averaged electric field, whereas electrons react to the instantaneous electric field. The disparity of time scales between ambipolar diffusion, which occurs at the ion time scale, and electron kinetics in the coordinate-energy phase space, which occurs at the free electron diffusion time scale, produces complicated fluxes in the phase space (due to electron heating, energy loss in collisions, and ionization processes) that are responsible for the stratification. Our paper emphasizes the need for the kinetic approach to analyze stratification phenomena in AC discharge of noble gases. It promotes an efficient method for the kinetic treatment of electrons that is an alternative to the commonly used PIC method.</description>

      <title>Evaluating ion dynamics through Coulomb and Yukawa interaction potentials in one component strongly coupled plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric pressure helium plasmas are investigated through molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature (300 K) for various ionization fractions ($\chi_i = 10^{-1} - 10^{-5}$) in the strongly coupled regime (ion coupling parameter, $\Gamma_i \sim 1 - 10$) employing Coulomb and Yukawa interaction potentials. The role of electron screening in ion dynamics and energetics is examined through ion and gas temperatures, mean squared displacement of ions, ion coupling parameter, and radial distribution function of the system. It is found that electron screening in the Yukawa potential significantly limits the disorder-induced heating (DIH) mechanism for strongly ionized plasmas ($\chi_i$ $\ge 10^{-3}$). Whereas, ions show a prominent sub-diffusive behavior associated with the DIH during the non-equilibrium phase for the Coulomb potential. The DIH mechanism is explained using a model based upon the conservation of energy. However, for weakly ionized plasmas ($\chi_i \le 10^{-4}$), the maximum ion temperatures are almost similar for both potentials. Furthermore, electron screening affects the separation distance and arrangement of the ion-neutral pairs for all the values of $\chi_i$. In general, Yukawa potential results in a lower mean potential energy of the interacting particles, which is energetically favourable for the stability of the system.</description>

      <title>Infra-red thermographic inversion in ST40</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infra-red (IR) thermography is an essential diagnostic tool for understanding the edge plasma behavior in fusion devices. In this work, we present a new in-house numerical tool, Functional Analysis of Heat Flux (FAHF), for IR thermographic inversion on Tokamak Energy's spherical tokamak (ST40). FAHF, written in Python, is designed for multi-2D thermographic inversions by solving the heat conduction equation within the divertor tiles using the finite difference method, and an explicit time stepping scheme. Utilising IR camera data with the highest available effective spatial resolution, FAHF calculates the plasma perpendicular heat flux density on the divertor tile surfaces -- a crucial quantity for edge plasma analysis. The tool's internal numerics is first verified through formal time and space convergence analyses, and further corroborated by an energy balance assessment. Although FAHF demonstrates significant sensitivity to user-selected spatial resolution, precise heat flux values are recoverable by ensuring a sufficiently high resolution. Implications for the optimal resolution of both the code and the diagnostic system are discussed. Finally, FAHF's model and geometry simplifications are confirmed to be accurate within 10%, based on comparison with COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. As such, FAHF is proven to be a precise and accurate tool for IR thermographic inversions in ST40.</description>

      <title>Analytic model of stable shock-like structures in laser interaction with underdense plasma for identifying of phase and polarization dependent regime of laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical model describing a stable shock-like structure that is formed when an ultra-intense laser propagates through an underdense plasma. It is shown that such structures exist in a wide range of laser-plasma parameters, with a unique sub-luminal shock front velocity for each parameter. Numerical methods to accurately describe such shock-front is developed. The formalism is applied to describe the parameter space in which the Carrier-Envelope-Phase (CEP) effect under which phase and polarization dependent super-ponderomotive effects becomes significant. The developed formalism will enable quick identification of regimes in which CEP effects become significant, expediting designing of Laser Wakefield Accelerators operating in the superponderomotive regime.</description>

      <title>A novel understanding of the role of plasma-molecular kinetics on divertor power exhaust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During detachment, a buffer of neutral atoms and molecules builds up between the target and the ionising plasma. Collisions between the plasma and the molecules play an important role in the detachment process. Studies of plasma-molecular kinetics indicate that the gas temperature is increased during detachment for a wide range of conditions on the MAST-U and TCV tokamaks. This is related to an increased $\mathrm{D}_2$ lifetime during detachment, leading to more plasma-molecule collisions that raise the molecular temperature. Such collisions subsequently result in significant power and momentum losses to the divertor plasma during detachment. Using a simplified inference, these losses are estimated using the rotational temperature, neutral pressure and ionisation front position. Significant power losses (about $10\%$ of $P_{SOL}$) and dominant momentum losses (majority of the upstream pressure) from plasma-molecule collisions are inferred experimentally in long-legged, strongly baffled, detached divertors (MAST-U Super-X divertor), consistent with SOLPS-ITER simulations. The vibrational distribution obtained is compared with an Eirene-like collisional-radiative model setup, indicating some qualitative agreements and disagreements, potentially highlighting model gaps.
  These interpretations highlight the importance of plasma-molecular collisions, leading to power and momentum losses during detachment. Our analysis and reduced modelling of these processes provide further insights into detachment control observations, the workings of long-legged divertors and divertor power balance.</description>

      <title>Interaction of the Prominence Plasma within the Magnetic Cloud of an ICME with the Earth's Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic cloud within an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) is characterized by high magnetic field intensities. In this study, we investigate the interaction of a magnetic cloud carrying a density structure with the Earth's bow shock during the ICME event on 24 April 2023. Elevated abundances of cold protons and heavier ions, namely alpha particles and singly charged helium ions, associated with the prominence plasma are observed within this structure. The plasma downstream of the bow shock exhibits an irregular compression pattern which could be due to the presence of heavy ions. Heavy ions carry a significant fraction of the upstream flow energy; however, due to their different charge per mass ratio and rigidity, they are less scattered by the electromagnetic and electrostatic waves at the shock. We find that downstream of the shock, while the thermal ion energy is only a small fraction of the background magnetic energy density, nevertheless increased ion fluxes reduce the characteristic wave speeds in the that region. As such, we observe a transition state of an unstable bow shock layer across which the plasma flow is super Alfv\'enic in both upstream and downstream regions. Our findings help with understanding the intense space weather impacts of such events.</description>
