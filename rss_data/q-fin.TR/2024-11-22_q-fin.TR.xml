      <title>Composing Ensembles of Instrument-Model Pairs for Optimizing Profitability in Algorithmic Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets are nonlinear with complexity, where different types of assets are traded between buyers and sellers, each having a view to maximize their Return on Investment (ROI). Forecasting market trends is a challenging task since various factors like stock-specific news, company profiles, public sentiments, and global economic conditions influence them. This paper describes a daily price directional predictive system of financial instruments, addressing the difficulty of predicting short-term price movements. This paper will introduce the development of a novel trading system methodology by proposing a two-layer Composing Ensembles architecture, optimized through grid search, to predict whether the price will rise or fall the next day. This strategy was back-tested on a wide range of financial instruments and time frames, demonstrating an improvement of 20% over the benchmark, representing a standard investment strategy.</description>

      <title>High resolution microprice estimates from limit orderbook data using hyperdimensional vector Tsetlin Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an error-correcting model for the microprice, a high-frequency estimator of future prices given higher order information of imbalances in the orderbook. The model takes into account a current microprice estimate given the spread and best bid to ask imbalance, and adjusts the microprice based on recent dynamics of higher price rank imbalances. We introduce a computationally fast estimator using a recently proposed hyperdimensional vector Tsetlin machine framework and demonstrate empirically that this estimator can provide a robust estimate of future prices in the orderbook.</description>

      <title>Does the square-root price impact law belong to the strict universal scalings?: quantitative support by a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>

      <title>Calculating Profits and Losses for Algorithmic Trading Strategies: A Short Guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of equations that track the total realized and unrealized profits and losses at any time, incorporating the spread. The resulting formalism is ideally suited to evaluate the performance of trading model algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Random Forest approach to detect and identify Unlawful Insider Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to The Exchange Act, 1934 unlawful insider trading is the abuse of access to privileged corporate information. While a blurred line between "routine" the "opportunistic" insider trading exists, detection of strategies that insiders mold to maneuver fair market prices to their advantage is an uphill battle for hand-engineered approaches. In the context of detailed high-dimensional financial and trade data that are structurally built by multiple covariates, in this study, we explore, implement and provide detailed comparison to the existing study (Deng et al. (2019)) and independently implement automated end-to-end state-of-art methods by integrating principal component analysis to the random forest (PCA-RF) followed by a standalone random forest (RF) with 320 and 3984 randomly selected, semi-manually labeled and normalized transactions from multiple industry. The settings successfully uncover latent structures and detect unlawful insider trading. Among the multiple scenarios, our best-performing model accurately classified 96.43 percent of transactions. Among all transactions the models find 95.47 lawful as lawful and $98.00$ unlawful as unlawful percent. Besides, the model makes very few mistakes in classifying lawful as unlawful by missing only 2.00 percent. In addition to the classification task, model generated Gini Impurity based features ranking, our analysis show ownership and governance related features based on permutation values play important roles. In summary, a simple yet powerful automated end-to-end method relieves labor-intensive activities to redirect resources to enhance rule-making and tracking the uncaptured unlawful insider trading transactions. We emphasize that developed financial and trading features are capable of uncovering fraudulent behaviors.</description>
