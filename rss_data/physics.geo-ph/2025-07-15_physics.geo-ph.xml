      <title>Resonant Seismic Motion Within a Sedimentary Basin Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem, of 2D canonical nature, examined herein in the space-frequency framework, concerns a SH-polarized plane body seismic wave propagating in a hard, non lossy half space (bedrock) containing a soft, lossy cylindrical basin of semi-circular shape. The displacement response, at points both within and outside the basin is represented alternatively in integral (for basins of general shape) and partial wave (for basins of semi-circular shape) forms, the integral representation leading to an expression of a sort of conservation of energy relation, and an explanation of how the energetic gain provided by the incident wave, is divided essentially into two sources of loss: radiation damping (taking place in the bedrock) and volumic material damping (taking place within the basin), whereas the partial wave representation enables a detailed theoretical demonstration of the resonant nature of the response, marked by amplification and concentration of the displacement field essentially within the basin at certain (eigen-)frequencies and very little, or no amplification and concentration, at other frequencies. These phenomena carry over to the volumic material damping and radiation damping loss functions (of frequency), with the equivalent of resonant displacement response residing in peaks of the volumic material damping loss function and troughs of the radiation damping loss function. Maps, for the semi-circular basin, are computed herein of the displacement field both at resonant and non-resonant frequencies which strongly evoke those (of numerical nature resulting from the boundary element scheme) appearing in two publications by other authors for basins of more realistic shape, so as to suggest that the results in the present study are applicable, for a large part, to basins of general shape.</description>

Abstract: Water vapour is highly subsaturated in much of the Earth's atmosphere. This has important consequences for water vapour feedback, and also for general phenomena such as the runaway greenhouse. In this chapter, we discuss the processes that create subsaturation, with reference to both observations, general circulation models, and a range of idealized theoretical models which produce subsaturation. While this chapter focuses on subsaturation of water vapour in Earth's atmosphere, the processes discussed are generic to condensible substances in all planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>From images to properties: a NeRF-driven framework for granular material parameter inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations. These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.</description>

      <title>Capturing Unseen Spatial Extremes Through Knowledge-Informed Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed records of climate extremes provide an incomplete picture of risk, missing "unseen" extremes that exceed historical bounds. In parallel, neglecting spatial dependence undervalues the risk of synchronized hazards that amplify impacts. To address these challenges, we develop DeepX-GAN (Dependence-Enhanced Embedding for Physical eXtremes - Generative Adversarial Network), a knowledge-informed deep generative model designed to better capture the spatial structure of rare extremes. The zero-shot generalizability of DeepX-GAN enables simulation of unseen extremes that fall outside historical experience yet remain statistically plausible. We define two types of unseen extremes: "checkmate" extremes that directly hit targets, and "stalemate" extremes that narrowly miss. These unrealized scenarios expose latent risks in fragile systems and may reinforce a false sense of resilience if overlooked. Near misses, in particular, can prompt either proactive adaptation or dangerous complacency, depending on how they are interpreted. Applying DeepX-GAN to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), we find that these unseen extremes disproportionately affect regions with high vulnerability and low socioeconomic readiness, but differ in urgency and interpretation. Future warming could expand and redistribute these unseen extremes, with emerging exposure hotspots in Indo-Pakistan and Central Africa. This distributional shift highlights critical blind spots in conventional hazard planning and underscores the need to develop spatially adaptive policies that anticipate emergent risk hotspots rather than simply extrapolating from historical patterns.</description>

      <title>Updated Earth Tomography Using Atmospheric Neutrinos at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a sample of high purity, primarily atmospheric, muon neutrino events over 11 years from all directions below the horizon, spanning the energy range 500 GeV to 100 TeV. While this sample was initially used for an eV-scale sterile neutrino search, its purity and spanned parameter space can also be used to perform an earth tomography. This flux of neutrinos traverses the earth and is attenuated in varying amounts depending on the energy and traversed column density of the event. By parameterizing the earth as multiple constant--density shells, IceCube can measure the upgoing neutrino flux as a function of the declination, yielding an inference of the density of each shell. In this talk, the latest sensitivities of this analysis and comparisons with the previous measurement are presented. In addition, the analysis procedure, details about the data sample, and systematic effects are also explained. This analysis is one of the latest, weak-force driven, non-gravitational, measurements of the earth's density and mass.</description>

      <title>Enhanced DeepONet for 1-D consolidation operator learning: an architectural investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have emerged as a powerful surrogate modeling framework for learning solution operators in PDE-governed systems. While their use is expanding across engineering disciplines, applications in geotechnical engineering remain limited. This study systematically evaluates several DeepONet architectures for the one-dimensional consolidation problem. We initially consider three architectures: a standard DeepONet with the coefficient of consolidation embedded in the branch net (Models 1 and 2), and a physics-inspired architecture with the coefficient embedded in the trunk net (Model 3). Results show that Model 3 outperforms the standard configurations (Models 1 and 2) but still has limitations when the target solution (excess pore pressures) exhibits significant variation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Trunknet Fourier feature-enhanced DeepONet (Model 4) that addresses the identified limitations by capturing rapidly varying functions. All proposed architectures achieve speedups ranging from 1.5 to 100 times over traditional explicit and implicit solvers, with Model 4 being the most efficient. Larger computational savings are expected for more complex systems than the explored 1D case, which is promising. Overall, the study highlights the potential of DeepONets to enable efficient, generalizable surrogate modeling in geotechnical applications, advancing the integration of scientific machine learning in geotechnics, which is at an early stage.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate-and-state, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</description>

      <title>Constructing Extreme Heatwave Storylines with Differentiable Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model, NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, our method produces heatwave intensity up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns-hallmarks of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather under climate change.</description>
