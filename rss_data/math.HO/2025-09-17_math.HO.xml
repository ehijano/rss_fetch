      <title>The Path to Aperiodic Monotiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article, written for undergraduate mathematics students, provides an accessible introduction to a few key problems in tiling theory: Heesch's problem, the isohedral number problem, and the existence of an aperiodic monotile. I contributed to the solution of the last of these problems in 2023, but many related questions remain open and worthy of study. My goal is to get more students excited about studying tiling theory.</description>

      <title>More Shapes of Central Quadrilaterals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let E be a point in the plane of a convex quadrilateral ABCD. The lines from E to the vertices of the quadrilateral form four triangles. If we locate a triangle center in each of these triangles, the four triangle centers form another quadrilateral called a central quadrilateral. For each of various shaped quadrilaterals, and each of 1000 different triangle centers, and for various choices for E, we examine the shape of the central quadrilateral. Using a computer, we determine when the central quadrilateral has a special shape, such as being a rhombus or a cyclic quadrilateral. A typical result is the following. Let E be the centroid of equidiagonal quadrilateral ABCD. Let F, G, H, and I be the X(591)-points of triangles ABE, BCE, CDE, and DAE, respectively. Then FGHI is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral</description>

      <title>Euler's explorations of extremal ellipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1770s, Euler wrote a series of papers (E563, E691 and E692) about finding the ellipse with minimal area or perimeter in the family of all ellipses passing through a fixed set of points. This is a translation of all three papers from the original Latin, together with a commentary which discusses Euler's results and an appendix which addresses a question from E691 which Euler left for others to consider.</description>

      <title>Boolos' Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever can be solved in no less than three admissible questions: axiomatic framework and rigorous proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.05677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A formal axiomatic mathematical framework for Boolos' Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever is presented and two theorems about its solvability are proved. By strictly following Boolos' instructions (in particular, the requirement that all gods are always obliged to answer), the novel concept of \textit{admissible questions} for the puzzle is introduced. It is then rigorously proved that Boolos' original puzzle can be solved, in an absolute deterministic way, in no less than three yes-no admissible questions. However, this does not mean that one could solve it in less than three admissible questions by just pure \emph{chance}. Hence, such probabilities are computed here as well.</description>
