      <title>Monitoring arc-geodetic sets of oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring edge-geodetic sets in a graph are subsets of vertices such that every edge of the graph must lie on all the shortest paths between two vertices of the monitoring set. These objects were introduced in a work by Foucaud, Krishna and Ramasubramony Sulochana with relation to several prior notions in the area of network monitoring like distance edge-monitoring.
  In this work, we explore the extension of those notions unto oriented graphs, modelling oriented networks, and call these objects monitoring arc-geodetic sets. We also define the lower and upper monitoring arc-geodetic number of an undirected graph as the minimum and maximum of the monitoring arc-geodetic number of all orientations of the graph. We determine the monitoring arc-geodetic number of fundamental graph classes such as bipartite graphs, trees, cycles, etc. Then, we characterize the graphs for which every monitoring arc-geodetic set is the entire set of vertices, and also characterize the solutions for tournaments. We also cover some complexity aspects by studying two algorithmic problems. We show that the problem of determining if an undirected graph has an orientation with the minimal monitoring arc-geodetic set being the entire set of vertices, is NP-hard. We also show that the problem of finding a monitoring arc-geodetic set of size at most $k$ is $NP$-complete when restricted to oriented graphs with maximum degree $4$.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph rewriting and Causal structure of $\lambda-$calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study hypergraph rewriting in categorical terms in an attempt to define the notion of events and develop foundations of causality in graph rewriting. We introduce novel concepts within the framework of double-pushout rewriting in adhesive categories. Secondly, we will study the notion of events in $\lambda-$calculus, wherein we construct an algorithm to determine causal relations between events following the evaluation of a $\lambda-$expression satisfying certain conditions. Lastly, we attempt to extend this definition to arbitrary $\lambda-$expressions.</description>

      <title>Static Nuel Games with Terminal Payoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a variant of the Nuel game (a generalization of the duel) which is played in turns by $N$ players. In each turn a single player must fire at one of the other players and has a certain probability of hitting and killing his target. The players shoot in a fixed sequence and when a player is eliminated, the ``move'' passes to the next surviving player. The winner is the last surviving player. We prove that, for every $N\geq2$, the Nuel has a stationary Nash equilibrium and provide algorithms for its computation.</description>

      <title>Orientable and negative orientable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., a range of methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets; some of these methods involve using negative orientable sequences as a building block. In this paper we describe three techniques for generating such negative orientable sequences, as well as upper bounds on their period. We then go on to show how these negative orientable sequences can be used to generate orientable sequences with period close to the maximum possible for every non-binary alphabet size and for every tuple length. In doing so we use two closely related approaches described by Alhakim et al.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of the independence polynomials of $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph if $n\geq p$ and every $p$ pairwise disjoint independent sets of $G$ are contained within $p$ pairwise disjoint maximum independent sets. In this paper, we establish that every $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph $G$ is $p$-quasi-regularizable if and only if $n\geq (p+1)\alpha $, where $\alpha $ is the independence number of $G$. This finding ensures that the independence polynomial of a connected $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph $G$ is log-concave whenever $(p+1)\alpha \leq n\leq 2p\alpha +p+1$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the independence polynomial of the clique corona $G\circ K_{p}$ is invariably log-concave for all $p\geq 1$. As an application, we validate a long-standing conjecture claiming that the independence polynomial of a very well-covered graph is unimodal.</description>

      <title>The Price of Upwardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Not every directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is planar admits an upward planar drawing. We are interested in pushing the notion of upward drawings beyond planarity by considering upward $k$-planar drawings of DAGs in which the edges are monotonically increasing in a common direction and every edge is crossed at most $k$ times for some integer $k \ge 1$. We show that the number of crossings per edge in a monotone drawing is in general unbounded for the class of bipartite outerplanar, cubic, or bounded pathwidth DAGs. However, it is at most two for outerpaths and it is at most quadratic in the bandwidth in general. From the computational point of view, we prove that upward-$k$-planarity testing is NP-complete already for $k =1$ and even for restricted instances for which upward planarity testing is polynomial. On the positive side, we can decide in linear time whether a single-source DAG admits an upward $1$-planar drawing in which all vertices are incident to the outer face.</description>

      <title>Graphons of Line Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graphon is the limit of a converging graph sequence. Graphons of dense graphs are useful as they can act as a blueprint and generate graphs of arbitrary size with similar properties. But for sparse graphs this is not the case. Sparse graphs converge to the zero graphon, making the generated graphs empty or edgeless. Thus, the classical graphon definition fails for sparse graphs. Several methods have been proposed to overcome this limitation and to understand sparse graphs more deeply. However, the fragile nature of sparse graphs makes these methods mathematically complex. In this paper we show a simple method that can shed light on a certain subset of sparse graphs. The method involves mapping the original graphs to their line graphs. Line graphs map edges to vertices and connects edges when edges in the original graph share a vertex. We show that graphs satisfying a particular property, which we call the square-degree property are sparse, but give rise to dense line graphs. In particular, star graphs satisfy the square-degree property resulting in dense line graphs and non-zero graphons of line graphs. Similarly, superlinear preferential attachment graphs give rise to dense line graphs almost surely. In contrast, dense graphs, including Erdos-Renyi graphs make the line graphs sparse, resulting in the zero graphon.</description>

      <title>Record-biased permutations and their permuton limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study a non-uniform distribution on permutations biased by their number of records that we call \emph{record-biased permutations}. We give several generative processes for record-biased permutations, explaining also how they can be used to devise efficient (linear) random samplers. For several classical permutation statistics, we obtain their expectation using the above generative processes, as well as their limit distributions in the regime that has a logarithmic number of records (as in the uniform case). Finally, increasing the bias to obtain a regime with an expected linear number of records, we establish the convergence of record-biased permutations to a deterministic permuton, which we fully characterize.
  This model was introduced in our earlier work [N. Auger, M. Bouvel, C. Nicaud, C. Pivoteau, \emph{Analysis of Algorithms for Permutations Biased by Their Number of Records}, AofA 2016], in the context of realistic analysis of algorithms. We conduct here a more thorough study but with a theoretical perspective.</description>

      <title>Holes in Convex and Simple Drawings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gons and holes in point sets have been extensively studied in the literature. For simple drawings of the complete graph a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem is known and empty triangles have been investigated. We introduce a notion of $k$-holes for simple drawings and study their existence with respect to the convexity hierarchy. We present a family of simple drawings without 4-holes and prove a generalization of Gerken's empty hexagon theorem for convex drawings. A crucial intermediate step will be the structural investigation of pseudolinear subdrawings in convex~drawings.</description>

      <title>Intersection Graphs with and without Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph class $\mathcal{G}$ admits product structure if there exists a constant $k$ such that every $G \in \mathcal{G}$ is a subgraph of $H \boxtimes P$ for a path $P$ and some graph $H$ of treewidth $k$. Famously, the class of planar graphs, as well as many beyond-planar graph classes are known to admit product structure. However, we have only few tools to prove the absence of product structure, and hence know of only a few interesting examples of classes. Motivated by the transition between product structure and no product structure, we investigate subclasses of intersection graphs in the plane (e.g., disk intersection graphs) and present necessary and sufficient conditions for these to admit product structure. Specifically, for a set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (e.g., a disk) and a real number $\alpha \in [0,1]$, we consider intersection graphs of $\alpha$-free homothetic copies of $S$. That is, each vertex $v$ is a homothetic copy of $S$ of which at least an $\alpha$-portion is not covered by other vertices, and there is an edge between $u$ and $v$ if and only if $u \cap v \neq \emptyset$. For $\alpha = 1$ we have contact graphs, which are in most cases planar, and hence admit product structure. For $\alpha = 0$ we have (among others) all complete graphs, and hence no product structure. In general, there is a threshold value $\alpha^*(S) \in [0,1]$ such that $\alpha$-free homothetic copies of $S$ admit product structure for all $\alpha &gt; \alpha^*(S)$ and do not admit product structure for all $\alpha &lt; \alpha^*(S)$. We show for a large family of sets $S$, including all triangles and all trapezoids, that it holds $\alpha^*(S) = 1$, i.e., we have no product structure, except for the contact graphs (when $\alpha= 1$). For other sets $S$, including regular $n$-gons for infinitely many values of $n$, we show that $0 &lt; \alpha^*(S) &lt; 1$ by proving upper and lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Improving the Crossing Lemma by Characterizing Dense 2-Planar and 3-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Crossing Lemma by Ajtai et al.~and Leighton from 1982 gave an important lower bound of $c \frac{m^3}{n^2}$ for the number of crossings in any drawing of a given graph of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The original value was $c= 1/100$, which then has gradually been improved. Here, the bounds for the density of $k$-planar graphs played a central role. Our new insight is that for $k=2,3$ the $k$-planar graphs have substantially fewer edges if specific local configurations that occur in drawings of $k$-planar graphs of maximum density are forbidden. Therefore, we are able to derive better bounds for the crossing number $\text{cr}(G)$ of a given graph $G$. In particular, we achieve a bound of $\text{cr}(G) \ge \frac{73}{18}m-\frac{305}{18}(n-2)$ for the range of $5n &lt; m \le 6n$, while our second bound $\text{cr}(G) \ge 5m - \frac{407}{18}(n-2)$ is even stronger for larger $m&gt;6n$.
  For $m &gt; 6.79n$, we finally apply the standard probabilistic proof from the BOOK and obtain an improved constant of $c&gt;1/27.61$ in the Crossing Lemma. Note that the previous constant was $1/29$. Although this improvement is not too impressive, we consider our technique as an important new tool, which might be helpful in various other applications.</description>

      <title>Cost-sharing in Parking Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the total displacement statistic of parking functions from the perspective of cooperative game theory. We introduce parking games, which are coalitional cost-sharing games in characteristic function form derived from the total displacement statistic. We show that parking games are supermodular cost-sharing games, indicating that cooperation is difficult (i.e., their core is empty). Next, we study their Shapley value, which formalizes a notion of "fair" cost-sharing and amounts to charging each car for its expected marginal displacement under a random arrival order. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Shapley value of parking games, in contrast with known hardness results on computing the Shapley value of arbitrary games. The algorithm leverages the permutation-invariance of total displacement, combinatorial enumeration, and dynamic programming. We conclude with open questions around an alternative solution concept for supermodular cost-sharing games and connections to other areas in combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of random structures with $n$-element domains over a relational signature, we define its first order (FO) complexity as a certain subset in the Banach space $\ell^{\infty}/c_0$. The well-known FO zero-one law and FO convergence law correspond to FO complexities equal to $\{0,1\}$ and a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, respectively. We present a hierarchy of FO complexity classes, introduce a stochastic FO reduction that allows to transfer complexity results between different random structures, and deduce using this tool several new logical limit laws for binomial random structures. Finally, we introduce a conditional distribution on graphs, subject to a FO sentence $\varphi$, that generalises certain well-known random graph models, show instances of this distribution for every complexity class, and prove that the set of all $\varphi$ validating 0--1 law is not recursively enumerable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study half-space separation in the convexity of chordless paths of a graph, i.e., monophonic convexity. In this problem, one is given a graph and two (disjoint) subsets of vertices and asks whether these two sets can be separated by complementary convex sets, called half-spaces. While it is known this problem is $\mathbf{NP}$-complete for geodesic convexity -- the convexity of shortest paths -- we show that it can be solved in polynomial time for monophonic convexity.</description>

      <title>On the minimum spectral radius of connected graphs of given order and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a question of Hong from 1993 related to the minimum spectral radii of the adjacency matrices of connected graphs of given order and size. Hong asked if it is true that among all connected graphs of given number of vertices $n$ and number of edges $e$, the graphs having minimum spectral radius (the minimizer graphs) must be almost regular, meaning that the difference between their maximum degree and their minimum degree is at most one. In this paper, we answer Hong's question positively for various values of $n$ and $e$ and in several cases, we determined the graphs with minimum spectral radius.</description>

      <title>On Symmetries of Finite Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isospectral set of the Dirac matrix D=d+d* consists of orthogonal Q for which Q* D Q is an equivalent Dirac matrix. It can serve as the symmetry of a finite geometry G. The symmetry is a subset of the orthogonal group or unitary group and isospectral Lax deformations produce commuting flows d/dt D=[B(g(D)),D] on this symmetry space. In this note, we remark that like in the Toda case, D_t=Q_t* D_0 Q_t with exp(-t g(D))=Q_t R_t solves the Lax system.</description>
