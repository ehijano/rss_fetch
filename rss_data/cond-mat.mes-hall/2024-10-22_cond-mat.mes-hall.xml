      <title>Strong photon coupling to high-frequency antiferromagnetic magnons via topological surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show strong coupling between antiferromagnetic magnons and microwave cavity photons at both high and externally controllable magnon frequencies. Using the fully quantum mechanical path-integral method, we study an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM) interfaced with a topological insulator (TI), taking Bi$_2$Se$_3$--MnSe as a representative example. We show that the mutual coupling of the spin-polarized surface states of the TI to both the squeezed magnons and the circularly polarized cavity photons results in a Chern-Simons term that activates the stronger electric, rather than magnetic, dipole coupling. Moreover, a squeezing-mediated enhancement of the coupling is achieved due to the unequal interfacial exchange coupling to the AFM sublattices, resulting in a coupling strength up to several orders stronger than for direct magnon-photon coupling. While direct cavity-AFM coupling has so far been limited in its applicability due to weak or low frequency coupling, this result may advance the utilization of high-frequency cavity magnonics and enable its incorporation into quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Transport properties and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a one-dimensional electronic nanodevice inspired in recently fabricated semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator (SE-SC-FMI) hybrid heterostructures, and investigate its zero-temperature transport properties. While previous related studies have primarily focused on the potential for generating topological superconductors hosting Majorana fermions, we propose an alternative application: using these hybrids to explore controllable quantum phase transitions (QPTs) detectable through transport measurements. Our study highlights two key differences from existing devices: first, the length of the FMI layer is shorter than that of the SE-SC heterostructure, introducing an inhomogeneous Zeeman interaction with significant effects on the induced Andreev bound states (ABS). Second, we focus on semiconductor nanowires with minimal or no Rashba spin-orbit interaction, allowing for the induction of spin-polarized ABS and high-spin quantum ground states. We show that the device can be tuned across spin- and fermion parity-changing QPTs by adjusting the FMI layer length orange and/or by applying a global backgate voltage, with zero-energy crossings of subgap ABS as signatures of these transitions. Our findings suggest that these effects are experimentally accessible and offer a robust platform for studying quantum phase transitions in hybrid nanowires.</description>

      <title>Airborne Biomarker Localization Engine (ABLE) for Open Air Point-of-Care Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike biomarkers in biofluids, airborne biomarkers are dilute and difficult to trace. Detecting diverse airborne biomarkers with sufficient sensitivity typically relies on bulky and expensive equipment like mass spectrometers that remain inaccessible to the general population. Here, we introduce Airborne Biomarker Localization Engine (ABLE), a simple, affordable, and portable platform that can detect both volatile, non-volatile, molecular, and particulate biomarkers in about 15 minutes. ABLE significantly improves gas detection limits by converting dilute gases into droplets by water condensation, producing concentrated aqueous samples that are easy to be tested. Fundamental studies of multiphase condensation revealed unexpected stability in condensate-trapped biomarkers, making ABLE a reliable, accessible, and high-performance system for open-air-based biosensing applications such as non-contact infant healthcare, pathogen detection in public space, and food safety.</description>

      <title>Blocking transition of SrTiO$_3$ surface dipoles in MoS$_2$/SrTiO$_3$ field effect transistors with counterclockwise hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A counterclockwise hysteresis is observed at room temperature in the transfer characteristics of SrTiO$_3$ (STO) gated MoS$_2$ field effect transistor (FET) and attributed to bistable dipoles on the STO surface. The hysteresis is expectedly found to increase with increasing range, as well as decreasing rate, of the gate-voltage sweep. The hysteresis peaks near 350 K while the transconductance rises with rising temperature above the room temperature. This is attributed to a blocking transition arising from an interplay of thermal energy and an energy-barrier that separates the two dipole states. The dipoles are discussed in terms of the displacement of the puckered oxygen ions at the STO surface. Finally, the blocking enables a control on the threshold gate-voltage of the FET over a wide range at low temperature which demonstrates it as a heat assisted memory device.</description>

      <title>Structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of single graphyne layers based on a 2D biphenylene network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is a promising material for the development of applications in nanoelectronic devices, but the lack of a band gap necessitates the search for ways to tune its electronic properties. In addition to doping, defects, and nanoribbons, a more radical alternative is the development of 2D forms with structures that are in clear departure from the honeycomb lattice, such as graphynes, with the distinctive property of involving carbon atoms with both hybridizations sp and sp2. The density and details of how the acetylenic links are distributed allow for a variety of electronic signatures. Here we propose a graphyne system based on the recently synthesized biphenylene monolayer. We demonstrate that this system features highly localized states with a spin-polarized semiconducting configuration. We study its stability and show that the system's structural details directly influence its highly anisotropic electronic properties. Finally, we show that the symmetry of the frontier states can be further tuned by modulating the size of the acetylenic chains forming the system.</description>

      <title>Robust topological interface states in a lateral magnetic-topological heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing uniform magnetic order in two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) by constructing heterostructures of TI and magnet is a promising way to realize the high-temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall effect. However, the topological properties of 2D materials are susceptible to several factors that make them difficult to maintain, and whether topological interfacial states (TISs) can exist at magnetic-topological heterostructure interfaces is largely unknown. Here, we experimentally show that TISs in a lateral heterostructure of CrTe_{2}/Bi(110) are robust against disorder, defects, high magnetic fields (time-reversal symmetry breaking perturbations), and elevated temperature (77 K). The lateral heterostructure is realized by lateral epitaxial growth of bilayer (BL) Bi to monolayer CrTe_{2} grown on HOPG. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy demonstrate a black phosphorus-like structure with low atomic buckling (less than 0.1 {\AA}) of the BL Bi(110), indicating the presence of its topological properties. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and energy-dependent dI/dV mapping further confirm the existence of topologically induced one-dimensional in-gap states localized at the interface. These results demonstrate the robustness of TISs in lateral magnetic-topological heterostructures, which is competitive with those in vertically stacked magnetic-topological heterostructures, and provides a promising route for constructing planar high-density non-dissipative devices using TISs.</description>

      <title>Electron-hole pair production in graphene for two arbitrarily polarized electric fields with a time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The momentum distributions of electron-hole (EH) pair production in graphene for two arbitrarily polarized electric fields with a time delay are investigated employing a massless quantum kinetic equation and compared with the results obtained in electron-positron (EP) pair production from vacuum. For a single elliptically polarized electric field, the momentum distributions of created EH and EP pairs are similar in multiphoton absorption region. However, for two co-directional linearly polarized electric fields with a time delay and no field frequency, the momentum distribution of created EH pairs exhibits ring patterns, which is not present in EP pair production. For two circularly polarized fields with identical or opposite handedness, the momentum distributions of created EH pairs also show Ramsey interference and spiral structures, respectively. Different from EP pair production, the spiral structures are insensitive to the number of oscillation cycles in electric field pulses. For two elliptically polarized fields with same-sign or opposite-sign ellipticity, the momentum distributions of EH pairs are much more insensitive to ellipticity than those in EP pair production. These results provide further theoretical reference for simulating the EP pair production from vacuum in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>The twisting dynamics of large lattice mismatch van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) homo-/hetero-structures are ideal systems for studying interfacial tribological properties such as structural superlubricity. Previous studies concentrated on the mechanism of translational motion in vdW interfaces. However, detailed mechanisms and general properties of the rotational motion are barely explored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to reveal the twisting dynamics of the MoS$_2$/graphite heterostructure. Unlike the translational friction falling into the superlubricity regime with no twist angle dependence, the dynamic rotational resistances highly depend on twist angles. Our results show that the periodic rotational resistance force originates from structural potential energy changes during the twisting. The structural potential energy of MoS$_2$/graphite heterostructure increases monotonically from0 to 30 degrees twist angles, and the estimated relative energy barrier is (1.43 +/- 0.36) x 10 J/m. The formation of Moir\'e superstructures in the graphene layer is the key to controlling the structural potential energy of the MoS$_2$/graphene heterostructure. Our results suggest that in twisting 2D heterostructures, even if the interface sliding friction is negligible, the evolving potential energy change results in a non-vanishing rotational resistance force. The structural change of the heterostructure can be an additional pathway for energy dissipation in the rotational motion, further enhancing the rotational friction force.</description>

      <title>A 300 mm foundry silicon spin qubit unit cell exceeding 99% fidelity in all operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication of quantum processors in advanced 300 mm wafer-scale complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) foundries provides a unique scaling pathway towards commercially viable quantum computing with potentially millions of qubits on a single chip. Here, we show precise qubit operation of a silicon two-qubit device made in a 300 mm semiconductor processing line. The key metrics including single- and two-qubit control fidelities exceed 99% and state preparation and measurement fidelity exceeds 99.9%, as evidenced by gate set tomography (GST). We report coherence and lifetimes up to $T_\mathrm{2}^{\mathrm{*}} = 30.4$ $\mu$s, $T_\mathrm{2}^{\mathrm{Hahn}} = 803$ $\mu$s, and $T_1 = 6.3$ s. Crucially, the dominant operational errors originate from residual nuclear spin carrying isotopes, solvable with further isotopic purification, rather than charge noise arising from the dielectric environment. Our results answer the longstanding question whether the favourable properties including high-fidelity operation and long coherence times can be preserved when transitioning from a tailored academic to an industrial semiconductor fabrication technology.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topology in twisted multilayer systems: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) across various disciplines within the field of physics. These unique phases are characterized by their ability to harbor topological protected boundary states at lower-dimensional boundaries, a distinguishing feature that sets them apart from conventional topological phases and is attributed to the higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence. Two-dimensional (2D) twisted systems offer an optimal platform for investigating HOTPs, owing to their strong controllability and experimental feasibility. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest research advancements on HOTPs in 2D twisted multilayer systems. We will mainly review the HOTPs in electronic, magnonic, acoustic, photonic and mechanical twisted systems, and finally provide a perspective of this topic.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric Manipulation and Engineering for Layertronics in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic transport characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) systems have widespread application prospects in the fabrication of multifunctional nanodevices. However, the current research for basic transport phenomena, such as anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) and piezoelectric response, is limited to discrete discussion. Here, we theoretically propose a valley-piezoelectricity coupling strategy beyond the existing paradigm to realize AVHE and layer Hall effect (LHE) in ferrovalley (FV) systems, and its essential principle can be extended to general valleytronic materials. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the large polarized electric field of 2.8*106 (1.67*107) V/m can be induced by 0.1% uniaxial strain in FV 2H-LaHF (1T-LaHF) monolayers. In addition, the microscopic mechanism of interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) state of 2H-LaHF bilayer is uncovered by the spin Hamiltonian and super-superexchange (SSE) interaction. Our findings pave the way for new explorations of valley Hall-related effect involving piezoelectricity.</description>

      <title>Possible way to achieve anomalous valley Hall effect by tunable intrinsic piezoelectric polarization in FeO$_2$SiGeN$_2$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valley-related multiple Hall effect and piezoelectric response are novel transport characteristics in low-dimensional system, however few studies have reported their coexistence in a single system as well as their coupling relationships. By first-principles calculations, we propose a multifunctional Janus semiconductor, i.e. FeO$_2$SiGeN$_2$ monolayer with large valley polarization of about 120 meV and in-plane piezoelectric polarization with d11 of -0.714.03 pm/V. The magnetic anisotropy energy can be significantly regulated by electronic correlation strength and strain, which can be attributed to the change of competition relationship about Fe-3d-resolved magnetic anisotropy energy brought about by external regulatory means. Electronic correlation strength can induce phase transitions in Janus FeO$_2$SiGeN$_2$ monolayer from ferrovalley to quantum anomalous Hall phase, while the half-valley metallic state as the boundary of the phase transition can gererate 100% spin- and valley polarization. The related phase transition mechanism is analyzed based on the two-band strained kp model. The presence of piezoelectric strain coefficients d11 in valleytronic material makes the coupling between charge degrees of freedom and valley degrees of freedom possible, and the intrinsic electric field caused by the in-plane piezoelectric response provide the way to realize piezoelectric anomalous valley Hall effect. This work may pave a way to find a new member of materials with valley-related multiple Hall effect and stimulate further experimental works related to valleytronics and piezotronics.</description>

      <title>Backbone Mediated Electrical Transport in a Double-Stranded DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of DNA nanotechnology, it is common wisdom that charge transport occurs through the {\pi} stacked bases in a double-stranded DNA. However, recent experimental findings by Roman Zhuravel et. al. [Nat. Nanotech. 15, 836 (2020)] suggest that it is the backbone channels through which transport happens, not through the nitrogen bases. These new experimental studies call for a detail investigation of these biomolecules from a different perspective. In this article we examine charge transport properties of a double-stranded DNA within a tight-binding framework where the backbones form the main conduction channels. Using techniques based on the Green's function method, we inspect changes in the density of states (DOS) and localization properties of DNA in presence of discontinuities (nicks) along the backbone channels. We also investigate the effect of backbone channel discontinuities on current-voltage (I-V) responses using the Landauer-Buttiker formalism. We study three characteristic DNA sequences, two periodic and one random. We observe that, in all cases, the effects of nicks on the transport properties are similar. Irrespective of the I-V responses of pristine sequences (be it metallic or semiconducting), as soon as we introduce two nicks at two different strands, current is cut-off. Hence we claim that the backbone channel supported charge conduction in DNA is an universal phenomena irrespective of the sequence and its pristine I-V characteristics.</description>

      <title>Integration of Cobalt Ferromagnetic Control Gates for Electrical and Magnetic Manipulation of Semiconductor Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of electron spin qubit architectures for quantum computing processors has led to a strong interest in designing and integrating ferromagnets to induce stray magnetic fields for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The integration of nanomagnets imposes however strict layout and processing constraints, challenging the arrangement of different gating layers and the control of neighboring qubit frequencies. This work reports a successful integration of nano-sized cobalt control gates into a multi-gate FD-SOI nanowire with nanometer-scale dot-to-magnet pitch, simultaneously exploiting electrical and ferromagnetic properties of the gate stack at nanoscale. The electrical characterization of the multi-gate nanowire exhibits full field effect functionality of all ferromagnetic gates from room temperature to 10 mK, proving quantum dot formation when ferromagnets are operated as barrier gates. The front-end-of-line (FEOL) compatible gate-first integration of cobalt is examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high/low frequency capacitance characterization, confirming the quality of interfaces and control over material diffusion. Insights into the magnetic properties of thin films and patterned control-gates are provided by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron holography measurements. Micromagnetic simulations anticipate that this structure fulfills the requirements for EDSR driving for magnetic fields higher than 1 T, where a homogeneous magnetization along the hard magnetic axis of the Co gates is expected. The FDSOI architecture showcased in this study provides a scalable alternative to micromagnets deposited in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) processes, while bringing technological insights for the FEOL-compatible integration of Co nanostructures in spin qubit devices.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical analytical approach to universal spectral correlations in Brownian Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analytical approach to the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlators in zero-dimensional Brownian models of quantum chaos. The approach expresses these spectral correlations as part of a closed hierarchy of differential equations that can be formulated for all system sizes and in each of the three standard symmetry classes (unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic, as determined by the presence and nature of time reversal symmetry). The hierarchy applies exactly, and in the same form, to Dyson's Brownian motion and all systems with stochastically emerging basis invariance, where the model-dependent information is subsumed in a single dynamical timescale whose explicit form we also establish. We further verify this universality numerically for the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, for which we find perfect agreement with the analytical predictions of the symmetry class determined by the number of fermions. This results in a complete analytical description of the spectral correlations and allows us to identify which correlations are universal in a large class of models.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of spin friction and dissipative spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time dynamics of local magnetic moments exchange coupled to a metallic system of conduction electrons is subject to dissipative friction even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Phenomenologically, this is usually described by a local Gilbert damping constant. Here, we use both linear response theory and adiabatic response theory to derive the spin friction microscopically for a generic single-band tight-binding model of the electronic structure. The resulting Gilbert damping is time-dependent and nonlocal. For a one-dimensional model, we compare the emergent relaxation dynamics as obtained from LRT and ART against each other and against the full solution of the microscopic equations of motion and demonstrate the importance of nonlocality, while the time dependence turns out to be irrelevant. In two dimensions and for a few magnetic moments in different geometries, it is found that the inclusion of nonlocal Gilbert damping can counterintuitively lead to longer relaxation times. Besides the distance dependence, the directional dependence of the nonlocal Gilbert damping turns out as very important. Our results are based on an expression relating the nonlocal Gilbert damping to the nonlocal tight-binding density of states close to the Fermi energy. This is exact in case of noninteracting electrons. Effects due to electronic correlations are studied within the random-phase approximation. For the Hubbard model at half filling and with increasing interaction strength, we find a strong enhancement of the nonlocality of spin friction.</description>

      <title>Rotation effects on the graphene wormhole energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in how spinning effects influence the electronic properties of the graphene wormhole. For this purpose, we have described the graphene by the wormhole background based on the model developed by Gonz\'alez and his co-workers. By applying a coordinate transformation in the metric of graphene wormhole, we can introduce rotating effects. In the continuum limit, by solving the massless Dirac equation in the context of a rotating wormhole background, we obtain the Landau levels for the rotating graphene wormhole. We still have exposed the analogy between the graphene wormhole and fermions on the G\"odel-type spacetime.</description>

      <title>Semiconductor Circuits for Quantum Computing with Electronic Wave Packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard approaches to quantum computing require significant overhead to correct for errors. The hardware size for conventional quantum processors in solids often increases linearly with the number of physical qubits, such as for transmon qubits in superconducting circuits or electron spin qubits in quantum dot arrays. While photonic circuits based on flying qubits do not suffer from decoherence or lack of potential scalability, they have encountered significant challenges to overcome photon loss in long delay circuits. Here, we propose an alternative approach that utilizes flying electronic wave packets propagating in solid-state quantum semiconductor circuits. Using a novel time-bin architecture for the electronic wave packets, hardware requirements are drastically reduced because qubits can be created on-demand and manipulated with a common hardware element, unlike the localized approach of wiring each qubit individually. The electronic Coulomb interaction enables reliable coupling and readout of qubits. Improving upon previous devices, we realize electronic interference at the level of a single quantized mode that can be used for manipulation of electronic wavepackets. This important landmark lays the foundation for fault-tolerant quantum computing with a compact and scalable architecture based on electron interferometry in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Imaging supermoire relaxation and conductive domain walls in helical trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In twisted van der Waals materials, local atomic relaxation can significantly alter the underlying electronic structure and properties. Characterizing the lattice reconstruction and the impact of strain is essential to better understand and harness the resulting emergent electronic states. Here, we use a scanning single-electron transistor to image spatial modulations in the electronic structure of helical trilayer graphene, demonstrating relaxation into a superstructure of large domains with uniform moire periodicity. We further show that the supermoire domain size is enhanced by strain and can even be altered in subsequent measurements of the same device, while nevertheless maintaining the same local electronic properties within each domain. Finally, we observe higher conductance at the boundaries between domains, consistent with the prediction that they host counter-propagating topological edge modes. Our work confirms that lattice relaxation can produce moire-periodic order in twisted multilayers, demonstrates strain-engineering as a viable path for designing topological networks at the supermoire scale, and paves the way to direct imaging of correlation-driven topological phases and boundary modes.</description>

      <title>Multimode vibrational coupling across the insulator-to-metal transition in 1T-TaS$_{2}$ in THz cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of optical cavities on resonance with material excitations allows controlling light-matter interaction in both the regimes of weak and strong coupling. We study here the multimode vibrational coupling of low energy phonons in the charge-density-wave material 1T-TaS$_{2}$ across its insulator-to-metal phase transition. For this purpose, we embed 1T-TaS$_{2}$ into THz Fabry-P\'erot cryogenic cavities tunable in frequency within the spectral range of the vibrational modes of the insulating phase and track the linear response of the coupled phonons across the insulator-to-metal transition. In the low temperature dielectric state, we reveal the signatures of a multimode vibrational strong collective coupling. The observed polariton modes inherit character from all the vibrational resonances as a consequence of the cavity-mediated hybridization. We reveal that the vibrational strong collective coupling is suppressed across the insulator-to-metal transition as a consequence of the phonon-screening induced by the free charges. Our findings emphasize how the response of cavity-coupled vibrations can be modified by the presence of free charges, uncovering a new direction toward the tuning of coherent light-matter interaction in cavity-confined correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Universal Vibrational Anharmonicity in Carbyne-like Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbyne, an infinite linear chain of carbon atoms, is the truly one-dimensional allotrope of carbon. While ideal carbyne and its fundamental properties have remained elusive, carbyne-like materials like carbyne chains confined inside carbon nanotubes are available for study. Here, we probe the longitudinal optical phonon (C-mode) of confined carbyne chains by Raman spectroscopy up to the third overtone. We observe a strong vibrational anharmonicity that increases with decreasing C-mode frequency, reaching up to 8% for the third overtone. Moreover, we find that the relation between vibrational anharmonicity and C-mode frequency is universal to carbyne-like materials, including ideal carbyne. This establishes experimentally that carbyne and related materials have pronounced anharmonic potential landscapes which must be included in the theoretical description of their structure and properties.</description>

      <title>Cooperative non-reciprocal emission and quantum sensing of symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal propagation of energy and information is fundamental to a wide range of quantum technology applications. In this work, we explore the quantum many-body dynamics of a qubit ensemble coupled to a shared bath that mediates coherent and dissipative inter-qubit interactions with both symmetric and anti-symmetric components. We find that the interplay between anti-symmetric (symmetric) coherent and symmetric (anti-symmetric) dissipative interactions results in non-reciprocal couplings, which, in turn, generate a spatially asymmetric emission pattern. We demonstrate that this pattern arises from non-reciprocal interactions coupling different quantum many-body states within a specific excitation manifold. Focusing on solid-state baths, we show that their lack of time-reversal and inversion symmetry is a key ingredient for generating non-reciprocal dynamics in the qubit ensemble. With the plethora of quantum materials that exhibit this symmetry breaking at equilibrium, our approach paves the way for realizing cooperative non-reciprocal transport in qubit ensembles without requiring time-modulated external drives or complex engineering. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to a generic non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic bath as a concrete example, we demonstrate that our predictions can be tested in near-future experiments. As the spatial asymmetry in the relaxation dynamics of the qubit ensemble is a direct probe of symmetry breaking in the solid-state bath, our work also opens the door to developing model-agnostic quantum sensing schemes capable of detecting bath properties invisible to current state-of-the-art protocols, which operate solid-state defects as single-qubit sensors.</description>

      <title>NeuralMAG: Fast and Generalizable Micromagnetic Simulation with Deep Neural Nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micromagnetics has made significant strides, particularly due to its wide-ranging applications in magnetic storage design. Numerical simulation is a cornerstone of micromagnetics research, relying on first-principle rules to compute the dynamic evolution of micromagnetic systems based on the renowned LLG equation, named after Landau, Lifshitz, and Gilbert. However, simulations are often hindered by their slow speed. Although Fast-Fourier transformation (FFT) calculations reduce the computational complexity to O(NlogN), it remains impractical for large-scale simulations. In this paper, we introduce NeuralMAG, a deep learning approach to micromagnetic simulation. Our approach follows the LLG iterative framework but accelerates demagnetizing field computation through the employment of a U-shaped neural network (Unet). The Unet architecture comprises an encoder that extracts aggregated spins at various scales and learns the local interaction at each scale, followed by a decoder that accumulates the local interactions at different scales to approximate the global convolution. This divide-and-accumulate scheme achieves a time complexity of O(N), significantly enhancing the speed and feasibility of large-scale simulations. Unlike existing neural methods, NeuralMAG concentrates on the core computation rather than an end-to-end approximation for a specific task, making it inherently generalizable. To validate the new approach, we trained a single model and evaluated it on two micromagnetics tasks with various sample sizes, shapes, and material settings.</description>

      <title>Moment method and continued fraction expansion in Floquet Operator Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recursion methods such as Krylov techniques map complex dynamics to an effective non-interacting problem in one dimension. For example, the operator Krylov space for Floquet dynamics can be mapped to the dynamics of an edge operator of the one-dimensional Floquet inhomogeneous transverse field Ising model (ITFIM), where the latter, after a Jordan-Wigner transformation, is a Floquet model of non-interacting Majorana fermions, and the couplings correspond to Krylov angles. We present an application of this showing that a moment method exists where given an autocorrelation function, one can construct the corresponding Krylov angles, and from that the corresponding Floquet-ITFIM. Consequently, when no solutions for the Krylov angles are obtained, it indicates that the autocorrelation is not generated by unitary dynamics. We highlight this by studying certain special cases: stable $m$-periodic dynamics derived using the method of continued fractions, exponentially decaying and power-law decaying stroboscopic dynamics. Remarkably, our examples of stable $m$-periodic dynamics correspond to $m$-period edge modes for the Floquet-ITFIM where deep in the chain, the couplings correspond to a critical phase. Our results pave the way to engineer Floquet systems with desired properties of edge modes and also provide examples of persistent edge modes in gapless Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Skin Effect Along Hyperbolic Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been revealed that a variety of novel phenomena emerge in hyperbolic spaces, while non-Hermitian physics has significantly enriched the landscape of condensed matter physics. Building on these developments, we construct a geodesic-based method to study the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in non-reciprocal hyperbolic lattices. Additionally, we develop a geodesic-periodic boundary condition (geodesic-PBC), akin to the Euclidean periodic boundary condition (PBC), that complements its open boundary condition. Importantly, we find that the non-reciprocal directionality within a hyperbolic regular polygon and the geodesic-based boundary determine the spectral sensitivity, and hence, the NHSE. Unlike in Euclidean models, however, we must utilize boundary localization to distinguish non-trivial skin modes from their trivial boundary counterpart due to the extensive boundary volume of hyperbolic lattices. We also relate the spatial density profile with the finite-size scaling of hyperbolic lattices. These aspects highlight the profound impact of hyperbolic geometry on non-Hermitian systems and offer new perspectives on the intricate relationship between the geometric characteristics of hyperbolic lattices and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Facile synthesis of palladium hydride via ionic gate-driven protonation using a deep eutectic solvent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing novel protocols for hydrogen (H) loading is crucial for furthering the investigation of hydrides as potential high-temperature superconductors at lower pressures compared to recent discoveries. Ionic gating-induced protonation (IGP) has emerged as a promising technique for H loading due to its inherent simplicity, but it can be limited in the maximum density of injected H when ionic liquids are used as a gating medium. Here, we demonstrate that large H concentrations can be successfully injected in both palladium (Pd) bulk foils and thin films (up to a stoichiometry PdH$_{0.89}$) by using a choline chloride-glycerol deep eutectic solvent (DES) as gate electrolyte and applying gate voltages in excess of the cathodic stability limit. The attained H concentrations are large enough to induce superconductivity in Pd, albeit with an incomplete resistive transition which suggests a strongly inhomogeneous H incorporation in the Pd matrix. This DES-based IGP protocol can be used as a guideline for maximizing H loading in different materials, although specific details of the applied voltage profile might require adjustments based on the material under investigation.</description>

This thermal analog of the inverse spin Hall effect is analyzed in magneto-optical networks exhibiting C4 symmetry, under the action of spatially variable external magnetic fields. This finding opens new avenues for thermal management and energy conversion with non-reciprocal systems through a localized and dynamic control of the spin angular momentum of light.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scheme for the construction of deformed matrix geometries using Landau models. The level projection method cannot be applied straightforwardly to extract matrix geometries to the Landau models on deformed manifolds, as they do not generally exhibit degenerate energy levels (Landau levels). We overcome this problem by exploiting the idea of spectral flow. Taking a symmetric matrix geometry as a reference point of the spectral flow, we evolve the matrix geometry by deforming the Landau model. In this process, unitarity is automatically preserved. The explicit matrix realization of the coordinates is derived straightforwardly even for a non-perturbative deformation. We clarify the basic properties of the matrix geometries through the analysis of concrete models. The matrix geometries of an expanding two-sphere and ellipsoids are investigated using the non-relativistic and relativistic Landau models. The obtained ellipsoidal matrix geometries show behavior quantitatively different in each Landau level, but qualitatively similar to their classical counterpart. The difference between the ellipsoidal matrix geometry and the fuzzy ellipsoid is investigated numerically.</description>

      <title>Undulated 2D materials as a platform for large Rashba spin-splitting and persistent spin-helix states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with large unidirectional Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), resulting in persistent-spin helix states with small spin-precession length, are critical for advancing spintronics. We demonstrate a design principle achieving it through specific undulations of 2D materials. Analytical model and first-principles calculations reveal that bending-induced asymmetric hybridization brings about and even enhances Rashba SOC. Its strength $\alpha_R \propto \kappa$ (curvature) and shifting electronic levels $\Delta \propto \kappa^2$. Despite the vanishing integral curvature of typical topographies, implying a net-zero Rashba effect, our two-band analysis and electronic structure calculation of a bent 2D MoTe$_2$ show that only an interplay of $\alpha_R$ and $\Delta$ modulations results in large unidirectional Rashba SOC with well-isolated states. Their high spin-splitting $\sim 0.16$ eV, and attractively small spin-precession length $\sim 1$ nm, are among the best known. Our work uncovers major physical effects of undulations on Rashba SOC in 2D materials, opening new avenues for using their topographical deformation for spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: 2D non-van der Waals (vdW) Cr5Te8 has attracted widespread research interest for its air stability and thickness-dependent magnetic properties. However, exploring new methods for growing larger-scale ultrathin 2D Cr5Te8 remains challenging. Here, we selected GaTe powder as precursor to supply Te monomers and fabricated large-scale 2D Cr5Te8 nanosheets. By optimizing the growth temperature and source-substrate distance (DSS), we successfully achieved Cr5Te8 nanosheets with lateral sizes of up to ~0.19 mm and corresponding thicknesses down to ~4.8 nm. The role of GaTe enhances the efficient Te atoms concentration, which promoted the lateral growth of Cr5Te8 nanosheets. Furthermore, our findings reveal the presence of Cr5Te8 nanosheets exhibiting serrated edges and a stacked structure like wedding cakes. Magnetic property measurement revealed the intense out-of-plane ferromagnetism in Cr5Te8, with the Curie temperature (TC) of 172 K. This work paves a way for the controllable growth of the submillimeter ultrathin 2D ferromagnetic crystalline and lays the foundation for the future synthesis of millimeter ultrathin ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing the inverted phase of a WSe$_2$/BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructure via hydrostatic pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG) was recently shown to host a band-inverted phase with unconventional topology emerging from the Ising-type spin--orbit interaction (SOI) induced by the proximity of transition metal dichalcogenides with large intrinsic SOI. Here, we report the stabilization of this band-inverted phase in BLG symmetrically encapsulated in tungsten-diselenide (WSe$_2$) via hydrostatic pressure. Our observations from low temperature transport measurements are consistent with a single particle model with induced Ising SOI of opposite sign on the two graphene layers. To confirm the strengthening of the inverted phase, we present thermal activation measurements and show that the SOI-induced band gap increases by more than 100% due to the applied pressure. Finally, the investigation of Landau level spectra reveals the dependence of the level-crossings on the applied magnetic field, which further confirms the enhancement of SOI with pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the electronic transport properties of a three-terminal graphene Josephson junction. We find that self-heating effects strongly influence the behaviour of this multiterminal Josephson junction (MTJJ) system. We show that existing simulation methods based on resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction networks can be significantly improved by taking into account these heating effects. We also investigate the phase dynamics in our MTJJ by measuring its switching current distribution and find correlated switching events in different junctions. We show that the switching dynamics is governed by phase diffusion at low temperatures. Furthermore, we find that self-heating introduces additional damping which results in overdamped I-V characteristics when normal and supercurrents coexist in the device.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz law violation domain for graphene and nonrelativistic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systematic and comparative research on Lorenz ratios for graphene and nonrelativistic systems has been studied to identify their Wiedemann-Franz law violation domain. Fermi energy and temperature are the main governing parameters for deciding the values of the Lorenz ratio, which is basically thermal conductivity divided by electrical conductivity times temperature times Lorenz number. Metals as three-dimensional nonrelativistic electron gas locate at higher Fermi-energy by temperature domain, where Lorenz ratio remains one. Hence, they obey the Wiedemann-Franz law. By creating higher doping in a two-dimensional graphene system, one can again reach a higher Fermi-energy by temperature domain and get a constant Lorenz ratio. For both graphene and non-relativistic systems, the Lorenz ratio goes below one if we go lower Fermi-energy by temperature domain, which is possible for the graphene system by decreasing the doping concentration. Experimentally observed greater than one Lorenz ratio in this lower Fermi-energy by temperature domain or Dirac Fluid domain indicates that non-fluid expressions of Lorenz ratio should be replaced by fluid-type expressions. We have noticed a divergent trend of Lorenz ratio in the Dirac Fluid domain using its fluid-type expression, and it matches with the trend of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of spin Nernst effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the microscopic theory of the spin Nernst effect, which is a transverse spin current directly induced by a temperature gradient, employing the linear response theory with Luttinger's gravitational potential method. We consider a generic, non-interacting electron system with randomly distributed impurities and evaluate the spin current response to the gravitational potential. Our theory takes into account a contribution of the local equilibrium current modified by Luttinger's gravitational potential and is thus consistent with the thermodynamic principle that thermal responses should vanish. The Ward-Takahashi identities ensure that the spin Nernst current is well-behaved at low temperatures in any order of the random impurity potentials. Furthermore, we microscopically derive the spin-current version of Mott's formula, which associates the spin Nernst coefficient with the spin Hall conductivity. The spin-current version of the St\v{r}eda formula is also discussed. To demonstrate these findings, the spin Nernst current of three-dimensional Dirac electrons is computed. Our theory is general and can therefore be extended to interacting electron systems, where Mott's formula no longer holds.</description>

      <title>Janus graphene nanoribbons with a single ferromagnetic zigzag edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological design of pi-electrons in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) leads to a wealth of magnetic quantum phenomena and exotic quantum phases. Symmetric ZGNRs typically exhibit antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a new class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the 1D limit, but also establishes a long-sought carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics. However, designing such GNRs entails overcoming daunting challenges, including simultaneous breaking of structural and spin symmetries, and designing elegant precursors for asymmetric fabrication of reactive zigzag edges. Here, we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb's theorem and topological classification theory, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introduced a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin symmetry breaking. Three Z-shape precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the defective edge. Characterization via scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of Janus GNRs with ferromagnetic ground state delocalised along the pristine zigzag edge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optical effect of chiral topological superconductors in two dimensions. The linear optical response from chiral Bogoliubov edge modes in clean superconductors has in-gap resonances, which is originated from the transitions within the edge particle-hole pair bands. Interestingly, the number of resonance peaks is determined by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern number of topological superconductors. Such a sharply distinctive feature in optical absorption offers a simple way to distinguish topological superconductors with different Chern numbers. We further demonstrate that linear optical effect could probe different topological phases in quantum anomalous Hall insulator-superconductor junction devices. This finding provides an applicable method to detect chiral Bogoliubov edge states and is distinguishable from collective modes in superconductors and possible trivial explanations.</description>

      <title>Signatures of sliding Wigner crystals in bilayer graphene at zero and finite magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AB-stacked bilayer graphene has emerged as a fascinating yet simple platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena of correlated electrons. Unexpectedly, a phase with negative dR/dT has recently been observed when a large electric displacement field is applied and the charge carrier density is tuned to the vicinity of an ultra-low-density van Hove singularity. This phase exhibits features consistent with Wigner crystallization, including a characteristic temperature dependence and non-linear current bias behavior. However, more direct evidence for the emergence of an electron crystal in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at zero magnetic field remains elusive. Here we explore the low-frequency noise consistent with depinning and sliding of a Wigner crystal lattice. The current bias and frequency dependence of these noise spectra align well with findings from previous experimental and theoretical studies on the quantum electron solids. Our results offer transport signatures consistent with Wigner crystallization in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at zero and finite magnetic fields, paving the way for further substantiating an anomalous Hall crystal in its original form.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the precision of currents in a generic multi-terminal quantum-transport setting. Employing scattering theory, we show that the precision of the currents is limited by a function of the particle-current noise that can be interpreted as the activity in the classical limit. We thereby establish a kinetic uncertainty relation for quantum transport. In the full quantum limit, we find precision bounds in which we modify the activity constraints depending on whether the system is fermionic or bosonic. We expect these bounds to be guidelines for any transport process aiming at high precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09009v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in topological Josephson junctions. By both analytic and numerical calculations, we find that while a Josephson junction in the topological phase may exhibit higher diode efficiency compared to that in the trivial phase, this behavior is not universal. The presence of Majorana bound states is not a sufficient condition for a large diode effect. Furthermore, the diode efficiency undergoes substantial changes only in specific regions along the topological phase transition boundary, and a significant diode effect does coincide with the topological phases. Thereby our paper suggests the utilization of topological superconductivity for enhanced JDE, and also the Josephson diode effect may serve as an indicator for topological superconductor phase. These results suggest a nuanced relationship between the topological aspects of Josephson junctions and Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian physics has attracted considerable attention, current studies are limited to small or classically solvable systems. Quantum computing, as a powerful eigensolver, have predominantly been applied to Hermitian domain, leaving their potential for studying non-Hermitian problems largely unexplored. We extend the power of quantum computing to general non-Hermitian eigenproblems. Our approach works for finding eigenvalues without extra constrains, or eigenvalues closest to specified points or lines, thus extending results for ground energy and energy gap problems for Hermitian matrices. Our algorithms have broad applications, and as examples, we consider two central problems in non-Hermitian physics. Firstly, our approach is the first to offer an efficient quantum solution to the witness of spontaneous $PT$-symmetry breaking, and provide provable, exponential quantum advantage. Secondly, our approach enables the estimation of Liouvillian gap, which is crucial for characterizing relaxation times. Our general approach can also find applications in many other areas, such as the study of Markovian stochastic processes. These results underscore the significance of our quantum algorithms for addressing practical eigenproblems across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>A call for frugal modelling: two case studies involving molecular spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $&gt;4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key question in the thermodynamics of open quantum systems is how to partition thermodynamic quantities such as entropy, work, and internal energy between the system and its environment. We show that the only partition under which entropy is nonsingular is based on a partition of Hilbert space, which assigns half the system-environment coupling to the system and half to the environment. However, quantum work partitions nontrivially under Hilbert-space partition, and we derive a work sum rule that accounts for quantum work at a distance. All state functions of the system are shown to be path independent once this nonlocal quantum work is properly accounted for. Our results are illustrated with application to a driven resonant level strongly coupled to a reservoir.</description>

      <title>Hydroelectric energy conversion of waste flows through hydroelectronic drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20209</link>

Abstract: Hydraulic energy is a key component of the global energy mix, yet there exists no practical way of harvesting it at small scales, from flows at low Reynolds number. This has triggered the search for alternative hydroelectric conversion methodologies, leading to unconventional proposals based on droplet triboelectricity, water evaporation, osmotic energy or flow-induced ionic Coulomb drag. Yet, these approaches systematically rely on ions as intermediate charge carriers, limiting the achievable power density. Here, we predict that the kinetic energy of small-scale "waste" flows can be directly and efficiently converted into electricity thanks to the hydro-electronic drag effect, by which an ion-free liquid induces an electronic current in the solid wall along which it flows. This effect originates in the fluctuation-induced coupling between fluid motion and electron transport. We develop a non-equilibrium thermodynamic formalism to assess the efficiency of such hydroelectric energy conversion, dubbed hydronic energy. We find that hydronic energy conversion is analogous to thermoelectricity, with the efficiency being controlled by a dimensionless figure of merit. However, in contrast to its thermoelectric analogue, this figure of merit combines independently tunable parameters of the solid and the liquid, and can thus significantly exceed unity. Our findings suggest new strategies for blue energy harvesting without electrochemistry, and for waste flow mitigation in membrane-based filtration processes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Polarization in One-dimensional Aperiodic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By implementing a charge pumping scheme for one-dimensional aperiodic chains, we confirm the existence of topological phases in these systems whenever their finite-size realizations admit inversion symmetry. These phases are usually characterized by an anomalous edge response as a result of the bulk-boundary correspondence. We show that these signatures are all present in various chains, each representing a different class of structural aperiodicity: the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Tribonacci quasicrystal, and the Thue-Morse chain. More specifically, we calculate three quantities: the Berry phase of the crystalline approximation of the finite-size systems, the polarization response to an inifintesimal static and constant electric field in systems with open boundary conditions, and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. We find that all of them provide signatures of a topologically nontrivial phase.</description>

      <title>Gate-controlled proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of 2D materials opens up unprecedented opportunities to design new materials with specified properties. In many cases, the design guiding principle is based on one or another proximity effect, i.e. the nanoscale-penetration of electronic correlations from one material to another. In a few layer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures the proximity regions occupy the entire system. Here we demonstrate that the physics of magnetic and superconducting proximity effects in 2D superconductor/ferromagnet vdW heterostructures is determined by the effects of interface hybridization of the electronic spectra of both materials. The degree of hybridization can be adjusted by gating, which makes it possible to achieve a high degree of controllability of the proximity effect. In particular, we show that this allows for electrical switching of superconductivity in such structures on and off, as well as for control of the amplitude and sign of the Zeeman splitting of superconducting spectra, opening interesting opportunities for spintronics and spin caloritronics.</description>

      <title>Effects of Self-Hybridized Exciton-Polaritons on WS2 Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitonic semiconductors such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are attractive for next-generation photovoltaics (PVs) with low cost, light weight, and low material consumption. In WS2 and other TMDCs, the simultaneous large optical constants and strong exciton resonance can result in the primary photogenerated species being self-hybridized exciton-polaritons emerging from the strong coupling of excitons and optical cavity modes formed by the WS2. We show that strong coupling can benefit photovoltaic performance, with external quantum efficiencies and power conversion efficiencies enhanced by an order of magnitude, approaching values of 55 and 2%, respectively. Thickness dependent device characterization is performed to study the polariton dispersion, revealing anomalous internal quantum efficiency and fill factor behavior that are attributed to polariton-modified exciton transport processes. Our results uncover a significant mechanism in the photoconversion process for PVs from high index, excitonic semiconductors and indicate the utility of strong coupling for optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Design Rules for Tunable Emission in Graphene Quantum Dots: A High-Throughput TDDFT and Machine Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of fluorescence emission energies for 284 distinct graphene quantum dots (GQDs) of varying shapes (square, hexagonal, and amorphous) and sizes ($\sim$1-2 nm). These GQDs are doped with one or two elements from B, N, O, S, and P at dopant percentages of 1.5%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Our study systematically investigates the trends and patterns in emission energies as a function of shape, size, dopant type and dopant percentage. Twelve structures are identified to have emission wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The emission energies derived from our calculations can guide the formulation of specific GQD mixtures to achieve desired emission spectra within and beyond the visible range for industrial applications. Furthermore, the extensive dataset, including emission energies along with molecular structures generated in this work, creates a DFT dateset for further machine learning studies.</description>

      <title>Anomalous radiation reaction in a circularly polarized field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics in a circularly polarized electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron rotating under the field leads to the quantum recoil force acting on the electron perpendicularly to the velocity of its forward movement, which differs crucially from the known classical recoil force directed oppositely to the velocity. Physically, such an anomalous radiation reaction arises from the one-loop QED correction to the photon emission and has no analogue within the classical electrodynamics. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for electrons in strong laser fields.</description>

      <title>Atomically Flat Dielectric Patterns for Band Gap Engineering and Lateral Junction Formation in MoSe$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining a precise sputter etching method with subsequent AlO$_x$ growth within an atomic layer deposition chamber enables fabrication of atomically flat lateral patterns of SiO$_2$ and AlO$_x$. The transfer of MoSe$_2$ monolayers onto these dielectrically modulated substrates results in formation of lateral heterojunctions, with the flat substrate topography leading to minimal strain across the junction. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements show significant variations in the contact potential difference (CPD) across the interface, with AlO$_x$ regions inducing a 230~mV increase in CPD. Spatially resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals shifts in spectral weight of neutral and charged exciton species across the different dielectric regions. On the AlO$_x$ side, the Fermi energy moves closer to the conduction band, leading to a higher trion-to-exciton ratio, indicating a bandgap shift consistent with CPD changes. In addition, transient reflection spectroscopy highlights the influence of the dielectric environment on carrier dynamics, with the SiO$_2$ side exhibiting rapid carrier decay typical of neutral exciton recombination. In contrast, the AlO$_x$ side shows slower, mixed decay behavior consistent with conversion of trions back into excitons. These results demonstrate how dielectric substrate engineering can tune the electronic and optical characteristics of proximal two-dimensional materials, allowing scalable fabrication of advanced junctions for novel (opto)electronics applications.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>General recipe for immediate entanglement death-birth transitions via Bell states: environmental Heisenberg exchange as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environment is known to play a dual role in both extinguishing and establishing entanglement, leading to entanglement sudden death (ESD) and entanglement sudden birth (ESB). In this paper, we propose a recipe for the initial states of two qubits to undergo ESD, ESB, or transition of finite duration (TFD) between them. While this recipe is \emph{generally independent of the interaction}, a spin-star model with environmental Heisenberg exchange is chosen for illustration. Utilizing the Bell states, we introduce the entanglement switch parameter (ESP), whose sign indicates whether the qubit bipartite entanglement is switched on or off. The classical (quantum) weighting of the Bell states encodes the ESP for initial mixed (pure) states. When more than two Bell states are adopted, the ESP permits states to penetrate through the entanglement-unentanglement boundary. In this case, the penetrability of a small ESP ensures the immediate occurrence of ESD or ESB and indicates the TFD if the local time-even symmetry in the entanglement monotone is also satisfied. When no more than two Bell states are employed, the penetrability is lost, and TFD is only identified in some mixed states but not in pure states; here for pure states, the environmental quantum degrees of freedom are associated with the number of Bell states. Thanks to the simplicity of this model, analytic results are provided. We also analyze the symmetries that can convert or alter ESD into ESB, and vice versa. The recipe enhances the controllability of entanglement dynamics and facilitates entanglement engineering.</description>
