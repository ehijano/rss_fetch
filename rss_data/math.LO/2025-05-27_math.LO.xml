      <title>Stratifications and term description over valued fields with analytic structure, uniform Yomdin-Gromov parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a certain strong smooth stratification of sets and a term description of functions, which are definable over valued fields (possibly non algebraically closed) with separated analytic structure. The basic tools are: elimination of valued field quantifiers, term structure of definable functions, Lipschitz cell decomposition with preparation of $RV$-parametrized sets, and a non-Archimedean definable version of Bierstone-Milman's canonical desingularization algorithm, achieved in an earlier paper of ours. As application, we give uniform Yomdin-Gromov parametrizations over Henselian fields $K$ with separated analytic structure.</description>

      <title>A Sequent Calculus Perspective on Base-Extension Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define base-extension semantics (Bes) using atomic systems based on sequent calculus rather than natural deduction. While traditional Bes aligns naturally with intuitionistic logic due to its constructive foundations, we show that sequent calculi with multiple conclusions yield a Bes framework more suited to classical semantics. The harmony in classical sequents leads to straightforward semantic clauses derived solely from right introduction rules. This framework enables a Sandqvist-style completeness proof that extracts a sequent calculus proof from any valid semantic consequence. Moreover, we show that the inclusion or omission of atomic cut rules meaningfully affects the semantics, yet completeness holds in both cases.</description>

      <title>The Theory of the Unique Latent Pattern: A Formal Epistemic Framework for Structural Singularity in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Theory of the Unique Latent Pattern (ULP), a formal epistemic framework that redefines the origin of apparent complexity in dynamic systems. Rather than attributing unpredictability to intrinsic randomness or emergent nonlinearity, ULP asserts that every analyzable system is governed by a structurally unique, deterministic generative mechanism, one that remains hidden not due to ontological indeterminacy, but due to epistemic constraints. The theory is formalized using a non-universal generative mapping \( \mathcal{F}_S(P_S, t) \), where each system \( S \) possesses its own latent structure \( P_S \), irreducible and non-replicable across systems. Observed irregularities are modeled as projections of this generative map through observer-limited interfaces, introducing epistemic noise \( \varepsilon_S(t) \) as a measure of incomplete access. By shifting the locus of uncertainty from the system to the observer, ULP reframes chaos as a context-relative failure of representation. We contrast this position with foundational paradigms in chaos theory, complexity science, and statistical learning. While they assume or model shared randomness or collective emergence, ULP maintains that every instance harbors a singular structural identity. Although conceptual, the theory satisfies the criterion of falsifiability in the Popperian sense, it invites empirical challenge by asserting that no two systems governed by distinct latent mechanisms will remain indistinguishable under sufficient resolution. This opens avenues for structurally individuated models in AI, behavioral inference, and epistemic diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Axiomatizing approximate inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two approximate variants of inclusion dependencies and examine the axiomatization and computational complexity of their implication problems. The approximate variants allow for some imperfection in the database and differ in how this degree is measured. One considers the error relative to the database size, while the other applies a fixed threshold independent of size. We obtain complete axiomatizations for both under some arity restrictions. In particular, restricted to unary inclusion dependencies, the implication problem for each approximate variant is decidable in PTIME. We formalise the results using team semantics, where a team corresponds to a uni-relational database.</description>

      <title>On ordered groups of regular growth rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an elementary class of linearly ordered groups, called growth order groups, encompassing certain groups under composition of formal series (e.g. transseries) as well as certain groups $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{M}}$ of infinitely large germs at infinity of unary functions definable in an o-minimal structure $\mathcal{M}$. We study the algebraic structure of growth order groups and give methods for constructing examples. We show that if $\mathcal{M}$ expands the real ordered field and germs in $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{M}}$ are levelled in the sense of Marker &amp; Miller, then $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{M}}$ is a growth order group.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures arising from the finite condensation on linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite condensation $\sim_F$ is an equivalence relation defined on a linear order $L$ by $x \sim_F y$ if and only if the set of points lying between $x$ and $y$ is finite. We define an operation $\cdot_F$ on linear orders $L$ and $M$ by $L \cdot_F M = \operatorname{o.t.}\left((LM)/\!\sim_F\right)$; that is, $L \cdot_F M$ is the order type of the lexicographic product of $L$ and $M$ modulo the finite condensation. The infinite order types $L$ such that $L / \! \sim_F\, \cong 1$ are $\omega, \omega^*,$ and $\zeta$ (where $\omega^*$ is the reverse ordering of $\omega$, and $\zeta$ is the order type of $\mathbb{Z}$). We show that under the operation $\cdot_F$, the set $R=\{1, \omega, \omega^*, \zeta\}$ forms a left rectangular band. Further, each of the ordinal elements of $R$ defines, via left or right multiplication modulo the finite condensation, a weakly order-preserving map on the class of ordinals. We study these maps' effect on the ordinals of finite degree in Cantor normal form. In particular, we examine the extent to which one of these maps, sending $\alpha$ to the order type of $\alpha$ modulo the finite condensation, behaves similarly to a derivative operator on the ordinals of finite degree in Cantor normal form.</description>

      <title>Modal logic for reasoning about uncertainty and confusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a modal logic that can formalise statements about uncertainty and beliefs such as `I think that my wallet is in the drawer rather than elsewhere' or `I am confused whether my appointment is on Monday or Tuesday'. To do that, we expand G\"{o}del modal logic $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G}$ with the involutive negation $\sim$ defined as $v({\sim}\phi,w)=1-v(\phi,w)$. We provide semantics with the finite model property for our new logic that we call $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ and show its equivalence to the standard semantics over $[0,1]$-valued Kripke models. Namely, we show that $\phi$ is valid in the standard semantics of $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ iff it is valid in the new semantics. Using this new semantics, we construct a constraint tableaux calculus for $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ that allows for an explicit extraction of countermodels from complete open branches and then employ the tableaux calculus to obtain the PSpace-completeness of the validity in $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$.</description>

      <title>Hyperfiniteness for group actions on trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify natural conditions for a countable group acting on a countable tree which imply that the orbit equivalence relation of the induced action on the Gromov boundary is Borel hyperfinite. Examples of this condition include acylindrical actions. We also identify a natural weakening of the aforementioned conditions that implies measure hyperfinitenss of the boundary action. We then document examples of group actions on trees whose boundary action is not hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>Atomic Toposes with Co-Well-Founded Categories of Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The atoms of the Schanuel topos can be described as the pairs $(n,G)$ where $n$ is a finite set and $G$ is a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(n)$. We give a general criterion on an atomic site ensuring that the atoms of the topos of sheaves on that site can be described in a similar fashion. We deduce that these toposes are locally finitely presentable. By applying this to the Malitz-Gregory atomic topos, we obtain a counter-example to the conjecture that every locally finitely presentable topos has enough points. We also work out a combinatorial property satisfied exactly when the sheaves for the atomic topology are the pullback-preserving functors. In this case, the category of atoms is particularly simple to describe.</description>

      <title>Temporal Model On Quantum Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical framework for modeling temporal memory dynamics, combining concepts from temporal logic, memory decay models, and hierarchical contexts. The framework formalizes the evolution of propositions over time using linear and branching temporal models, incorporating exponential decay (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve) and reactivation mechanisms via Bayesian updating. The hierarchical organization of memory is represented using directed acyclic graphs to model recall dependencies and interference. Novel insights include feedback dynamics, recursive influences in memory chains, and the integration of entropy-based recall efficiency. This approach provides a foundation for understanding memory processes across cognitive and computational domains.</description>

      <title>Inclusion with repetitions and Boolean constants -- implication problems revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inclusion dependencies form one of the most widely used dependency classes. We extend existing results on the axiomatization and computational complexity of their implication problem to two extended variants. We present an alternative completeness proof for standard inclusion dependencies and extend it to inclusion dependencies with repetitions that can express equalities between attributes. The proof uses only two values, enabling us to work in the Boolean setting. Furthermore, we study inclusion dependencies with Boolean constants, provide a complete axiomatization and show that no such system is k-ary. Additionally, the decision problems for both extended versions remain PSPACE-complete. The extended inclusion dependencies examined are common in team semantics, which serves as the formal framework for the results.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Evidence from Analyst Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less-known role in representing subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.</description>
