      <title>Asymptotic Effects of Incident Angle and Lateral Conduction in Electromagnetic Skin Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously we derived the leading term asymptotic solution of temperature distribution in skin heating by an electromagnetic beam at an arbitrary incident angle. The asymptotic analysis is based on that the penetration depth of the beam into skin is much smaller than the size of beam cross-section. It allows arbitrary incident angle. We expand the temperature in powers of the small depth to lateral scale ratio. The incident angle affects all terms in the expansion while the lateral heat conduction appears only in terms of positive even powers. The previously obtained leading term solution captures only the main effect of incident angle. The main effect of lateral heat conduction is contained in the second order term, which is mathematically negligible in the limit of small depth to lateral scale ratio. At a moderate length scale ratio (e.g., 0.1), however, the contribution from lateral conduction is quite significant and needs to be included in a meaningful approximate solution. In this study, we derive closed form analytical expressions for the first order and the second order terms in the asymptotic expansion. The resulting asymptotic solution is capable of predicting the temperature distribution accurately including the effects of both incident angle and lateral heat conduction even at a moderate length scale ratio.</description>

      <title>Influence of electrical properties on thermal boundary conductance at metal/semiconductor interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental investigations have demonstrated that doping a semiconductor is a route to increase the thermal boundary conductance at metal/semiconductor interfaces. In this work, the influence of the electrical properties on heat transfer across metal/doped semiconductor junctions is investigated. Specifically, thermal boundary conductance at the interfaces between p- and n-doped silicon and titanium is measured by employing frequency-domain photothermal radiometry under varying external conditions. The influence of the doping level of the semiconductor, the barrier height, and the space charge area is analyzed. In particular, a 40% increase in the interface thermal conductance with the application of a current at n-doped silicon/titanium interfaces is reported. The enhancement of the thermal boundary conductance is explained by the shrinking of the surface charga area induced by the electric current. This study opens the way to modulating interfacial heat transfer at metal/semiconductor interfaces through fine tuning of electrical effects.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Schild solutions in Multigravity and the Classical Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the multimetric theory of gravitation, also known as multigravity. We derive additional new exact solutions for the theory in proportional Kerr-Schild and double Kerr-Schild forms. We extend several solutions from the theory of General Relativity, characterized by a constant Ricci scalar in single and double Kerr-Schild forms, to derive solutions in the multi-gravity context. We also examine and extend the classical double copy relations that can be constructed out from these solutions in multigravity exploring the dynamics of the single copy and zero copy fields.</description>

      <title>Design of low-energy transfers in cislunar space using sequences of lobe dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical structures in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) are fundamental for designing low-energy transfers, as they aid in analyzing phase space transport and designing desirable trajectories. This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to nonholonomic and inequality-constrained mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational principles play a central role in classical mechanics, providing compact formulations of dynamics and direct access to conserved quantities. While holonomic systems admit well-known action formulations, non-holonomic systems -- subject to non-integrable velocity constraints or position inequality constraints -- have long resisted a general extremized action treatment. In this work, we construct an explicit and general action for non-holonomic motion, motivated by the classical limit of the quantum Schwinger-Keldysh action formalism, rediscovered by Galley. Our formulation recovers the correct dynamics of the Lagrange-d'Alembert equations via extremization of a scalar action. We validate the approach on canonical examples using direct numerical optimization of the novel action, bypassing equations of motion. Our framework extends the reach of variational mechanics and offers new analytical and computational tools for constrained systems.</description>
