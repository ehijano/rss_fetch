      <title>From non-equilibrium Green functions to Lattice Wigner: A toy model for quantum nanofluidics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments of fluid transport in nano-channels have shown evidence of a dramatic reduction of friction due to the coupling between charge-fluctuations in polar fluids and electronic excitations in graphene solids, a phenomenon dubbed "negative quantum friction". In this paper, we present a semi-classical mesoscale Boltzmann-Wigner lattice kinetic model of quantum-nanoscale transport and perform a numerical study of the effects of the quantum interactions on the evolution of a one-dimensional nano-fluid subject to a periodic external potential. It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the wavelength of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are "protected" by thermal fluctuations. It is hoped that the present Boltzmann-Wigner lattice model and extensions thereof may offer a useful tool for the computer simulation of quantum-nanofluidic transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Topological Transitions, Pinning and Ratchets for Driven Magnetic Hopfions in Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using atomistic simulations, we examine the dynamics of three-dimensional magnetic hopfions interacting with an array of line defects or posts as a function of defect spacing, defect strength, and current. We find a pinned phase, a sliding phase where a hopfion can move through the posts or hurdles by distorting, and a regime where the hopfion becomes compressed and transforms into a toron that is half the size of the hopfion and moves at a lower velocity. The toron states occur when the defects are strong; however, in the toron regime, it is possible to stabilize sliding hopfions by increasing the applied current. Hopfions move without a Hall angle, while the toron moves with a finite Hall angle. We also show that when a hopfion interacts with an asymmetric array of planar defects, a ratchet effect consisting of a net dc motion can be realized under purely ac driving.</description>

      <title>Programmable Synthetic Magnetism and Chiral Edge States in Nano-Optomechanical Quantum Hall Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry in engineered materials--also known as metamaterials, enabling robust, topological transport of neutral excitations, much like electronic conduction edge channels in the integer quantum Hall effect. We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of quantum-Hall-like chiral edge states in optomechanical resonator networks. Synthetic magnetic fields for phononic excitations are induced through laser drives, while cavity optomechanical control allows full reconfigurability of the effective metamaterial response of the networks, including programming of magnetic fluxes in multiple resonator plaquettes. By tuning the interplay between network connectivity and magnetic fields, we demonstrate both flux-sensitive and flux-insensitive localized mechanical states. Scaling up the system creates spectral features that are precursors to Hofstadter butterfly spectra. Site-resolved spectroscopy reveals edge-bulk separation, with stationary phononic distributions signaling chiral edge modes. We directly probe those edge modes in transport measurements to demonstrate a unidirectional acoustic channel. This work unlocks new ways of controlling topological phononic phases at the nanoscale with applications in noise management and information processing.</description>

      <title>Effects of GaAs Buffer Layer on Structural, Magnetic, and Transport Properties of Magnetic Topological Insulators Cr$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$ and V$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$ Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we study the effects of a GaAs buffer layer on the structural, magnetic, and transport properties of Cr$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$ magnetic topological insulator thin films and compare them with those of V$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$, which we recently reported. Similar to the case of V$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$, growth on a GaAs buffer layer leads to some distinctly different properties than direct growth on InP substrates. These include improved interface quality confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, enhanced magnetic coercive fields, and smaller resistivity peaks at the magnetization reversals. Furthermore, the Bi-ratio dependence of the carrier density reveals that the interface property also affects the Fermi level. These results demonstrate the importance of the buffer layer in controlling the electronic properties of the magnetic topological insulator films.</description>

      <title>Magnetizing weak links by time-dependent spin-orbit interactions: momentum conserving and non-conserving processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit interactions generated by time-dependent electric fields acting on weak links (that couple together non-magnetic macroscopic leads) can magnetize the junction. The Rashba spin-orbit interaction that affects the spins of electrons tunneling through the weak links changes their momentum concomitantly. We establish the connection between the magnetization flux induced by processes that conserve the momentum and the magnetization created by tunneling events that do not. Control of the induced magnetization can be achieved by tuning the polarization of the AC electric field responsible for the spin-orbit Rashba interaction (e.g., from being circular to linear), by changing the applied bias voltage, and by varying the degree of a gate voltage-induced asymmetry of the device.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Picosecond-scale Octupole Fluctuations in Chiral Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory for the relaxation time of the octupole order parameter in nanoscale chiral antiferromagnets (AFMs) coupled to thermal baths and spin injection sources. Using stochastic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the octupole moment relaxes through two distinct mechanisms$-$escape over a barrier and precessional dephasing$-$as the barrier for octupole fluctuations is lowered relative to the thermal energy. Notably, the octupole moment relaxes orders of magnitude faster than the typical dipolar order parameters, reaching picosecond timescales. By combining Langer's theory with an effective low-energy description of octupole dynamics in chiral AFMs, we derive analytical expressions for the relaxation times. We find that relaxation in chiral AFMs parallels dipole relaxation in XY magnets, with exchange fields serving the role of the dipole fields. Further, by drawing on the analogy between order parameter dynamics in XY magnets under spin injection and current-biased Josephson junctions, we propose a new scheme for electrically tuning the octupole relaxation times. Our work offers fundamental insights for the development of next-generation spintronic devices that harness octupole order parameters for information encoding, especially in octupole-based probabilistic computing.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall magnetoresistance at the altermagnetic insulator/Pt interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resistance of a heavy metal can be modulated by an adjacent magnetic material through the combined effects of the spin Hall effect, inverse spin Hall effect, and dissipation of the spin accumulation at the interface. This phenomenon is known as spin Hall magnetoresistance. The dissipation of the spin accumulation can occur via various mechanisms, with spin-transfer torque being the most extensively studied. In this work, we report the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance at the interface between platinum and an insulating altermagnetic candidate, Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$. Our findings reveal that this heterostructure exhibits a relatively large spin Hall magnetoresistance signal, which is anisotropic with respect to the crystal orientation of the current channel. We explore and rule out several potential explanations for this anisotropy and propose that our results may be understood in the context of the anisotropic altermagnetic ordering of Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Molecular details and free energy barriers of ion de-coordination at elevated salinity and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion dehydration has been shown to strongly influence separation performance in membrane systems and ion transport in nanoscale channels. It is especially important for membrane-based brine treatment, which is limited by high pressures and concentrations. However, the molecular details and drivers of ion dehydration in membranes are not well understood, in particular under relevant conditions for membrane operation. In this study, we estimated the dehydration free energies for a range of different ions at high pressure and salinity relevant to brine treatment using molecular simulation. In order to more clearly interpret these results, we developed a procedure to unambiguously estimate these free energies as a function of discrete-valued coordination number. We also proposed alternatives to the coordination number as geometrical constraints for traversing nanoscale constrictions, such as the maximum cross-sectional area of the complexed ion, and calculated the free energy of dehydration as a function of these constraints. We show that high operating pressures do not significantly change cation hydration shell stability nor the shell size, while high ionic concentrations lower the free energy barrier to reduce the cation coordination number. High concentration introduces many ion pairing events, which contribute to the lower barrier. We find that anion dehydration free energies are largely unaffected by these conditions, only showing a small increase in free energy at high pressure. We propose strategies to improve ion-ion selectivity by leveraging the effects of elevated pressure and salinity on ion dehydration.</description>

      <title>Two-site Kitaev sweet spots evolving into topological islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains based on arrays of quantum dots are promising platforms for realizing Majorana Bound States (MBSs). In a two-site Kitaev chain, it is possible to find these non-Abelian zero-energy excitations at certain points in parameter space (sweet spots). These states, commonly referred to as Poor man's Majorana bound states (PMMs), are challenging to find and stabilize experimentally. In this work, we investigate the evolution of the sweet spots as we increase the number of sites of the Kitaev chain. To this end, we use the Bogoliubov-de Gennes representation to study the excitations of the system, and the scattering matrix and Green functions formalisms to calculate the zero-bias conductance. Our results show that the sweet spots evolve into a region that grows bigger and becomes gradually more protected as the number of sites $N$ increases. Due to the protection of the MBSs, we refer to this region as a topological island. We obtain similar results by considering a realistic spinful model with finite magnetic fields in a chain of normal-superconducting quantum dots. For long chains, $N \geq 20$, we show the emergence of strictly zero-energy plateaus robust against disorder. Finally, we demonstrate that the topological islands can be observed by performing conductance measurements via a quantum dot side-coupled to the Kitaev chain. Our work shows that the fine-tuning required to create and detect PMMs in a 2-site Kitaev chain is significantly relaxed as the length of the chain increases and details how PMMs evolve into MBSs. Our results are consistent with experimental reports for 2 and 3-site chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05175v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a machine-learning-based procedure to automate the charge tuning of semiconductor spin qubits with minimal human intervention, addressing one of the significant challenges in scaling up quantum dot technologies. This method exploits artificial neural networks to identify noisy transition lines in stability diagrams, guiding a robust exploration strategy leveraging neural networks' uncertainty estimations. Tested across three distinct offline experimental datasets representing different single quantum dot technologies, the approach achieves over 99% tuning success rate in optimal cases, where more than 10% of the success is directly attributable to uncertainty exploitation. The challenging constraints of small training sets containing high diagram-to-diagram variability allowed us to evaluate the capabilities and limits of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present recommendations for how to improve reproducibility in the field of condensed matter physics. This area of physics has consistently produced both fundamental insights into the functioning of matter as well as transformative inventions. Our recommendations result from a collaboration that includes researchers in academia and government laboratories, scientific journalists, legal professionals, representatives of publishers, professional societies, and other experts. The group met in person in May 2024 at a conference at the University of Pittsburgh to discuss the growing challenges related to research reproducibility in condensed matter physics. We discuss best practices and policies at all stages of the scientific process to safeguard the value condensed matter research brings to society. We look forward to comments and suggestions, especially regarding subfield-specific recommendations, and will incorporate them into the next version of the report.</description>

      <title>Unconventional high-temperature excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and analyze its superfluid properties. In particular, we estimate BKT temperatures between 75 K and 100 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate robust single-mode lasing in a non-Hermitian 1D trivial Su-Schrieffer-Heeger defective lattice. This structure exhibits a significantly lower threshold power compared to the non-defective lattice, with single-mode lasing sustained across a wide range of pump powers. Notably, our proposed device requires pumping of only the defect ring, leading to minimal required pump power. Moreover, lasing is not confined to the edges but can occur at any point within the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between intense light-matter not only promotes emerging applications in quantum and nonlinear optics but also facilitates changes in material properties. Plasmons can significantly enhance not only molecular chirality but also the coupling strength. In this study, we investigate the coupling dichroism in a strongly coupled chiral molecule-plasmonic nanoparticle system using RT-TDDFT. By simulating the interaction between L/D- Phenylglycinol molecules and chiral aluminum clusters (Na-doped Al197Na4), we examine the effects of molecular chirality, cluster chirality, and the coupled effect in the system. Our results demonstrate that the achiral/chiral clusters induce significant spectral shifts and enhance molecular CD signals due to strong plasmon-molecule coupling. The electric-field distribution and transition contribution maps (TCMs) reveal the formation of bonding and antibonding polaritonic modes, modulated by molecular proximity to the cluster. Both of the coupling factor and decay rate of the coupled system will be modulated by the chirality of the molecules and the cluster. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of coupled molecules leads to a substantial increase in the intensity of lower polaritonic modes, highlighting the collective behavior in multi-molecule systems due to the modal crosstalk or resonance between cluster chirality and molecular chirality. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing plasmon-enhanced chirality at the atomic scale, which have implications for the design of highly sensitive chiral sensors and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of dipolar molecules in SiO$_2$ hybrid organic inorganic films: use of silver nanoparticles as inhibitors of molecular aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technological implementation of hybrid organic-inorganic materials in second order nonlinear optical photonic devices depends strongly on the ability of the host matrixes to contain high loads of dipolar molecules without aggregation. Some organic molecules are often used to diminish the attracting interactions between dipolar molecules in such kind of materials, but their efficiency as inhibitors of molecular aggregation is limited by their polarizability. In this work, we report the use of silver nanoparticles as inhibitors of molecular aggregation in hybrid organic-inorganic films doped with dipolar molecules. The large polarizability of the silver nanoparticles makes them ideal moieties for the inhibition of the electrostatic interactions between dipolar nonlinear optical molecules. The average size of the silver nanoparticles in this work was 70.5 nm in diameter, they were synthesized using silver nitrate (AgNO$_3$) as precursor and aminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane as reducing agent. These nanoparticles were immersed in SiO$_2$ hybrid organic-inorganic sol-gel films doped with dipolar chromophores to study their effect as inhibitors of dipolar chromophores aggregation. The presence of the silver nanoparticles in the solid films was confirmed by transmission electronic microscopy and UV-Visible spectroscopy. UV-Visible spectroscopy was also used to monitor the dipolar chromophores aggregation in the SiO$_2$ films. We found that, at room temperature, silver nanoparticles are good inhibiting chromophores aggregation in comparison with the performance of organic inhibitors.</description>

      <title>The Influence of V-Defects, Leakage, and Random Alloy Fluctuations on the Carrier Transport in Red InGaN MQW LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage (\(V &lt; \hbar\omega/e = 2.0 \, \text{V}\)) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Membrane phononic crystals for high-Qm mechanical defect modes in piezoelectric aluminum nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with exceptionally low dissipation are advancing mechanics-based sensors and quantum technologies. The key for these advances is the engineering of localized phononic modes that are well-isolated from the environment, i.e., that exhibit a high mechanical quality factor, Qm. Membrane phononic crystals fabricated from strained thin films can realize high-Qm single or multiple localized phononic defect modes. These defect modes can be efficiently interfaced with out-of-plane light or capacitively coupled to a microwave quantum circuit, enabling readout and control of their motion. When membrane phononic crystals are fabricated from a crystalline film, they could offer built-in functionality. We demonstrate a membrane phononic crystal realized in a strained 90 nm-thin film of aluminum nitride (AlN), which is a crystalline piezoelectric material. We engineer a high-Qm localized phononic defect mode at 1.8 MHz with a Qxf-product of 1.5 10^13 Hz at room temperature. In future devices, the built-in piezoelectricity of AlN can be utilized for in-situ tuning of mechanical mode frequencies, defect mode couplings, or acoustic bandgaps, which can be used as building blocks of tunable phononic circuits.</description>

      <title>Fractons from covariant higher-rank 3D BF theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the 3D gauge theory of two tensor gauge fields: $a_{\mu\nu}(x)$, which we take symmetric, and $B_{\mu\nu}(x)$, with no symmetry on its indices. The corresponding invariant action is a higher-rank BF-like model, which is first considered from a purely field theoretical point of view, and the propagators with their poles and the degrees of freedom are studied. Once matter is introduced, a fracton behaviour naturally emerges. We show that our theory can be mapped to the low-energy effective field theory describing the Rank-2 Toric Code (R2TC). This relation between our covariant BF-like theory and the R2TC is a higher-rank generalization of the equivalence between the ordinary 3D BF theory and the Kitaev's Toric Code. In the last part of the paper we analyze the case in which the field $B_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is a symmetric tensor. It turns out that the obtained BF-like action can be cast into the sum of two rank-2 Chern-Simons actions, thus generalizing the ordinary abelian case. Therefore, this represents a higher-rank generalization of the ordinary 3D BF theory, which well describes the low-energy physics of quantum spin Hall insulators in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquids in noise magnetormetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of isolated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is a key step towards the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Here we show how the $T_1$-based noise magnetormetry of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit can reveal the unique signatures of Majorana fermions attached to vacancies in a non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL). The $1/T_1$ of the NV center is found to be increased significantly when the working frequency of the NV center matches the energy difference between a MZM and a low-energy hybridized mode involving dangling Majorana fermions adjacent to vacancies. In experiments, this energy difference can be tuned by an external Zeeman field. Because of the large excitation gap of flipping a local $Z_2$ gauge field, the $1/T_1$ spectrum is robust against other fluctuations in KQSLs. Our study presents a promising pathway for identifying the non-Abelian phase in Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>A Metal-Insulator Transition of the Buried MnO2 Monolayer in Complex Oxide Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functionalities in crystalline materials are determined by 3-dimensional collective interactions of atoms. The confinement of dimensionality in condensed matter provides an exotic research direction to understand the interaction of atoms, thus can be used to tailor or create new functionalities in material systems. In this study, a 2-dimensional transition metal oxide monolayer is constructed inside complex oxide heterostructures based on the theoretical predictions. The electrostatic boundary conditions of oxide monolayer in the heterostructure is carefully designed to tune the chemical, electronic, and magnetic states of oxide monolayer. The challenge of characterizing such an oxide monolayer is overcome by a combination of transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy, and electrical transport measurements. An intriguing metal-insulator transition associated with a magnetic transition is discovered in the MnO2 monolayer. This study paves a new route to understand the confinement of dimensionality and explore new intriguing phenomena in condensed matters.</description>

      <title>Addressing the correlation of Stokes-shifted photons emitted from two quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In resonance fluorescence excitation experiments, light emitted from solid-state quantum emitters is typically filtered to eliminate the laser photons, ensuring that only red-shifted Stokes photons are detected. Theoretical analyses of the fluorescence intensity correlation often model emitters as two-level systems, focusing on light emitted exclusively from the purely electronic transition (the Zero-Phonon Line), or rely on statistical approaches based on conditional probabilities that do not account for quantum coherences. Here, we propose a general model to characterize the correlation of either Zero-Phonon Line photons or Stokes-shifted photons. This model successfully reproduces the experimental correlation of Stokes-shifted photons emitted from two interacting molecules and predicts that this correlation is affected by quantum coherence. Besides, we analyze the role of quantum coherence in light emission from two uncorrelated emitters, which helps to clarify the discrepancy between theory and experiments regarding the value of the correlation of photons emitted from this system at zero delay time.</description>

      <title>Tunable Fractional Chern Insulators in Rhombohedral Graphene Superlattices</title>

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) showing a transport effect with fractionally quantized Hall plateaus emerging under zero magnetic field, provide a radically new opportunity to engineer topological quantum electronics. By construction of topological flat band with moire engineering, intrinsic FCIs have been observed in twisted MoTe2 system and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/hBN moire superlattices with anomalous Hall resistivity quantization number C &lt;= 2/3 including the gapless composite Fermi-liquid state with C = 1/2. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new system of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG)/hBN moire superlattices, which exhibit both integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects with rich tunability including electric displacement field, perpendicular magnetic field and in-plane magnetic field. By tuning the electrical and magnetic fields at 0 &lt; v &lt; 1, we have observed a quantum phase transition showing a sign reversal of the Hall resistivity at finite magnetic fields. Surprisingly, the FCI state at v = 2/3 survives in the phase transitions, exhibiting a robust quantized Hall resistivity across both phases. Finally we have further demonstrated the indispensable role moire potential plays in the formation of the flat Chern band from a theoretical perspective. Our work has established RHG/hBN moire superlattices as a promising platform for exploring quasi-particles with fractional charge and non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: In transmission electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the cross section in 2D is quenched by kinematic effects once the momentum transfer becomes smaller than a critical value set by $q_z$, the momentum loss parallel to the beam. Our highly momentum ($\Delta q = 0.02$~\r{A}$^{-1}$) and energy ($\Delta E = 45$~meV) resolved setup is instrumental on delivering the unprecedented experimental verification of quenched 2D EEL spectra on freestanding graphene at momentum transfers $q$ below $0.06$\r{A}$^{-1}$. We retrieve the intrinsic uniform dielectric response of graphene from measured spectra by quantifying the kinematic suppression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice deformations in graphene couple to the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom as effective scalar and gauge fields. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the optical component of the displacement field, i.e., the relative motion of different sublattices, contributes at equal order as the acoustic component and effectively screens the pseudogauge fields. In particular, we consider twisted bilayer graphene and corrugated monolayer graphene. In both cases, optical lattice displacements significantly reduce the overall magnitude of the pseudomagnetic fields. For corrugated graphene, optical contributions also reshape the pseudomagnetic field and significantly modify the electronic bands near charge neutrality. Previous studies based on continuum elasticity, which ignores this effect, have therefore systematically overestimated the strength of the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field. Our results have important consequences for the interpretation of experiments and design of straintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schr\"odinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</description>

Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials that challenge the conventional wisdom of transport. The intrinsically strong electronic correlations combined with the vanishing kinetic energy scale suggest a sensitive dependence of transport properties on the flat band states and make interacting flat bands promising candidates for exotic quantum transport. Utilizing the Drude weight, we investigate the low-frequency spectral properties of the electrical conductivity within a controlled analytic treatment of the many-body response at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap. Focusing on this new transport regime, we demonstrate the potential of a quantum geometric approach for interacting systems and intermediate temperatures. The derived spectral weight yields unexplored four-point geometric contributions unrelated to the quantum metric, which questions the previously proposed projection methods. For long-ranged interactions, we show that the low-frequency spectral weight reduces to the variance of the Berry curvature.</description>

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) with fractionally quantized Hall conductance at fractional fillings and an extended quantum anomalous Hall (EQAH) crystal with an integer quantized Hall conductance over an extended region of doping were recently observed in pentalayer graphene. One particularly puzzling observation is the transition between the EQAH and FCI regimes, driven either by temperature or electrical current. Here we propose a scenario to understand these transitions based on the topologically protected gapless edge modes that are present in both the FCI and EQAH phases and should be most relevant at temperature scales below the energy gap. Our consideration is based on the simple assumption that the edge velocity in FCI is smaller than that in EQAHE and thus contributes to a higher entropy. We further argue that domains with opposite fractionally quantized Hall conductance are ubiquitous in the devices due to disorder, which gives rise to a network of edge modes. The velocity of the edge modes between domains is further reduced due to edge reconstruction. The edge velocity can also be reduced by current when the occupation of the edge mode approaches the gap edge. The edge entropy therefore drives the transition from EQAH to FCI either by temperature or current at a nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01913</link>

Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity Magnetism Driven by Antiferromagnetic Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</description>
