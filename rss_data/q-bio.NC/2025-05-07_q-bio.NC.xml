      <title>An Active Inference perspective on Neurofeedback Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurofeedback training (NFT) aims to teach self-regulation of brain activity through real-time feedback, but suffers from highly variable outcomes and poorly understood mechanisms, hampering its validation. To address these issues, we propose a formal computational model of the NFT closed loop. Using Active Inference, a Bayesian framework modelling perception, action, and learning, we simulate agents interacting with an NFT environment. This enables us to test the impact of design choices (e.g., feedback quality, biomarker validity) and subject factors (e.g., prior beliefs) on training. Simulations show that training effectiveness is sensitive to feedback noise or bias, and to prior beliefs (highlighting the importance of guiding instructions), but also reveal that perfect feedback is insufficient to guarantee high performance. This approach provides a tool for assessing and predicting NFT variability, interpret empirical data, and potentially develop personalized training protocols.</description>

      <title>The insertion of Neomycin cassette impairs maternal and social behaviors in Arc/Arg3.1 knock-out mice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neomycin resistance cassette (Neo+) is commonly inserted in the genome of mice to generate knock-out (KO) models. The effect of gene deletion on social behaviors in mice is controversial between studies using different Neo+ and Neo-mouse lines, particularly Arc/Arg3.1 KO lines. In this study, we identified severe maternal behavior impairments in Neo+, but not Neo-Arc/Arg3.1 KO dams. These deficits resulted from reduced sociability and abnormal social information processing in Neo+ Arc/Arg3.1 KO dams, exacerbated by social communication impairments in pups. The expression of the Neo cassette product did not cause cytotoxicity, but led to altered ERK signaling, gene expression, and oxytocin system. However, oxytocin administration did not improve social impairments in Neo+ Arc/Arg3.1 KO animals. Interestingly, early social environment enrichment enhanced social interaction with familiar, but not unfamiliar conspecifics or maternal behavior. Overall, our findings reveal a major impact of the Neo cassette on behaviors, particularly social behaviors, in Arc/Arg3.1 KO mice, underscoring the need to re-examine phenotypes of animal models carrying the Neo cassette in neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>The classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment improved by dynamic functional network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain network analysis using functional MRI has advanced our understanding of cortical activity and its changes in neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia. Recently, research in brain connectivity has focused on dynamic (time-varying) brain networks that capture both spatial and temporal information on cortical, regional co-activity patterns. However, this approach has been largely unexplored within the Alzheimer's spectrum. We analysed age- and sex-matched static and dynamic fMRI brain networks from 315 individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitively-normal Healthy Elderly (HE), using data from the ADNI-3 protocol. We examined both similarities and differences between these groups, employing the Juelich brain atlas for network nodes, sliding-window correlations for time-varying network links, and non-parametric statistics to assess between-group differences at the link or the node centrality level. While the HE and MCI groups show similar static and dynamic networks at the link level, significant differences emerge compared to AD participants. We found stable (stationary) differences in patterns of functional connections between the white matter regions and the parietal lobe's, and somatosensory cortices, while metastable (temporal) networks' differences were consistently found between the amygdala and hippocampal formation. In addition, our node centrality analysis showed that the white matter connectivity patterns are local in nature. Our results highlight shared and unique functional connectivity patterns in both stationary and dynamic functional networks, emphasising the need to include dynamic information in brain network analysis in studies of Alzheimer's spectrum.</description>

      <title>Binding threshold units with artificial oscillatory neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons were recently introduced as an alternative to threshold units. Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory units outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object discovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for these oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto equation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this research note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes oscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism between them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and threshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold units model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate information exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between these two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical systems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to Hopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a specific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems can be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model, which also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible. Notably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction to the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed either as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for fine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization of this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments.</description>

      <title>Predictive processing frameworks for perception can explain recent drone sightings in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We draw on the predictive processing theory of perception to explain why healthy, intelligent, honest, and psychologically normal people might easily misperceive lights in the sky as threatening or extraordinary objects, especially in the context of WEIRD (western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic) societies. We argue that the uniquely sparse properties of skyborne and celestial stimuli make it difficult for an observer to update prior beliefs, which can be easily fit to observed lights. Moreover, we hypothesize that humans have likely evolved to perceive the sky and its perceived contents as deeply meaningful. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible role of generalized distrust in scientific institutions and ultimately argue for the importance of astronomy education for producing a society with prior beliefs that support veridical perception.</description>

      <title>Hyperchaos and complex dynamical regimes in $N$-dimensional neuron lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the ``destructive interference'' of many connected neurons and miniature ``phase transitions'' from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.</description>

      <title>Are Colors Quanta of Light for Human Vision? A Quantum Cognition Study of Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that colors are light quanta for human visual perception in a similar way as photons are light quanta for physical measurements of light waves. Our result relies on the identification in the quantum measurement process itself of the warping mechanism which is characteristic of human perception. This warping mechanism makes stimuli classified into the same category perceived as more similar, while stimuli classified into different m categories are perceived as more different. In the quantum measurement process, the warping takes place between the pure states, which play the role played for human perception by the stimuli, and the density states after decoherence, which play the role played for human perception by the percepts. We use the natural metric for pure states, namely the normalized Fubini Study metric to measure distances between pure states, and the natural metric for density states, namely the normalized trace-class metric, to measure distances between density states. We then show that when pure states lie within a well-defined region surrounding an eigenstate, the quantum measurement, namely the process of decoherence, contracts the distance between these pure states, while the reverse happens for pure states lying in a well-defined region between two eigenstates, for which the quantum measurement causes a dilation. We elaborate as an example the situation of a two-dimensional quantum measurement described by the Bloch model and apply it to the situation of two colors 'Light' and 'Dark'. We argue that this analogy of warping, on the one hand in human perception and on the other hand in the quantum measurement process, makes colors to be quanta of light for human vision.</description>
