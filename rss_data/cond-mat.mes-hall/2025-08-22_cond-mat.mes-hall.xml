      <title>Superdielectrics: Disorder-induced perfect screening in insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the quantities that encode the insulating properties of matter: the ground-state quantum metric, the average localization length, and the electric susceptibility. By examining the one-dimensional Anderson insulator model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with chiral disorder, we demonstrate that the former two measures are proportional in one-dimensional systems near criticality, and both are determined by the properties of the hybridized localized states around the Fermi energy. We employ these insights to demonstrate that the behavior of the electric susceptibility is drastically different in the bond-disordered SSH chain, with the possibility that it may diverge even when the localization length and the quantum metric remain finite. This divergence, caused by the proliferation of impurity resonances at a particular energy, leads to a novel regime that exhibits mixed characteristics of metals and insulators. We term this regime superdielectric: an insulating state characterized by a finite quantum metric and divergent static electric susceptibility, which implies perfect screening in the absence of the dc conductivity. We demonstrate that the superdielectric phase also emerges in higher-dimensional materials, such as graphene with vacancies and Kekul\'e bond distortion.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Seebeck ratio as a tool for elementary charge determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relationship between the Seebeck coefficient $(S)$, and the differential entropy per particle (DEP, $s$), as a tool for characterizing charge carriers in two-dimensional systems. Using armchair silicene nanoribbons as a model platform, we analyze how both quantities and their ratio depend on chemical potential at room temperature. While the Seebeck coefficient captures transport properties through the energy dependence of the electronic transmission, the DEP is directly connected to the system's electronic entropy, offering a direct thermodynamic alternative for estimating $S$. We evaluate these transport-thermodynamic properties considering diverse ribbon widths, defining metallic and semiconducting regimes. We find both quantities $S$ and $s$, are highly interconnected within the ribbon's band gap energy region, and their ratio $s/S$ converges to the elementary charge $e$ across that energy window, fulfilling the Kelvin formula $S=s/e$. On the contrary, $s/S$ is undefined for gapless ribbons in the energy window of the first transmission channel. These results establish the ratio between the DEP and the Seebeck coefficient as a reliable and complementary probe for the determination of the elementary charge, and to identify the cleanness of electronic band gaps as $s/S$ matches with $e$.</description>

      <title>Bending nanoribbon to induce large anisotropic magnetoconductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a nanoribbon is bent under a homogeneous external magnetic field, the effective magnetic field inside becomes either homogeneous or inhomogeneous, depending on the direction of the field. This enables the selective creation of bulk, interface, and edge magnetic states in the bent structure, for a magnetic field with a strength. We establish theoretically that these tuneable states lead to a strong geometry-induced anisotropic magnetoconductance (GAMC) in perpendicularly bent nanoribbon, which can reach up to 100\%. Moreover, the GAMC can be further enhanced to 200\%, 300\%, or even higher by either further bending or tuning the bending angle. The potential of this phenomenon for practical applications is demonstrated by its stable anisotropy, which remains consistent across a wide range of Fermi energies, can be observed even at weak magnetic fields and room temperature, and occurs in various systems such as two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and graphene.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Renormalization of the Hall Coefficient and Unconventional Hall Resistivity in ZrTe5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), conventionally associated with time-reversal symmetry breaking in ferromagnetic materials, has recently been observed in nonmagnetic topological materials, raising questions about its origin. We unravel the unconventional Hall response in the nonmagnetic Dirac material ZrTe5, known for its massive Dirac bands and unique electronic and transport properties. Using the Kubo-Streda formula within the Landau level framework, we explore the interplay of quantum effects induced by the magnetic field (B) and disorder across the semiclassical and quantum regimes. In the semiclassical regime, the Hall resistivity remains linear in the magnetic field, but the Hall coefficient will be renormalized by the quantum geometric effects and electron-hole coherence, especially at low carrier densities where the disorder scattering dominates. In quantum limit, the Hall conductivity exhibits an unsaturating 1/B scaling. As a result, the transverse conductivity dominates transport in the ultra-quantum limit, and the Hall resistivity crosses over from B to B^{-1} dependence as the system transitions from the semiclassical regime to the quantum limit. This work elucidates the mechanisms underlying the unconventional Hall effect in ZrTe5 and provides insights into the AHE in other nonmagnetic Dirac materials as well.</description>

      <title>Rotating Spin Wave Modes in Nanoscale M\"obius Strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved and topologically nontrivial magnetic structures offer new pathways to control spin-wave behavior beyond planar geometries. Here, we study spin-wave dynamics in M\"obius-shaped soft-magnetic nanostrips using micromagnetic simulations. By comparing single-, double-, and triple-twisted M\"obius strips to a topologically trivial bent ring, we isolate the roles of helical twist and non-orientable topology. M\"obius geometries exhibit non-degenerate mode doublets associated with counterpropagating spin waves, in contrast to the standing-wave doublets in the trivial case. This splitting arises from a twist-induced geometric (Berry) phase that breaks propagation symmetry, producing non-reciprocal dispersion relations. The M\"obius topology further imposes antisymmetric boundary conditions, resulting in half-integer wavelength quantization. Local RF excitation allows for the selective generation of spin waves with defined frequency and direction. An analytical model reproduces the dispersion behavior with excellent agreement. These results highlight how geometric and topological design can be leveraged to engineer spin-wave transport in three-dimensional magnonic systems.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly electrical readout of individual skyrmion dynamics by anomalous Hall effect, correlated with real-time Kerr microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized spin textures, are promising candidates for future memory devices and non-conventional computing applications due to their enhanced stability, non-linear interactions, and low-power manipulation capabilities. Despite their significant potential, the reliable electrical readout of individual skyrmions remains a fundamental challenge. While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous-Hall-effect-based techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications. Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos. These advances establish a robust platform for skyrmion-based sensors, counters and unconventional computing systems that depend on precise individual skyrmion control and detection.</description>

      <title>Optimizing energy conversion with nonthermal resources in steady-state quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a framework for optimizing energy conversion processes in coherent quantum conductors fed by nonthermal resources. Such nonthermal resources, which cannot be characterized by temperatures or electrochemical potentials, occur in small-scale systems that are smaller than their thermalization length. Using scattering theory in combination with a Lagrange multiplier method, we optimize the device's performance based on the efficiency, precision, or a trade-off between the two at a given output current. The transmission properties leading to this optimal performance are identified. We showcase our findings with the example of a refrigerator exploiting experimentally relevant nonthermal resources, which could result from competing environments or from light irradiation. We show that the performance is improved compared to a device exploiting a thermal resource. Our results can serve as guidelines for the design of energy-conversion processes in future nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of spin wave modes in individual cylindrical nanowires, a textbook situation of confined spin waves in 3D nanomagnetism. We observe discrete modes of thermal spin waves with micro-Brillouin light scattering, whose frequencies $f$ shift to higher values as the applied longitudinal induction magnetic field $B_z$ increases. Micromagnetic simulations allowed us to associate every $f(B_z)$ curve to a given spatial mode, labeled with radial and azimuthal indices $\ell$ and $m$.</description>

      <title>Second Harmonic Generation by Multilayer Graphenes and its Dependence on Stacking Order and Encapsulation Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the effects of external influences on the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal produced by multilayer graphenes. Specifically, we vary the encapsulation conditions and doping of graphenes, seeking to identify SHG "fingerprints" that are unsensitive to external perturbations. We identify characteristic features in the infrared regime that may be used as a stacking-order fingerprint for the mixed stacking tetralayer and the trilayer polytypes caused by a strong double resonance effect. Further to this, we find that the tetralayers systematically produce an SHG response that is significantly larger as compared to the trilayers. We then studied the SHG signal by the tetralayer polytypes in the terahertz regime and demonstrated the signal is highly sensitive the environmental conditions. Furthermore, we also find that accidental doping of graphene will strongly suppress the SHG signal in this regime. The above findings emphasize the need for a spectral approach to the identification of stacking order by SHG. Thus, measurements at one frequency are insufficient to confidently identify the stacking order due to the environmental sensitivities, since SHG can be readily induced with a comparable magnitude in the centrosymmetric polytypes through external symmetry-breaking.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Analysis of Charge Stability Diagrams with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models and end-to-end learning frameworks are rapidly revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. In this work, we apply object detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in semiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with spin-based quantum computing. Specifically, our model identifies triple points and their connectivity, which is crucial for virtual gate calibration, charge state initialization, drift correction, and pulse sequencing. We show that it surpasses convolutional neural networks in performance on three different spin qubit architectures, all without the need for retraining. In contrast to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces complexity and runtime, while enhancing generalizability. The results highlight the potential of transformer-based end-to-end learning frameworks as a foundation for a scalable, device- and architecture-agnostic tool for control and tuning of quantum dot devices.</description>

      <title>Orientation dependent anomalous Hall and spin Hall currents at the junctions of altermagnets with $p$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport across a junction between an altermagnet (AM) and a $p$-wave magnet (PM) using a continuum model with boundary conditions tailored to the spin-split band structures of the two materials. Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between the N\'eel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles, the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones. The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge conductivity may cancel for certain orientations, the transverse spin conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$ channels. These findings highlight altermagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions as a promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Lattice Order Controlled by Confinement Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions forming two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a versatile platform for investigating phase transitions predicted by Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory. While 2D melting in skyrmion systems has been demonstrated, achieving controlled ordering in skyrmion lattices remains challenging due to pinning effects from a non-uniform energy landscape, which often results in polycrystalline structures. Skyrmions in thin films, however, offer thermal diffusion with high tunability and can be directly imaged via Kerr microscopy, enabling real-time observation of their dynamics. To regulate lattice order in such flexible systems, we introduce geometric confinements of varying shapes. Combining Kerr microscopy experiments with Thiele model simulations, we demonstrate that confinement geometry critically influences lattice order. Specifically, hexagonal confinements commensurate with the skyrmion lattice stabilize monodomain hexagonal ordering, while incommensurate geometries induce domain formation and reduce overall order. Understanding these boundary-driven effects is essential for advancing the study of 2D phase behavior and for the design of skyrmion-based spintronic applications, ranging from memory devices to unconventional computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of dilute anyon gases from fusion constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements on 2d materials tuning between fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases and a plethora of correlated electronic states call for a detailed understanding of the dynamics of anyons. Here we develop a general theory of the statistical mechanics of anyon gases at finite temperature, valid in regimes where the anyons are sufficiently dilute and can be treated as weakly interacting particles. We find that with a minimal set of universal braiding and fusion data, along with information about the hierarchy of anyon gaps, it is possible to construct a distribution function for any dilute anyon gas, as well as derive thermodynamic observables. Our results are built on an anyon exclusion principle manifesting as a constraint on fusion outcomes of physical states. Our approach unifies and streamlines a range of results for itinerant anyon models, from solvable lattice Hamiltonians to large-N field theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum-size effect induced Andreev bound states in ultrathin metallic islands proximitized by a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Andreev bound states (ABSs) have been realized in engineered superconducting junctions, their direct observation in normal metal/superconductor heterostructures-enabled by quantum confinement-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we report the detection of ABSs in ultrathin metallic islands (Bi, Ag, and SnTe) grown on the s-wave superconductor NbN. Using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we clearly reveal in-gap ABSs with energies symmetric about the Fermi level. While the energies of these states show no position dependence, their wave functions exhibit spatial oscillations, demonstrating a quantum size effect. Both the energy levels and spatial distribution of the ABSs can be reproduced by our effective model in which a metallic island is coupled to the superconducting substrate via the proximity effect. We demonstrate that the coupling strength plays a critical role in determining the ABS energies. Our work introduces a novel physical platform for implementing ABSs, which hold promise for significant device applications.</description>

Abstract: Deterministically tailoring optical Fock states beyond the single-photon level is crucial for boson sampling, loss-tolerant photonic qubits, and quantum-enhanced sensing, however has yet remained elusive. Here, we report an all-linear-optical protocol that converts a resonantly driven single-photon emitter into a deterministic generator of vacuum--single-photon--two-photon states. A phase-stabilized, path-unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer combines vacuum--single-photon interference and Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, providing two knobs to shape photon-number probabilities. By tuning these knobs, we observe a dynamic transition from antibunching to strong bunching in correlation measurements. A fully quantum-mechanical, discrete time-bin model maps these results onto the tailored photon statistics. The same framework predicts that two indistinguishable emitters would extend the accessible space to deterministic NOON states and single-photon filtering. This protocol relying on linear optics and available single-photon sources provides a scalable, chip-compatible, and platform-independent route to on-demand and deterministic few-photon resources for quantum metrology, photonic computing, as well as long-distance quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Atomically thin silver films for enhanced nanoscale nonlinear optics</title>

Abstract: The inherently weak nonlinear optical response of bulk materials remains a fundamental limitation in advancing photonic technologies. Nanophotonics addresses this challenge by tailoring the size and morphology of nanostructures to manipulate the optical near field, thus modulating the nonlinear response. Here, we explore a complementary strategy based on engineering the electronic band structure in the mesoscopic regime to enhance optical nonlinearities. Specifically, we demonstrate an increase in second-harmonic generation (SHG) from crystalline silver films as their thickness is reduced down to just a few atomic monolayers. Operating at the boundary between bulk and two-dimensional systems, these ultra-thin films exhibit a pronounced enhancement of SHG with decreasing thickness. This enhancement stems from quantum confinement effects that modify the interaction between electronic states and incident light, which we explain based on quantum-mechanical calculation. Our atomically-thin crystalline silver films provide a new means to overcome the small interaction volumes inherent to nanophotonic platforms, enabling efficient nanoscale nonlinear optics with potential applications in photonics, sensing, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous nonreciprocal transport in a gate-tunable ferromagnetic Rashba 2-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broken inversion symmetry at interfaces of complex oxides gives rise to emergent phenomena, including ferromagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which profoundly influence the electronic structure by entangling spin and momentum. While the interplay between Rashba SOC and ferromagnetism is theoretically intriguing, its experimental manifestations remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic 2DEGs at SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces exhibit spontaneous nonreciprocal transport - a distinctive hallmark of Rashba ferromagnets - even in the absence of an external magnetic field. This nonreciprocal response, along with clear signatures of ferromagnetism such as anisotropic magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), is strongly tunable by gate voltage. Remarkably, the AHE not only varies in amplitude but even reverses sign, reflecting a subtle interplay between Fermi level position and Berry curvature distribution. These results establish SrTiO$_3$ 2DEGs as a model platform for studying Rashba ferromagnetism and demonstrate active control over transport phenomena in time- and inversion-symmetry-broken systems, paving the way for gate-tunable spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Control of Resistance Switching Transitions in First-Order Memristors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many cases, the behavior of physical memristive devices can be relatively well captured by using a single internal state variable. This study investigates the low-power control of first-order memristive devices to derive the most energy-efficient protocols for programming their resistances. A unique yet general approach to optimizing the switching transitions in devices of this kind is introduced. For pedagogical purposes, without loss of generality, the proposed control paradigm is applied to a couple of differential algebraic equation sets for voltage-controlled devices, specifically Kvatinsky's Voltage ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor mathematical description and Miranda's and Sune's dynamic balance model. It is demonstrated that, depending upon intrinsic physical properties of the device, captured in the model formulas and parameter setting, and upon constraints on programming time and voltages, the optimal protocol for either of the two switching scenarios may require the application of a single square voltage pulse of height set to a certain level within the admissible range across a fraction or entire given programming time interval, or of some more involved voltage stimulus of unique polarity, including analogue continuous waveforms that can be approximated by trains of square voltage pulses of different heights, over the entire programming time interval. The practical implications of these research findings are significant, as the development of energy-efficient protocols to program memristive devices, resolving the so-called voltage-time dilemma in the device physics community, is a subject under intensive and extensive studies across the academic community and industry.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from the environment. At the same time, a finite degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Therefore, detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. While various platforms enabled single-shot readout of nuclear spins, their direct environments were either unknown or impossible to controllably modify on the atomic scale. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual $^{\text{49}}$Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its lifetime to be in the order of seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on the pumping and relaxation mechanisms of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and tunnelling current, which is supported by model calculations. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically assembled qubit platforms.</description>

Abstract: We define the absolute Wilson loop winding and prove that it bounds the (integrated) quantum metric from below. This Wilson loop lower bound naturally reproduces the known Chern and Euler bounds of the integrated quantum metric and provides an explicit lower bound of the integrated quantum metric due to the time-reversal protected $Z_2$ index, answering a hitherto open question. In general, the Wilson loop lower bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole $Z_2$ index. As physical consequences of the $Z_2$ bound, we show that the time-reversal $Z_2$ index bounds superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below and bounds the direct gap of a band insulator from above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying material properties and ultra-fast electron dynamics, where its coherent character is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we uncover a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs. inter-band contributions. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space in gapped systems with both linear dispersion, such as for massive Dirac Fermions, and with quadratic dispersion, as e.g. for bilayer graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that, upon increasing dephasing, destructive interference between intra- and inter-band contributions is lifted. This leads to reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics, i.e. a crossover from the characteristic spectral "shoulder" to a slowly decaying signal involving much higher harmonics.</description>

      <title>Negative currents in Fabry-P\'erot cavities are caused by interfering paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been predicted that the time-dependent current in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity can turn negative even if the applied voltage pulses are always positive. It has also been suggested that the negative currents are related to interfering paths, however, an analytic description of this surprising phenomenon has so far been missing. Here we make use of Floquet scattering theory to demonstrate that the negative currents indeed are caused by the interference of scattering paths through the cavity with different numbers of roundtrips. Our analytic result can be tested in future experiments as it predicts exactly how the effect should be washed out by an increasing temperature. We show that a similar phenomenon is expected for the heat current, which may also turn negative.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Energy Dissipation in Non-Contact Single-Molecule Junctions Governed by Local Geometry and Electronic Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vibrational dynamics of adsorbate molecules in single-molecule junctions depend critically on the geometric structure and electronic interactions between molecule and substrate. Vibrations, excited mechanochemically or by external stimuli, dissipate energy into substrate electrons and phonons. Energy dissipation leads to the broadening of spectral lines, vibrational lifetimes, and the coupling between molecular and substrate phonons. It affects molecular manipulation, giving rise to nanoscale friction, and contributes to scanning probe and surface spectroscopy signals. We present an approach to disentangle adsorbate vibrational dynamics in non-contact junctions by employing density functional theory, machine learning, and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. Focusing on the CO-functionalised Cu surfaces representing a single-molecule junction, a widely studied system in scanning probe and energy dissipation experiments, we reveal strong vibrational mode specificity governed by the interplay of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling. Electron-phonon relaxation rates vary by two orders of magnitude between modes and sensitively depend on the tip-substrate geometry. We find evidence of a weak non-additive effect between both energy dissipation channels, where electron-phonon coupling enhances phonon-phonon coupling. Our predicted vibrational lifetimes agree with infrared spectroscopy and helium scattering experiments. Finally, we outline how our findings can inform and enhance scanning probe experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an analytical theoretical model for non-linear hydrodynamic magnetotransport of two-dimensional (2D) electron fluid with strong pair correlations in the electron dynamics. Within classical kinetics of 2D electrons, such correlations are described as subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons, temporarily joined in pairs. Corresponding correlation-induced retarded terms in the fluid dynamic equations can be described for slow flows as the dependence of the electron fluid viscosity on the flow velocity gradient, that is Non-Newtonian behavior of the fluid. We analytically calculate flow profiles in long samples in a stationary highly non-linear regime and the corresponding magnetoresistance. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic non-monotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on non-linear magnetotransport of high-purity GaAs quantum wells; we conclude that our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance.</description>

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is emerging as a powerful tool for imaging magnetic and electric signals at the microscale and below. However, most imaging demonstrations thus far have relied on costly, millimeter-sized bulk diamond substrates, which cannot be easily scaled or integrated with other materials. Here, we report a scalable method for fabricating NV-containing dense and homogenous fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) layers through electrostatic self-assembly and demonstrate the utility of the FND layers for magnetic imaging. We investigate the effect of FND concentration in suspension, substrate immersion time, and solvent pH on the FND density on the substrate. We identify optimized self-assembly conditions that maximize the FND density while minimizing aggregation. Using FND layers on a quartz substrate, we demonstrate magnetic field and magnetic noise imaging at the microscale, based on NV optically detected magnetic resonance magnetometry and T$_1$ relaxometry, respectively. Our results provide a direction for the development of cost-effective and scalable FND layers and surface coatings. This paves the way for on-demand quantum sensing and imaging on a broad range of surfaces based on NV centers and other diamond quantum emitters.</description>

Abstract: Topological phases characterized by non-Abelian charges have garnered increasing attention recently. Although Floquet (periodic-driving) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in non-Abelian topological insulators with multiple entangled energy gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we extend previous research by investigating higher-order topological phases featuring non-Abelian charges through Floquet engineering. Here we construct a model for two-dimensional non-Abelian higher-order topological phases on a square lattice subjected to two-step periodic driving. We find that the corner and edge states emerge and appear in all energy gaps despite the quaternion charge being trivial. Moreover, spatially exchanging the driving generates exotic interface modes-a hallmark of non-Abelian dynamics, namely non-commutativity. Notably, the non-zero composite Chern number demonstrates the non-triviality of the Floquet non-Abelian system with. We further reveal that the configuration of these quaternion-charge edge states is entirely determined by the quadruple degenerate phase-band singularities in the time evolution. Our work provides a platform for studying higher-order topological states and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum confinement of surface electrons in two-dimensional metal-organic porous networks offers a powerful route to engineer electronic states for emerging quantum and spintronic technologies at the molecular scale. To date, such confinement has been understood primarily in terms of lateral, two-dimensional surface potential landscapes. Here, we demonstrate the pivotal role of vertical variations in the surface potential on the quantum confinement of surface electrons. We investigate the confinement behavior of both Shockley surface state and image potential state electrons with their distinct vertical electron density distributions in an exemplary Cu-T4PT metal-organic porous network on Cu(111). Advanced spectroscopic techniques reveal a substantial band renormalization for the image state electrons, manifested as a significant increase in their effective mass, whereas the Shockley state electrons remain almost unchanged. Such striking divergence is attributed to the distinct three-dimensional potential landscape of the Cu-T4PT network with a strong repulsive potential at the vertical position of the molecular backbone and leaky channels underneath the Cu coordination spheres. Our findings demonstrate the essential role of vertical potential engineering in designing quantum confined states and thus advance the control of electronic properties and quantum phenomena on the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a natural identification of cobordism classes of framed links with the fundamental group of the group-completed configuration space of points in the plane, by appeal to Okuyama's previously underappreciated interval configuration model for the latter. Under Segal's theorem, these classes are integers generated by the Hopf generator in the 2-cohomotopy of the 3-sphere, and we identify these knot-theoretically with the writhe sum of the linking and framing number of links. We observe that this link invariant is the properly regularized Wilson line observable of abelian Chern-Simons theory, and show, in consequence of the main theorem, that this arises equivalently as the expectation value of pure quantum states on the group algebra, under link sum, of cobordism classes of framed links. Observing that these quantum states regard framed links as worldlines of anyons in that they assign a fixed complex phase factor to each crossing (braiding) of strands, we close with an outlook on implications for the identification of anyonic solitons in 2D electron gases as exotic flux quantized in Cohomotopy instead of in ordinary cohomology.</description>

Abstract: The Wilczek-Zee (WZ) holonomy arises in degenerate states while the Uhlmann holonomy characterizes finite-temperature topology. We investigate possible relationships between the Uhlmann phase and the scalar WZ phase, which reflects the Uhlmann and WZ holonomy respectively, in an exemplary four-level model with two doubly degenerate subspaces. Through exact solutions, we contrast the behavior of the Uhlmann and WZ connections and their associated phases. In the zero-temperature limit, the Uhlmann phase may or may not agree with the scalar WZ phase of the degenerate ground states due to obstructions from the Hamiltonian manifested as Dirac points. This is in stark contrast to non-degenerate systems where the correspondence between the Uhlmann and Berry phases in general holds. Our analyses further show that for the example studied here, the Uhlmann phase catches the singular behavior at the Dirac points while the WZ connection and scalar WZ phase vanish along a zero-field axis. We also briefly discuss possible experimental implications.</description>
