      <title>Alternate Computation of Gravitational Effects from a Single Loop of Inflationary Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new computation of the renormalized graviton self-energy induced by a loop of massless, minimally coupled scalars on de Sitter background. Our result takes account of the need to include a finite renormalization of the cosmological constant, which was not included in the first analysis. We also avoid preconceptions concerning structure functions and instead express the result as a linear combination of 21 tensor differential operators. By using our result to quantum-correct the linearized effective field equation we derive logarithmic corrections to both the electric components of the Weyl tensor for gravitational radiation and to the two potentials which quantify the gravitational response to a static point mass.</description>

      <title>Self-force framework for transition-to-plunge waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binaries with asymmetric mass ratios are key expected sources for next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Gravitational self-force theory has been successful in producing post-adiabatic waveforms that describe the quasi-circular inspiral around a non-spinning black hole with sub-radian accuracy, in remarkable agreement with numerical relativity simulations. Current inspiral models, however, break down at the innermost stable circular orbit, missing part of the waveform as the secondary body transitions to a plunge into the black hole. In this work we derive the transition-to-plunge expansion within a multiscale framework and asymptotically match its early-time behaviour with the late inspiral. Our multiscale formulation facilitates rapid generation of waveforms: we build second post-leading transition-to-plunge waveforms, named 2PLT waveforms. Although our numerical results are limited to low perturbative orders, our framework contains the analytic tools for building higher-order waveforms consistent with post-adiabatic inspirals, once all the necessary numerical self-force data becomes available. We validate our framework by comparing against numerical relativity simulations, surrogate models and the effective one-body approach.</description>

      <title>Beyond Schwarzschild: New Pulsating Coordinates for Spherically Symmetric Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a general transformation for spherically symmetric metrics where g\_11=-1/g\_00, we analyze coordinates with the common property of conformal flatness at constant solid angle element. Three general possibilities arise: one where tortoise coordinate appears as the unique solution, other that includes Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates as a very specific case, but that also allows other similar transformations, and finally a new set of coordinates with very different properties than the other two. In particular, this represents any causal patch of the spherically symmetric metrics in a compactified form. We analyze some relations, taking the Schwarzschild case as prototype, but also contrasting the cosmological de-Sitter and Anti-de-Sitter solutions for the new proposed pulsating coordinates.</description>

      <title>Study of Charged Cylindrical Collapse in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{Q})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of electromagnetic field on the gravitational collapse in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{Q})$ theory, where $\mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{R}_{\varphi\vartheta} \mathcal{T}^{\varphi\vartheta}$. For this, we assume dynamical cylindrically symmetric self-gravitating geometry which is coupled with generalized anisotropic matter distribution as well as dissipation flux. We adopt the model $\mathcal{R}+\Phi\sqrt{\mathcal{T}}+\Psi\mathcal{Q}$ to formulate the corresponding dynamical and transport equations by employing the Misner-Sharp as well as M\"{u}ler-Israel Stewart formalisms, where $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ are real-valued coupling constants. The influence of state variables, heat dissipation, charge and the bulk viscosity on the collapsing phenomenon is then studied by establishing some relations between these evolution equations. Moreover, the Weyl scalar and the modified field equations are expressed in terms of each other. We apply some constraints on the considered modified model and the fluid configuration to obtain conformally flat spacetime. Finally, we address different cases to check how the modified corrections and charge affect the collapse rate of cylindrical matter source.</description>

      <title>Maximal acceleration in Rainbow gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive maximal acceleration of a massive particle in Rainbow gravity. Using eight-dimensional phase-space metric compatible with Rainbow gravity, we obtain the maximal acceleration, valid up to first order in the Rainbow gravity parameter $\eta$. Using the positivity condition on maximal acceleration, we find the upper bound on the Rainbow gravity parameter is of the order of $~10^{22}$ for positron and $10^{-44}$ for a black hole. After obtaining the expression for maximal acceleration for different choices of Rainbow functions, we derive corresponding modifications to Unruh temperature. Comparing with the observational value of the Unruh temperature, we find the upper bound on $\eta$ as $~10^{32}$ for positron radiation. %and of the order of $10^{-100}$ for radiation from a black hole. We then derive geodesic equations for different choices of Rainbow functions and also obtain Newtonian limit of these geodesic equations. We find that the changes in the value of maximum acceleration, maximum temperature and Newtonian force equation are dependent on the choices of Rainbow functions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and factor ordering in (1+1)-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using properties of diffusion according to a quantum heat kernel constructed as an expectation over classical heat kernels on $S^1$, we probe the non-manifold-like nature of quantized space in a model of (1+1)-dimensional quantum gravity. By computing the mean squared displacement of a diffusing particle, we find that diffusion is anomalous, behaving similarly to that on a porous substrate, network, or fractal over short distances. The walk dimension of the path for a particle diffusing in quantized space is calculated to have an infimum of 4, rising to arbitrarily large values depending on a parameter labeling the choice of factor ordering in the quantum Hamiltonian for our model and figuring in the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction used to construct the quantum heat kernel. Additionally, we derive an expansion for return probability of a diffusing particle, whose modifications from the classical power-series form depend on the factor-ordering parameter.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum gravity with neural networks: Solving quantum Hamilton constraints of 3d Euclidean gravity in the weak coupling limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 3-dimensional Euclidean gravity in the weak coupling limit of Smolin and show that it is BF-theory with $\text{U(1)}^3$ as a Lie group. The theory is quantised using loop quantum gravity methods. The kinematical degrees of freedom are truncated, on account of computational feasibility, by fixing a graph and deforming the algebra of the holonomies to impose a cutoff on the charge vectors. This leads to a quantum theory related to $\text{U}_q \text{(1)}^3$ BF-theory. The effect of imposing the cutoff on the charges is examined. We also implement the quantum volume operator of 3d loop quantum gravity. Most importantly we compare two constraints for the quantum model obtained: a master constraint enforcing curvature and Gauss constraint, as well as a combination of a quantum Hamilton constraint constructed using Thiemann's strategy and the Gauss master constraint. The two constraints are solved using the neural network quantum state ansatz, demonstrating its ability to explore models which are out of reach for exact numerical methods. The solutions spaces are quantitatively compared and although the forms of the constraints are radically different, the solutions turn out to have a surprisingly large overlap. We also investigate the behavior of the quantum volume in solutions to the constraints.</description>

      <title>Role of local anisotropy in hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Bower-Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars' moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, it has been argued that a proper accounting of the role played by an observer promotes the von Neumann algebra of observables in a given spacetime subregion from Type III to Type II. While this allows for a mathematically precise definition of its entropy, we show that this procedure depends on which observer is employed. We make this precise by considering a setup in which many possible observers are present; by generalising previous approaches, we derive density operators for the subregion relative to different observers (and relative to arbitrary collections of observers), and we compute the associated entropies in a semiclassical regime, as well as in some specific examples that go beyond this regime. We find that the entropies seen by distinct observers can drastically differ. Our work makes extensive use of the formalism of quantum reference frames (QRF); indeed, as we point out, the 'observers' considered here and in the previous works are nothing but QRFs. In the process, we demonstrate that the description of physical states and observables invoked by Chandrasekaran et al. [arXiv:2206.10780] is equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism, leading to the informal slogan "PW=CLPW". It is our hope that this paper will help motivate a long overdue union between the QRF and quantum gravity communities. Further details will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>A deconstruction of methods to derive one-point lensing statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a crucial tool for exploring cosmic phenomena, providing insights into galaxy clustering, dark matter, and dark energy. Given the substantial computational demands of $N$-body simulations, approximate methods like $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\texttt{turboGL}$ offer viable alternatives for simulating lensing probability density functions (PDFs). This paper evaluates these methods in contexts where baryonic effects are negligible, focusing on dark matter-dominated models and assessing their effectiveness across both weak and strong lensing regimes. Our comparative analysis reveals that these methods are particularly effective for applications involving electromagnetic and gravitational wave point sources, where strong lensing events are infrequent. Both $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\texttt{turboGL}$ perform well in modeling the weak-lensing region influenced by mildly nonlinear structures. However, they lose accuracy in capturing small-scale nonlinear matter fields, owing to oversimplified assumptions about internal halo structures and reliance on perturbation theory. The analysis shows that $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ achieves an 8-15% agreement with $N$-body simulations for the second-to-fourth moments of lensing PDFs. These findings aim to inform future studies on gravitational lensing of point sources, which are increasingly relevant with upcoming supernova and gravitational wave datasets.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Stress Tensor and Current at Null Infinity in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the framework that reveals the intrinsic conserved stress tensor and current associated with the null infinity of a three-dimensional ($3d$) asymptotically flat spacetime. These are, respectively, canonical conjugates of degenerate metric and Ehresmann connection of the boundary Carrollian geometry. Their conservation reproduces the Bondi-mass and angular momentum conservation equations if the asymptotic boundary is endowed with a torsional affine connection that we specify. Our analysis and results shed further light on the $3d$ flat holography; the stress tensor and current give rise to an asymptotically flat fluid/gravity correspondence. The requirement of a well-defined $3d$ action principle yields Schwarzian action at null infinity governing the dynamics induced by reparametrizations over the celestial circle, in accord with the codimension $2$ holography of $3d$ flat spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Photon propagator for inflation in the general covariant gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon propagator for power-law inflation is considered in the general covariant gauges within the canonical quantization formalism. Photon mode functions in covariant gauges are considerably more complicated than their scalar counterparts, except for the special choice of the gauge-fixing parameter we call the simple covariant gauge. We explicitly construct the position space photon propagator in the simple covariant gauge, and find the result considerably more complicated than its scalar counterpart. This is because of the need for explicitly inverting the Laplace operator acting on the scalar propagator, which results in Appell's fourth function. Our propagator correctly reproduces the de Sitter and flat space limits. We use this propagator to compute two simple observables: the off-coincident field strength-field strength correlator and the energy-momentum tensor, both of which yield consistent results. As a spinoff of our computation we also give the exact expression for the Coulomb gauge propagator in power-law inflation in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Heat capacity and quantum compressibility of dynamical spacetimes with thermal particle creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work continues the investigation in two recent papers on the quantum thermodynamics of spacetimes, 1) placing what was studied in [1] for thermal quantum fields in the context of early universe cosmology, and 2) extending the considerations of vacuum compressibility of dynamical spaces treated in [2] to dynamical spacetimes with thermal quantum fields. We begin with a warning that thermal equilibrium condition is not guaranteed to exist or maintained in a dynamical setting and thus finite temperature quantum field theory in cosmological spacetimes needs more careful considerations than what is often described in textbooks. A full description requires nonequilibrium quantum field theory in dynamical spacetimes using `in-in' techniques. A more manageable subclass of dynamics is where thermal equilibrium conditions are established at both the beginning and the end of evolution are both well defined. Here we shall assume an in-vacuum state. It has been shown that if the intervening dynamics has an initial period of exponential expansion, such as in inflationary cosmology, particles created from the parametric amplification of the vacuum fluctuations in the initial vacuum will have a thermal spectrum measured at the out-state. Under these conditions finite temperature field theory can be applied to calculate the quantum thermodynamic quantities. Here we consider a massive conformal scalar field in a closed four-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe based on the simple analytically solvable Bernard-Duncan model. We calculate the energy density of particles created from an in-vacuum and derive the partition function. From the free energy we then derive the heat capacity and the quantum compressibility of the spacetimes with thermal particle creation. We end with some discussions and suggestions for further work in this program of studies.</description>

      <title>Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024 spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fate of ultralight black holes depends on whether or not evaporation stops at or around the Planck scale. If evaporation stops, the general expectation is that a population of Planck-scale will be left over, possibly including a significant fraction of electrically charged relics. If evaporation does not stop, a runaway "explosion" would occur, with significant and potentially detectable high-energy emission. Here, I review both possibilities, with an emphasis on current status and future detection prospects.</description>

      <title>Applying the starquake model to study the formation of elastic mountains on spinning neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a neutron star is spun-up or spun-down, the changing strains in its solid elastic crust can give rise to sudden fractures known as starquakes. Early interest in starquakes focused on their possible connection to pulsar glitches. While modern glitch models rely on pinned superfluid vorticity rather than crustal fracture, starquakes may nevertheless play a role in the glitch mechanism. Recently, there has been interest in the issue of starquakes resulting in non-axisymmetric shape changes, potentially linking the quake phenomenon to the building of neutron star mountains, which would then produce continuous gravitational waves. Motivated by this issue, we present a simple model that extends the energy minimisation-based calculations, originally developed to model axisymmetric glitches, to also include non-axisymmetric shape changes. We show that the creation of a mountain in a quake necessarily requires a change in the axisymmetric shape too. We apply our model to the specific problem of the spin-up of an initially non-rotating star, and estimate the maximum mountain that can be built in such a process, subject only to the constraints of energy and angular momentum conservation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy with a non-abelian symmetry group. To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with $SU(2)$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we investigate new constraints on $f(T)$ gravity using the recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) catalog from the full 5-years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN5YR). The $f(T)$ cosmological models considered are characterised by power law late-time accelerated expansion. Our results show that the combination DESI BAO +$r_d$ CMB Planck suggests a Bayesian preference for late-time $f(T)$ cosmological models over $\Lambda$CDM, obtaining a value of $H_0=72.4\pm 2.9$[km/s/Mpc] in agreement with SH0ES collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new degravitation mechanism within the framework of scalar tensor gravity is proposed. The mechanism eliminates all constant contributions from the potential to the Friedmann equation, leaving only the kinematic and the dynamic terms of the potential to drive cosmic acceleration. We explore a scenario involving a density-triggered phase transition in the late-time universe, and argue that the resulting effective energy density and equation of state parameter can explain late-time cosmology when extrapolated to a region of the parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a numerical relativity code based on the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) formulation for the gravitational quadratic $f(R)$ Starobinsky model. By removing the assumption that the determinant of the conformal 3-metric is unity, we first generalize the BSSN formulation for general $f(R)$ gravity theories in the metric formalism to accommodate arbitrary coordinates for the first time. We then describe the implementation of this formalism to the paradigmatic Starobinsky model. We apply the implementation to three scenarios: the Schwarzschild black hole solution, flat space with non-trivial gauge dynamics, and a massless Klein-Gordon scalar field. In each case, long-term stability and second-order convergence is demonstrated. The case of the massless Klein-Gordon scalar field is used to exercise the additional terms and variables resulting from the $f(R)$ contributions. For this model, we show for the first time that additional damped oscillations arise in the subcritical regime as the system approaches a stable configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a two-parameter, static and spherically symmetric regular geometry, which, for specific parameter values represents a regular black hole. The matter required to support such spacetimes within the framework of General Relativity (GR), is found to violate the energy conditions, though not in the entire domain of the radial coordinate. A particular choice of the parameters reduces the regular black hole to a singular, mutated Reissner-Nordstrom geometry. It also turns out that our regular black hole is geodesically complete. Fortunately, despite energy condition violation, we are able to construct a viable source, within the framework of GR coupled to matter, for our regular geometry. The source term involves a nonlinear magnetic monopole in a chosen version of nonlinear electrodynamics. We also suggest an alternative approach towards constructing a source, using the effective Einstein equations which arise in the context of braneworld gravity. Finally, we obtain the circular shadow profile of our regular black hole and provide a preliminary estimate of the metric parameters using recent observational results from the EHT collaboration.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the charged rotating Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) solution in the three-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ system. After the erroneous announcement of its discovery at the end of the original BTZ paper in 1992, the solution was first obtained by Cl\'ement in the paper published in 1996 by coordinate transformations from the charged non-rotating BTZ solution. While Cl\'ement's form of the solution is valid only for ${\Lambda&lt;0}$, we present a new form for a wider range of $\Lambda$ by uniform scaling transformations and a reparametrization. We also introduce new coordinates corresponding to the Doran coordinates in the Kerr spacetime, in which the metric and also its inverse are regular at the Killing horizon, and described by elementary functions. Lastly, we show that (i) the algebraic Cotton type of the spacetime is type III on the Killing horizon and type I away from the horizon, and (ii) the energy-momentum tensor for the Maxwell field is of the Hawking-Ellis type I everywhere.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background for pulsar timing arrays is often modeled by a Gaussian ensemble which is isotropic and unpolarized. However, the Universe has a discrete set of polarized gravitational wave sources at specific sky locations. Can we trust that the Gaussian ensemble is an accurate description? To investigate this, we explicitly construct an ensemble containing $N$ individual binary sources with circular orbits. The orbital inclination angles are randomly distributed, hence the individual sources are elliptically polarized. We then compute the first two moments of the Hellings and Downs correlation, as well as the pulsar-averaged correlation mean and (cosmic) variance. The first moments are the same as for a previously studied ensemble of circularly polarized sources. However, the second moments, and hence the variances, are different for the two ensembles. While neither discrete source model is exactly described by a Gaussian ensemble, we show that in the limit of large $N$, the differences are small.</description>

      <title>Anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a proposed alternative to quantum gravity, in which the spacetime metric is treated as classical, even while matter fields remain quantum. Consistency of the theory necessarily requires that the metric evolve stochastically. Here, we show that this stochastic behaviour leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations. In the low acceleration regime, the variance in the acceleration produced by the gravitational field is high in comparison to that produced by the Newtonian potential, and acts as an entropic force, causing a deviation from Einstein's theory of general relativity. We show that in this "diffusion regime", the entropic force acts from a gravitational point of view, as if it were a contribution to the matter distribution. We compute modifications to the expectation value of the metric via the path integral formalism, and find a stochastic contribution which corresponds to a cosmological constant, anti-correlated with a contribution which has been used to fit galactic rotation curves without dark matter. We caution that a greater understanding of this effect is needed before conclusions can be drawn, most likely through numerical simulations, and provide a template for computing the deviation from general relativity which serves as an experimental signature of the Brownian motion of spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the numerical continued fraction method to investigate quasinormal mode spectra of extremal and non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the low and intermediate damping regions. In the extremal case, we develop techniques that significantly expand the calculated spectrum from what had previously appeared in the literature. This allows us to determine the asymptotic behavior of the extremal spectrum in the high damping limit, where there are conflicting published results. Our investigation further supports the idea that the extremal limit of the non-extremal case, where the charge approaches the mass of the black hole in natural units, leads to the same vibrational spectrum as in the extremal case despite the qualitative differences in their topology. In addition, we numerically explore the quasinormal mode spectrum for a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the small charge limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first numerical study of black hole thermodynamics in Causal Set Theory, focusing on the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole as embodied in the distribution of proposed horizon molecules. To simulate causal sets we created a highly parallelized computational framework in \texttt{C++} which allowed for the generation of causal sets with over a million points, the largest causal sets in a non-conformally flat spacetime to date. Our results confirm that the horizon molecules model is consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula up to a dimensionless constant that can be interpreted as the fundamental discreteness scale in the order of a Planck length. Furthermore, the molecules are found to straddle the horizon of the black hole to within a few Planck lengths, indicating that entropy lives on the surface of the black hole. Finally, possible implications for the information paradox are drawn. In particular, we show how the horizon molecules model could yield a finite black hole temperature cut-off or even prevent full black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Spherical orbits around Kerr-Newman and Ghosh black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study on spherical orbits around two types of black holes: Kerr-Newman black holes, which are charged, and Ghosh black holes, which are nonsingular. In this work, we consider both null and timelike cases of orbits. Utilizing the Mino formalism, all analytical solutions for the geodesics governing these orbits can be obtained. It turns out that all spherical photon orbits outside the black hole horizons are unstable. In the extremal cases of both models, we obtain the {\it photon boomerangs}. The existence of charge in the Kerr-Newman allows the orbits to transition between retrograde and prograde motions, and its increase tends to force the orbits to be more equatorial. On the other hand, the Ghosh black hole, characterized by a regular core and a lack of horizons in certain conditions, presents the possibility of observable stable spherical orbits in the so-called {\it no-horizon} condition. As the Ghosh parameter $k$ increases, trajectories tend to exhibit larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. We observe that as the Ghosh parameter $k$ increases the trajectories tend to have larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we investigate the existence of {\it innermost stable spherical orbits} (ISSOs). Both black holes demonstrate the appearance of two branches of ISSO radii as a function of the Carter constant C. However, there are notable differences in their behavior: in the case of the Kerr-Newman black hole, the branches merge at a critical value, beyond which no ISSO exists, while for the Ghosh black hole, the transcendental nature of the metric function causes the branches to become complex at some finite distance.</description>

Considering different geometric properties of black hole horizon structure, the charged dilaton Lifshitz black hole solutions are presented in 4-dimensional spacetimes. Later, utilizing the Wald Formalism, we derive the thermodynamic first law of black hole and conserved quantities. According to the relationship between the heat capacity and the local stability of black hole, we study the stability of charged Lifshitz black holes and identify the thermodynamic stable region of black holes that meet the criteria.</description>

      <title>Pole-skipping of gravitational waves in the backgrounds of four-dimensional massive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pole-skipping is a property of gravitational waves dictated by their behaviour at horizons of black holes. It stems from the inability to unambiguously impose ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon at an infinite discrete set of Fourier modes. The phenomenon has been best understood, when such a description exists, in terms of dual holographic (AdS/CFT) correlation function that take the value of '0/0' at these special points. In this work, we investigate details of pole-skipping purely from the point of view of classical gravity in 4d massive black hole geometries with flat, spherical and hyperbolic horizons, and with an arbitrary cosmological constant. We show that pole-skipping points naturally fall into two categories: the algebraically special points and a set of pole-skipping points that is common to the even and odd channels of perturbations. Our analysis utilises and generalises (to arbitrary maximally symmetric horizon topology and cosmological constant) the 'integrable' structure of the Darboux transformations, which relate the master field equations that describe the evolution of gravitational perturbations in the two channels. Finally, we provide new insights into a number of special cases: spherical black holes, asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black branes and pole-skipping at the cosmological horizon in de Sitter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An early result of algebraic quantum field theory is that the algebra of any subregion in a QFT is a von Neumann factor of type III$_1$, in which entropy cannot be well-defined because such algebras do not admit a trace or density states. However, associated to the algebra is a modular group of automorphisms characterizing the local dynamics of degrees of freedom in the region, and the crossed product of the algebra with its modular group yields a type II$_\infty$ factor, in which traces and hence von Neumann entropy can be well-defined. In this work, we generalize recent constructions of the crossed product algebra for the TFD to, in principle, arbitrary spacetime regions in arbitrary QFTs, paving the way to the study of entanglement entropy without UV divergences. In contrast to previous works, we emphasize that this construction is independent of gravity. In this sense, the crossed product construction represents a refinement of Haag's assignment of nets of observable algebras to spacetime regions by providing a natural construction of a type II factor. We present several concrete examples: a QFT in Rindler space, a CFT in an open ball of Minkowski space, and arbitrary boundary subregions in AdS/CFT. In the holographic setting, we provide a novel argument for why the bulk dual must be the entanglement wedge, and discuss the distinction arising from boundary modular flow between causal and entanglement wedges for excited states and disjoint regions.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the counterpart selection effect for standard sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disagreement in the Hubble constant measured by different cosmological probes highlights the need for a better understanding of the observations or new physics. The standard siren method, a novel approach using gravitational-wave observations to determine the distance to binary mergers, has great potential to provide an independent measurement of the Hubble constant and shed light on the tension in the next few years. To realize this goal, we must thoroughly understand the sources of potential systematic bias of standard sirens. Among the known sources of systematic uncertainties, selection effects originating from electromagnetic counterpart observations of gravitational-wave sources may dominate the measurements with percent-level bias and no method to mitigate this effect is currently established. In this Letter, we develop a new formalism to mitigate the counterpart selection effect. We show that our formalism can reduce the systematic uncertainty of standard siren Hubble constant measurement to less than the statistical uncertainty with a simulated population of 200 observations ($\lesssim 1\%$) for a realistic electromagnetic emission model. We conclude with how to apply our formalism to different electromagnetic emissions and observing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Causal and stable first-order chiral hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the set of inequalities that is necessary and sufficient for nonlinear causality and linear stability of first-order relativistic hydrodynamics with either a $U(1)_V$ conserved current or a $U(1)_A$ current with a chiral anomaly or both. Our results apply to generic hydrodynamic frames in which no relations among the transport parameters are imposed. Furthermore, our analysis yields, to the best of our knowledge, the first theory of viscous chiral hydrodynamics proven to be causal and stable. We find that causality demands the absence of vorticity-induced heat flux, forcing a departure from the thermodynamic frame in the chiral case. The inequalities for causality and stability define a hypervolume in the space of transport parameters, wherein each point corresponds to a consistent formulation. Notably, causality is determined by just three combinations of transport parameters. We present our results in a form amenable to numerical hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Page curves and replica wormholes from random dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to capture both the non-unitary Page curve and replica wormhole-like contributions that restore unitarity in a toy quantum system with random dynamics. The motivation is to find the simplest dynamical model that captures this aspect of gravitational physics. In our model, we evolve with an ensemble of Hamiltonians with GUE statistics within microcanonical windows. The entropy of the averaged state gives the non-unitary curve, the averaged entropy gives the unitary curve, and the difference comes from matrix index contractions in the Haar averaging that connect the density matrices in a replica wormhole-like manner.</description>

      <title>No U(1) 'electric-magnetic' duality in Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of whether classical general relativity obeys, beyond the linearised order, an analogue of the global U(1) electric-magnetic duality of Maxwell theory, with the Riemann tensor playing the role analogous to the field strength. Following contradictory claims in the literature, we present a simple gauge-invariant argument that the duality does not hold. The duality condition is the conservation of the helicity charge. Scattering amplitudes of gravitons in general relativity, and of gluons in Yang-Mills theory, violate this selection rule already at tree level. Indeed, the maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitudes are famous for their simplicity. The duality in the linearised theories is, therefore, broken by the interactions. In contrast, the tree-level scattering amplitudes in duality-invariant theories of non-linear electromagnetism are known to obey helicity conservation. While the duality is not a symmetry of the full theory of general relativity, it does hold within a sector of the solution space, including vacuum type D solutions, where the duality is known to rotate between mass and NUT charge.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Entropy as a probe of Renormalization Group Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced concept of timelike entanglement entropy has sparked a lot of interest. Unlike the traditional spacelike entanglement entropy, timelike entanglement entropy involves tracing over a timelike subsystem. In this work, we propose an extension of timelike entanglement entropy to Euclidean space ("temporal entanglement entropy"), and relate it to the renormalization group (RG) flow. Specifically, we show that tracing over a period of Euclidean time corresponds to coarse-graining the system and can be connected to momentum space entanglement. We employ Holography, a framework naturally embedding RG flow, to illustrate our proposal. Within cutoff holography, we establish a direct link between the UV cutoff and the smallest resolvable time interval within the effective theory through the irrelevant $T\bar T$ deformation. Increasing the UV cutoff results in an enhanced capability to resolve finer time intervals, while reducing it has the opposite effect. Moreover, we show that tracing over a larger Euclidean time interval is formally equivalent to integrating out more UV degrees of freedom (or lowering the temperature). As an application, we point out that the temporal entanglement entropy can detect the critical Lifshitz exponent $z$ in non-relativistic theories which is not accessible from spatial entanglement at zero temperature and density.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Gravity, Dark Energy and Conformal Symmetry: Testing the Hierarchies of Anomaly-Induced Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal back-reaction generates cosmological models where the trace anomaly reflects the breaking of Weyl invariance. Analyzing these actions yields a dynamic approach to dark energy through anomaly-induced actions (AIAs), that are variational solutions of the trace anomaly functional constraint. Expanded around Minkowski space, they produce semiclassical correlators subject to hierarchical anomalous Ward identities, tied to conformal symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance. We focus on comparing the hierarchy of a specific 4-point function, particularly the 2-gravitons-2-photons correlator $(TTJJ)$, generated by AIAs, to free field theory realizations of the same correlator. We observe that the free field theory original hierarchy splits into one ordinary and one anomalous hierarchy, both satisfying the conservation Ward identities from diffeomorphism invariance. However, we find that the anomalous hierarchy derived from ordinary AIAs in both the Riegert or Fradkin-Vilkovisky gauges, are either affected by double poles or violate the hierarchy of the trace Ward identity, respectively. We show that correct forms of the anomalous hierarchies of 4-point functions (for the $TTTT$ and $TTJJ$), identified in a perturbative free field theory expansion around flat space, are characterised by anomaly poles, corresponding to a curvature expansion in $R\Box^{-1}$, together with Weyl invariant terms. We derive the effective action that generates the correct form of the hierarchy for the $TTJJ$.</description>

      <title>On the Meaning of Local Symmetries: Epistemic-Ontological Dialectics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose our account of the meaning of local symmetries. We argue that the general covariance principle and gauge principle both are principles of democratic epistemic access to the law of physics, leading to ontological insights about the objective nature of spacetime. We further argue that relationality is a core notion of general-relativistic gauge field theory, tacitly encoded by its (active) local symmetries.</description>
