      <title>Long-term sedimentary earthquake records along the northern branch of the North Anatolian Fault in the Sea of Marmara (NW T\"urkiye)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geological earthquake records are important for probabilistic seismic risk assessment. Such records can be obtained from studies of turbidites triggered by seismic activity in marine and lake basins. The Sea of Marmara (SoM), located on the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), serves as an important laboratory for subaqueous palaeoseismological research. This is because it has 2500 yrs. of historical earthquake records that can be correlated with radiometrically dated sedimentary earthquake records. Additionally, the relatively high sedimentation rate ($\sim$3 mm/yr) in the deep subbasins allows the recognition of individual events. Following the destructive 1912 Mw 7.4 \c{S}ark\"oy-M\"urefte and 1999 Mw 7.4 Izmit and Mw 7.2 D\"uzce earthquakes, the main submerged part of the NAF in the SoM represents a seismic gap, where the long-term earthquake history is of crucial importance for earthquake risk assessment. We have studied nine cores recovered along the most active northern strand of the NAF (i.e. the Main Marmara Fault: MMF), using high resolution digital X-ray radiography, $\mu$-XRF core scanning, MSCL physical properties and grain-size analyses. The chronology was determined using accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon and radionuclide methods. In the cores, coseismic turbidites commonly consist of a basal part with multiple sand-silt laminae above a sharp and often erosional base and an overlying graded mud part (homogenite). The basal parts exhibit high gamma density and MS, and are often enriched in one or more elements, such as Si, K, Fe, Ti, Zr, Ca and Sr, indicative of coarse siliciclastic and carbonate shell fragments. Radionuclide- and radiocarbon-dated coseismic turbidites in different SoM subbasins extending back to more than 5000 yrs. indicate an average earthquake recurrence time between 220 and 300 yrs. along the different segments of the MMF. These results are compatible with the GPS velocities and geological slip rates. However, the intervals between two consecutive events vary widely between 50 and 695 yrs. for the different northern NAF segments. Integration of our results with previous studies indicates that the M &gt; 7 events recorded are the 1999, 1509, 1296 and 740 earthquakes on the __zmit Gulf segment; the 1894, 1509, 1343, 1090 and 740 earthquakes on the Prince Islands segment in the \c{C}{\i}narc{\i}k Basin; the 1894, 1766, 1509, 989, 869 or 862, 740 and 447 earthquakes on the Central High segment and in the Central Basin; and the 1912, 1766, 1344, 989 and 447 earthquakes on the western Marmara segment. The 1912 \c{S}ark\"oy-M\"urefte earthquake record is absent in the Central Basin, which suggests that the earthquake rupture did not extend beyond the western end of the Western High. The distribution of the 2500 yr-long sedimentary earthquake records matched with the historical earthquakes along the MMF indicates the common occurrence of multiple-segment ruptures, and suggests that presently, the most earthquake-prone part of the MMF is the Central High segment, located SW of Istanbul.</description>

      <title>Representative-volume sizing in finite cylindrical computed tomography by low-wavenumber spectral convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choosing a representative element volume (REV) from finite cylindrical $\mu$CT scans becomes ambiguous when a key field variable exhibits a slow axial trend, because estimated statistics can change systematically with subvolume size and position rather than converging under simple averaging. A practical workflow is presented to size an REV under such nonstationary conditions by first suppressing axial drift/trend to obtain a residual field suitable for second-order analysis, and then selecting the smallest analysis diameter for which low-wavenumber content stabilizes within a prescribed tolerance. The approach is demonstrated on \textit{Thalassinoides}-bearing rocks, whose branching, connected burrow networks impose heterogeneity on length scales comparable to typical laboratory core diameters, making imaging-based microstructural statistics and downstream digital-rock proxies highly sensitive to the chosen subvolume. From segmented data, a scalar ``burrowsity'' field--capturing burrow-related pore spaces and infills--is defined, and axial detrending (with optional normalization) is applied to mitigate acquisition drift and nonstationary trends. Representativeness is then posed as a diameter-convergence problem on nested inscribed cylinders: the two-point covariance and its isotropic spectral counterpart $\widehat{C}$ are estimated, and the smallest diameter at which the low-wavenumber plateau becomes stable is selected. Applied to a segmented \textit{Thalassinoides} core, the method identifies a minimum analysis cylinder of approximately $D_{\mathrm{REV}}\approx 93~\mathrm{mm}$ and $H_{\mathrm{REV}}\approx 83~\mathrm{mm}$, enabling reproducible correlation-scale reporting and connectivity-sensitive property estimation.</description>

      <title>Smooth surface reconstruction of earthquake faults from distributed moment-potency-tensor solutions</title>

Abstract: Earthquake faults as observed by seismic motions primarily manifest as displacement discontinuities within elastic continua. The displacement discontinuity and the surface normal vector (n-vector) of such an idealized earthquake source are measured by the tensor of potency, which is seismic moment normalized by stiffness. This study formulates an inverse problem to reconstruct a smooth 3D fault surface from an areal density field of the potency tensor. Here, the surface is represented by an elevation field, while nodal planes of the potency density represent the surface normal (n-vector) field, reducing the problem to an n-vector-to-elevation transform. Although this transform is a one-to-one mapping in 2D, it becomes overdetermined in 3D because the n-vector has two degrees of freedom while the scalar elevation has only one, admitting no solution in general. This overdeterminacy originates from modeling the potency density, the inelastic strain with six degrees of freedom, as a displacement discontinuity of five degrees of freedom. Whereas this overdeterminacy is the violation of the determinant-free constraint in point potency sources, it appears as a conflict with the global consistency of the n-vector field in areal potency densities. Recognizing this capacity of the potency density to describe inelastic strain incompatible with displacement discontinuity, we introduce an a priori constraint to define the fault as the smooth surface that best approximates inelastic strain as displacement discontinuity. We derive an analytical solution for this formulation and demonstrate its ability to reproduce 3D surfaces from noisy synthetic n-vectors. We integrate this formula into potency density tensor inversion and apply it to the 2013 Balochistan earthquake. The estimated 3D geometry shows better agreement with observed fault traces than previous quasi-2D methods, validating our proposal.</description>
