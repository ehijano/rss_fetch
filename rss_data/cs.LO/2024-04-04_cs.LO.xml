      <title>Commutative N-polyregular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two questions regarding N-polyregular functions, that forms a proper subset of N-rational series. We show that given a Z-rational series, it is decidable whether it is computable via a commutative N-polyregular function, and provide a counter-example to the theorem of Karhum\"aki that studied the same question in the case of polynomials. We also prove that it is decidable whether a commutative N-polyregular function is star-free, by proving the stronger statement that star-free Z-polyregular functions that are N-polyregular are in fact computable using a star-free N-polyregular function. Building towards answering the same questions in the non-commutative case, we present a canonical model of computation of N-polyregular functions by generalizing the notion of residual transducers previously introduced in Z-polyregular functions.</description>

      <title>Interpolant Existence is Undecidable for Two-Variable First-Order Logic with Two Equivalence Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpolant existence problem (IEP) for a logic L is to decide, given formulas P and Q, whether there exists a formula I, built from the shared symbols of P and Q, such that P entails I and I entails Q in L. If L enjoys the Craig interpolation property (CIP), then the IEP reduces to validity in L. Recently, the IEP has been studied for logics without the CIP. The results obtained so far indicate that even though the IEP can be computationally harder than validity, it is decidable when L is decidable. Here, we give the first examples of decidable fragments of first-order logic for which the IEP is undecidable. Namely, we show that the IEP is undecidable for the two-variable fragment with two equivalence relations and for the two-variable guarded fragment with individual constants and two equivalence relations. We also determine the corresponding decidable Boolean description logics for which the IEP is undecidable.</description>

      <title>Techniques for Measuring the Inferential Strength of Forgetting Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technique of forgetting in knowledge representation has been shown to be a powerful and useful knowledge engineering tool with widespread application. Yet, very little research has been done on how different policies of forgetting, or use of different forgetting operators, affects the inferential strength of the original theory. The goal of this paper is to define loss functions for measuring changes in inferential strength based on intuitions from model counting and probability theory. Properties of such loss measures are studied and a pragmatic knowledge engineering tool is proposed for computing loss measures using Problog. The paper includes a working methodology for studying and determining the strength of different forgetting policies, in addition to concrete examples showing how to apply the theoretical results using Problog. Although the focus is on forgetting, the results are much more general and should have wider application to other areas.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic Satisfiability Checking for Arithmetic $\mu$-Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus provides a generic semantic framework for fixpoint logics over systems whose branching type goes beyond the standard relational setup, e.g. probabilistic, weighted, or game-based. Previous work on the coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus includes an exponential-time upper bound on satisfiability checking, which however relies on the availability of tableau rules for the next-step modalities that are sufficiently well-behaved in a formally defined sense; in particular, rule matches need to be representable by polynomial-sized codes, and the sequent duals of the rules need to absorb cut. While such rule sets have been identified for some important cases, they are not known to exist in all cases of interest, in particular ones involving either integer weights as in the graded $\mu$-calculus, or real-valued weights in combination with non-linear arithmetic. In the present work, we prove the same upper complexity bound under more general assumptions, specifically regarding the complexity of the (much simpler) satisfiability problem for the underlying one-step logic, roughly described as the nesting-free next-step fragment of the logic. The bound is realized by a generic global caching algorithm that supports on-the-fly satisfiability checking. Notably, our approach directly accommodates unguarded formulae, and thus avoids use of the guardedness transformation. Example applications include new exponential-time upper bounds for satisfiability checking in an extension of the graded $\mu$-calculus with polynomial inequalities (including positive Presburger arithmetic), as well as an extension of the (two-valued) probabilistic $\mu$-calculus with polynomial inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.13771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We fill a gap in the study of contextuality by extending the sheaf-theoretic framework for non-locality by Abramsky and Brandenburger to deal with operational scenarios in the presence of arbitrary definite causal orders.</description>

      <title>Robustness Assessment of a Runway Object Classifier for Safe Aircraft Taxiing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming the prominent solution for many computational problems, the aviation industry seeks to explore their potential in alleviating pilot workload and in improving operational safety. However, the use of DNNs in this type of safety-critical applications requires a thorough certification process. This need can be addressed through formal verification, which provides rigorous assurances -- e.g.,~by proving the absence of certain mispredictions. In this case-study paper, we demonstrate this process using an image-classifier DNN currently under development at Airbus and intended for use during the aircraft taxiing phase. We use formal methods to assess this DNN's robustness to three common image perturbation types: noise, brightness and contrast, and some of their combinations. This process entails multiple invocations of the underlying verifier, which might be computationally expensive; and we therefore propose a method that leverages the monotonicity of these robustness properties, as well as the results of past verification queries, in order to reduce the overall number of verification queries required by nearly 60%. Our results provide an indication of the level of robustness achieved by the DNN classifier under study, and indicate that it is considerably more vulnerable to noise than to brightness or contrast perturbations.</description>
