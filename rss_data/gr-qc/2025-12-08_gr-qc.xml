      <title>Effective $f(Q)$ model emerging from $f(Q,T)$ under a special EOS limit in symmetric cosmology with Bayesian and ANN observational constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the cosmological consequences of an effective $f(Q)$ model emerging from the more general $f(Q,T)$ gravity theory under the special equation-of-state condition $\rho + p = 0$. Under this limit, the field equations yield the constraint $F(Q,T)H(t)=C$, implying that the function $F=f_Q$ becomes purely dependent on the nonmetricity scalar $Q$, and the background evolution mimics that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We derive the resulting functional forms of $f(Q)$, obtain the corresponding effective cosmological constant, and analyze the physical nature of this reduction. To test the model against observations, we constrain the parameters $H_0$, $\Omega_m$, and $S_8$ using cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Pantheon+ SN Ia datasets. A comparative analysis is performed using both the conventional Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and a machine-learning based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) emulator. We find that the ANN approach yields tighter posterior constraints while significantly reducing computational time. The model successfully reproduces the observational trends of each dataset and offers insights into the persistent $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. Our results indicate that effective nonmetricity-based dark energy scenarios derived from $f(Q,T)$ gravity provide a viable and observationally consistent alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, with future high-precision surveys expected to further distinguish between these frameworks.</description>

      <title>Images from disk and spherical accretions of Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the shadow and optical appearance of the Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) illuminated by various static accretions. First, we find that as the dark matter parameter $\left|\alpha\right|$ increases, the fundamental characteristic quantities of the black hole, the event horizon $r_h$, the photon sphere radius $r_{ph}$, and the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$ all increase, while the peak of the effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}$ decreases and shifts toward the direction of increasing $r$. In contrast, the magnetic charge parameter $g$ suppresses $r_h$, $r_{ph}$, and $b_{ph}$, while increases the peak of $V_{\text{eff}}$ and shifts it toward the direction of decreasing $r$. This indicates a competing effect between the dark matter parameter $\left|\alpha\right|$ and the magnetic charge parameter $g$ on the fundamental properties of the black hole. Furthermore, we use the EHT observational data to constrain the dark matter parameters $\alpha$ and find that the constraint range given by the supermassive black hole SgrA* is stricter than that of the black hole M87*. Finally, the black hole images are studied based on different accretion models, and it is found that both dark matter parameters $\alpha$ and accretion models significantly influence the black hole images. For larger dark matter parameters $\left|\alpha\right|$, the inner shadow or central faint illuminating region of the Bardeen black hole surrounded by PFDM is larger but the bright ring of the image is fainter. This provides a potential method for us to distinguish between classical Bardeen black holes and Bardeen black holes surrounded by PFDM. These preliminary results may provide some clues for future investigations of dark matter using black hole shadows and images.</description>

      <title>Black-hole ringdown with templates capturing spin precession: a critical re-analysis of GW190521</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a binary black-hole merger provides a clean probe of strong-field gravity, as it can be modeled with minimal assumptions. The quasi-normal-mode frequencies encode the mass and spin of the Kerr black-hole remnant, while the mode excitation depends on the progenitor binary. In this paper, we implement a recently developed amplitude model that captures spin precession in a simulation-based inference pipeline that specifically targets ringdown signals. We present a critical re-analysis of GW190521 -- a short-duration, merger-dominated event with conflicting interpretations. Spin-aligned and precessing analyses at two ringdown start times show that precession induces modest but systematic shifts in inferred parameters and subdominant mode amplitudes, although such ringdown-only analyses provide no strong evidence for precession. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of physics-informed precessing ringdown modelling, paving the way for the identification of spin precession in gravitational-wave events using solely their ringdown stages, where waveform systematics are expected to be substantially less prominent.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of deformed extremal horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that extremal black holes can act as amplifiers of new physics, due to horizon instabilities that enhance the effects of ultraviolet corrections. In this paper, we revisit some of these claims and investigate the viability of a class of non-spherical extremal black holes. In particular, we revisit the regularity of perturbed extremal Reissner--Nordstr\"om AdS black holes showing that, while some certain components of the scalar stress energy tensor diverge, the backreaction remains finite. We also study geodesic completeness, identifying a simple geometric constraint which, if satisfied, ensures that null geodesics cross the horizon smoothly. This analysis suggests the existence of a broad class of spacetimes with regular non-spherical horizons.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Penrose process in Kerr-de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, references [1,2] found that the repetitive Penrose process cannot extract all the extractable rotational energy of a Kerr black hole, and reference [3] found that the repetitive electric Penrose process cannot extract all the electrical energy of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole. This suggests that a law analogous to the third law of thermodynamics exists for the repetitive Penrose process. In this paper, we intend to study the repetitive Penrose process in the Kerr-de Sitter (Kerr-dS) black hole. We will explore influences of the cosmological parameter on the repetitive Penrose process. The results show that, in addition to a similar third law of thermodynamics, the Kerr-dS black hole yields a higher energy return on investment (EROI) and single-extraction energy capability compared to the Kerr black hole. Specifically, the larger the cosmological parameter, the stronger the EROI and the single-extraction energy capability. Furthermore, we also find that at a lower decay radius, the Kerr black hole exhibits a higher energy utilization efficiency (EUE) and more extracted energy after the repetitive Penrose process is completed. However, at a higher decay radius, the situation is reversed, i.e., the Kerr-dS black hole exhibits a higher EUE and more extracted energy, which is due to the existence of stopping condition of the iteration.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers for regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers (TLNs) characterize the response of compact objects to external tidal fields and vanish for classical Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes in general relativity. Nonvanishing TLNs therefore provide a potential observational window into new physics. In this work, we present a unified and fully analytic study of the TLNs of three representative classes of regular black holes -- the Bardeen black hole,the black hole with sub-Planckian curvature, and the black hole arising in asymptotically safe gravity -- under scalar, vector, and axial gravitational perturbations. Employing a Green's function method combined with systematic perturbative expansions, we show that TLNs of regular black holes are generically nonzero and exhibit strong model and mode dependence. In many cases, higher-order corrections develop logarithmic scale dependence, closely resembling renormalization-group running in quantum field theory and revealing a scale-dependent tidal response absent in classical black holes. Our analysis demonstrates that the internal structure of regular black holes, including de Sitter or Minkowski cores and quantum-gravity-inspired modifications, leaves distinct fingerprints in their tidal properties. These results establish TLNs as promising probes for testing regular black hole models with future gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Thermal Damping of Mass-Modulating Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological evolution of a scalar field is shaped by Hubble damping. Any non-gravitational couplings of the scalar with the primordial thermal bath generically contribute additional damping. Although rarely considered, such thermal damping could be the dominant dissipative effect. We derive approximate but highly general thermal-damping rates of scalar fields that modulate the masses of thermally populated particles. We extend previous results to cover cases of particular phenomenological interest where the scalar background oscillates sinusoidally but not necessarily slowly compared to the thermalization rates of the primordial bath. Based on these results, we estimate the thermal damping of scalars coupled to neutrinos linearly, to gluons quadratically, and to WIMPs linearly, and demonstrate its importance in certain parameter space of these models. We also estimate the thermal damping rates in models of QCD axion.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Discontinuous Galerkin Algorithm for Particle Kinetics on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel, conservative discontinuous Galerkin algorithm is presented for particle kinetics on manifolds. The motion of particles on the manifold is represented using using both canonical and non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations. Our schemes apply to either formulations, but the canonical formulation results in a particularly efficient scheme that also conserves particle density and energy exactly. The collisionless update is coupled to a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator that provides a simplified model for relaxation to local thermodynamic equilibrium. An iterative scheme is constructed to ensure collisional invariants (density, momentum and energy) are preserved numerically. Rotation of the manifold is incorporated by modifying the Hamiltonian while ensuring a canonical formulation. Several test problems, including a kinetic version of the classical Sod-shock problem, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surfaces of a sphere and a paraboloid, with and without rotations, is presented. A prospectus for further development of this approach to simulation of kinetic theory in general relativity is presented.</description>

      <title>How Dark Sector Equations of State Govern Interaction Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using late-Universe observations, we demonstrate that freeing dark energy and dark matter equations of state (EoS) dramatically alters the inferred strength and direction of their interactions. When dark sector EoS are fixed to $w_{\mathrm{de}}=-1$ and $w_{\mathrm{dm}}=0$, the data consistently favor an energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter across various interaction forms. This apparent evidence, however, proves highly sensitive to the EoS assumptions: treating $w_{\mathrm{de}}$ as a free parameter substantially weakens the evidence for interaction, with its value converging to the quintessence regime ($w_{\mathrm{de}}&gt;-1$). In contrast, freeing $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ maintains a preference for interaction, revealing a correlation where positive $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ is associated with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, and negative $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ with energy transfer from dark matter to dark energy. These findings caution against the simplistic assumption of $\Lambda$CDM EoS values when attempting to detect a possible interaction. Despite these fundamental degeneracies, model comparison using the Akaike and Deviance information criteria shows that all of the tested interacting dark energy scenarios receive substantial support over the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Machine and Deep Learning Regression for Compact Object Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central open problem in nuclear physics is the determination of a physically robust equation of state (EoS) for dense nuclear matter, which directly informs our understanding of the internal composition and macroscopic properties of compact objects such as neutron stars and quark stars. Traditional efforts have relied primarily on theoretical modeling grounded in nuclear and particle physics, with subsequent validation against empirical constraints from heavy ion collisions and, increasingly, multimessenger astrophysical observations. Recent developments, however, have introduced complementary analytical strategies that merge theoretical modeling with advanced data driven methodologies. In particular, Bayesian inference, machine learning, and deep learning have emerged as powerful tools for constraining the EoS and extracting physical insight from complex observational datasets. In this work, we employ state of the art machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze mass radius relations of compact objects with the aim of reconstructing or inferring their underlying equations of state. The analysis is based on an extensive library of physically consistent, multimodal EoSs for neutron stars and a corresponding set for quark stars, each constructed to satisfy established theoretical and observational constraints. By leveraging the predictive capacity of these computational frameworks, we demonstrate the potential of data-driven approaches to provide refined insights into the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities and to contribute to a more unified understanding of the dense matter EoS.</description>

      <title>Conformal transformations of metric spaces and Lorentzian pre-length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce conformal transformations in the synthetic setting of metric spaces and Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces. Our main focus lies on the Lorentzian case, where, motivated by the need to extend classical notions to spaces of low regularity, we provide the first consistent notion of conformal length, and analyse its fundamental properties. We prove that the conformal time separation function $\tau_{\Omega}$ (and the causal structure it induces) yields a Lorentzian pre-length structure if the original space is intrinsic and strongly causal. This allows us to construct a notion of conformal transformation between spaces within this class, yielding an equivalence relation. As applications, we show that the conformal length functional agrees with the standard conformal length of (strongly causal) spacetimes. We also prove conformal invariance of angles and causality conditions, give a characterisation of global hyperbolicity via finiteness of $\tau_{\Omega}$ for all conformal factors, and establish the behaviour of the Lorentzian Hausdorff measure defined in [MS22a] under conformal changes. Moreover, we apply the same methods to the metric case, which is of interest in its own right. This is exemplified by proving an analog of the Nomizu--Ozeki theorem for metric length spaces, which has the advantage that the resulting complete space is conformally related to the original space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is expected to accumulate inside neutron stars, modifying the structure of isolated stars and influencing both the dynamics of binary mergers and the evolution of the resulting hypermassive remnants. Since differential rotation is the primary mechanism delaying the collapse of these remnants, understanding its behavior is crucial when assessing the impact of an embedded dark component. In this work, we extend the numerical code RNS to describe two gravitationally coupled fluids in differential rotation, with baryonic matter modeled by a realistic nuclear equation of state and dark matter represented as a self-interacting bosonic condensate. Within this framework, we construct equilibrium sequences for a representative differential rotation law, providing a basis to explore how dark matter may influence the global properties and rotational dynamics of binary neutron star remnants.</description>

      <title>Black-hole evaporation for cosmological observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the evaporation of black holes immersed in a de Sitter environment, using the Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime. The role of cosmological observers is highlighted in the development and Hayward thermodynamics for non-stationary geometries is employed in the description of the compact objects. The results of the proposed dynamical model are compared with the usual description based on stationary geometries, with specific results for primordial black holes (PBHs). The timescale of evaporation is shown to depend significantly on the choice of cosmological observer and can differ substantially from predictions based on stationary models at late times. Deviations are also shown with respect to the standard assertion that there is a fixed initial mass just below $10^{15} \, \text{g} \sim 10^{-18} M_\odot$ for the PBHs which are completing their evaporation process at the present epoch.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes in vacuum within the framework of $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} + \alpha \mathbb{Q}^2$ gravity, and compare them with those in $f(\mathbb{T}) = \mathbb{T} + \alpha \mathbb{T}^2$ gravity. Based on the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, we notice that the gravitational effects arise from non-metricity (the covariant derivative of metrics) in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity rather than curvature in $f(R)$ or torsion in $f(\mathbb{T})$. Using the finite difference method and the sixth-order WKB method, we compute the quasinormal modes of massless scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations. Tables of quasinormal frequencies for various parameter configurations are provided based on the sixth-order WKB method. Our findings reveal the differences in the quasinormal modes of black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity compared to those in $f(R)$ and $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity. This variation demonstrates the impact of different parameter values, offering insights into the characteristics of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. These results provide the theoretical groundwork for assessing alternative gravities' viability through gravitational wave data, and aid probably in picking out the alternative gravity theory that best aligns with the empirical reality.</description>

      <title>Null energy condition violation and beyond Horndeski physics in light of DESI DR2 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflation and dark energy (DE), both featuring accelerated expansion, are crucial components of modern cosmology. As indicated by singularity theorems, null energy condition (NEC) violation is essential for resolving the initial singularity of inflation. The latest DESI DR2 results show that the DE equation of state evolves from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ at redshift $z \lesssim 1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ today, reinforcing interest in testing NEC violation in the observable Universe. Within a unified effective field theory framework that applies to both inflation and DE, we use DESI DR2 data and a non-parametric reconstruction approach to test, for the first time, the ``beyond Horndeski'' physics known to support fully stable NEC violation in nonsingular cosmology. Therefore, our work provides a novel avenue to constrain the physics underlying NEC violation in a model agnostic way. It also highlights the potential relevance of NEC violation to both the primordial Universe and late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Causal structure and topology change in (2+1)-dimensional simplicial gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for analyzing the causal structure at vertices in (2+1)-dimensional Lorentzian simplicial gravity. By examining the intersection patterns of lightcones emanating from a vertex with its simplicial neighbourhood, we identify 13 distinct causal types of Lorentzian tetrahedra -- excluding configurations with null faces. This classification forms the basis for a topological characterization of the local causal structure in terms of the number of connected regions on the triangulated 2-sphere that are spacelike and timelike separated from a bulk vertex. These local causal data allow us to identify regular causal configurations and new types of irregular causal configurations, generalizing well-known (1+1)-dimensional topologies, such as `Trousers' and `Yarmulkes', to higher dimensions.
  We further investigate the dynamical implications of vertex causality by analyzing the behaviour of deficit angles and the Regge action in explicit configurations. Transitions in `vertex-causality' coincide with discontinuities in the curvature, suggesting discrete topology change. Causally irregular hinges correspond to discrete conical singularities, while vertex causal irregularities manifest as point-like singularities. Interestingly, we find that vertex and hinge causality are generally independent. These results have direct implications for discrete quantum gravity approaches where the emergence of semiclassical spacetime depends on how causal structures are encoded within the triangulation.</description>

      <title>Exploring black holes with multiple photon spheres by interferometric signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the interferometric signatures of hairy Schwarzschild black holes (hSBHs) that have either single or double photon spheres. Our interest mainly stems from two considerations: (i) the photon ring structure in black hole images produces strong and universal interferometric signatures on long baselines, enabling precision measurements of black hole parameters and testing gravitational theory; (ii) the hSBH describes the deformation of standard Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) induced by additional sources, and they can feature double photon spheres within certain parameter regimes. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that for a hSBH with a single photon sphere, the complex visibility amplitude of the image exhibits damped oscillations. A similar behavior appears in the double photon sphere case when the inner photon sphere has lower effective potential than the outer one, as the photons near the inner photon sphere remain trapped by gravity. However, when the inner potential is higher, a beat pattern rises. Our findings reveal that the complex visibility amplitude can encode the signature of the photon sphere structure of the central black hole.</description>

      <title>Pseudospectrum and time-domain analysis of the EFT corrected black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the linear perturbations of a spherically symmetric black hole corrected by dimension-6 terms in the effective field theory (EFT) of gravity. The solution is asymptotically flat and characterized by two parameters -- a mass parameter $M$ and a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon$ related to the EFT length scale $l$, and the perturbation equation incorporates a velocity factor which is not constant. The quasinormal modes (QNMs) and time-domain waveforms are studied within the hyperboloidal framework. This approach reproduces the breakdown of the isospectrality and reveals that higher overtones are more sensitive to $\varepsilon$. As for the time domain, the mismatch function is introduced and found to scale as $\varepsilon^2$, which demonstrates that the waveform is stable as $\varepsilon$ varies. Finally, a velocity-dependent energy norm is employed to compute the pseudospectrum and characterize the migration of the QNM spectrum. We further define a quantity $\epsilon_c$ that describes the magnitude of the instability of a QNM spectrum. Our analysis reveals that the dependence of $\epsilon_c$ on $\varepsilon$ is complicated -- it may increase, decrease or even be nonmonotonic.</description>

      <title>Constraining the rotating Simpson-Visser spacetime from the observed quasi-periodic oscillations in black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regular black holes (BHs) which are singularity-free alternatives to the standard black hole paradigm in General Relativity (GR), offer effective models for probing the interface between classical and quantum gravity. They serve as promising candidates for exploring the nature of strong gravity and potential extensions of GR by providing testing grounds to understand how quantum corrections might manifest in astrophysical black holes. In the present work, we investigate the regular BH scenario described by the Simpson-Visser (SV) spacetime and explore its imprints on the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the black hole power spectrum. The Simpson-Visser spacetime represent the simplest, globally regular extensions of the Schwarzschild scenario, through the presence of a regularizing parameter. We explore the imprints of the regularizing parameter on the orbital and epicyclic frequencies associated with the motion of test particles in the rotating SV spacetime. Models aimed to explain the observed HFQPOs often invoke these fundamental frequencies and hence can potentially constrain the regularizing parameter from the available HFQPO data. We test eleven well-established HFQPO models against available observations from six black hole sources, obtaining spin constraints that, when compared with previous independent estimates, help identify the observationally favored models for each source. Based on the present data, we report that the observationally favored models cannot discriminate between the Kerr and the Simpson-Visser scenario. This when coupled with the large discrepancy in previous spin estimates of these sources, may plausibly indicate some deviation from GR in the strong gravity regime near BHs which requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Robust Non-Singular Bouncing Cosmology from Regularized Hyperbolic Field Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete and robust framework for non-singular bouncing cosmology in a closed universe, where the scalar field space is endowed with a regularized hyperbolic geometry. The field space metric $g^S_{\chi\chi} = (1 + e^{-2\alpha\phi/M_{\mathrm{Pl}}})^{-1}$ is rigorously derived from fundamental physical principles: (i) exponential suppression during contraction enabling the bounce mechanism, (ii) asymptotic saturation to unity during inflation preserving perturbative unitarity, and (iii) positive-definiteness ensuring ghost-freedom. We prove that the sigmoid function emerges uniquely as the minimal-complexity solution satisfying these boundary conditions, with deep connections to hyperbolic geometry and cosmological $\alpha$-attractors. Through comprehensive numerical validation, we demonstrate that the model achieves 60+ e-folds of inflation following a non-singular bounce without violating the Null Energy Condition. The sigmoid regularization expands the basin of attraction by $\sim 10^{21}$ compared to the pure exponential metric, achieving 100\% success rate across 16 orders of magnitude in initial velocities. The model is compatible with the BKL conjecture (anisotropic shear suppressed by spatial curvature) and solves the flatness problem (only $\sim 3.5$ e-folds needed for $|\Omega_k| &lt; 0.001$). Perturbation equations remain regular throughout the bounce, and the comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$ is conserved on super-Hubble scales. Observable predictions ($n_s \approx 0.967$, $r \approx 0.003$) are independent of the regularization parameter $\alpha$, in excellent agreement with Planck 2018 data and testable by next-generation CMB experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a search for gravitational waves from inspiraling, planetary-mass ultra-compact binaries using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA. Finding no evidence of such systems, we determine the maximum distance reach for such objects and their merger rate densities, independently of how they could have formed. Then, we identify classes of primordial black-hole mass distributions for which these rate limits can be translated into relevant constraints on the mass distribution of primordial black holes, assuming that they compose all of dark matter, in the mass range $[10^{-6},10^{-3}]M_\odot$. Our constraints are consistent with existing microlensing results in the planetary-mass range, and provide a complementary probe to sub-solar mass objects.</description>

      <title>Many Worlds in Theory Space: A Quantum Origin for the Constants of Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of the numbers appearing in the laws of physics, such as the strength of electromagnetism or the masses of elementary particles, must lie in precise ranges for stars, planets, and chemistry to exist. Why the universe has these values is one of the deepest questions in science. Here we propose that these constants arise from quantum mechanics itself. By enlarging the configuration space of quantum cosmology, we treat the constants of nature as part of the wavefunction of the universe. The universal wavefunction contains support for many possible sets of constants, and early-universe processes cause these possibilities to decohere into distinct classical universes. Our universe is one such branch, compatible with complexity and life. We defined the Grand Hilbert Space as the direct sum of U-sectors, each representing a distinct set of physical laws. We derived the Meta-Wheeler--DeWitt equation, which governs the dynamics of the theory parameters. We showed that in the Planck era, the kinetic terms for these parameters are active, creating a state of primordial coherence where the laws of physics effectively fluctuate. This formalism offers a quantitative tool for high-energy physics. We proposed that the total integrated amplitude over theory space serves as a Bayesian evidence metric, allowing for the statistical comparison of rival microscopic theories based on their fertility in generating habitable sectors. Finally, this work makes a specific, falsifiable prediction: there will never be a successful, purely mathematical derivation of the Standard Model parameters.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coleman's Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the absence of gravity, Coleman's theorem states that the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton solution, which is regular at the origin and exponentially decays at infinity, gives the lowest action. Perturbatively, this implies that any small deformation from $O(4)$-symmetry gives a larger action. In this letter we investigate the possibility of extending this theorem to the situation where the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton is singular, provided that the action is finite. In particular, we show a general form of the potential around the origin, which realizes a singular instanton with finite action. We then discuss a concrete example in which this situation is realized, and analyze non-trivial anisotropic deformations around the solution perturbatively. Intriguingly, in contrast to the case of Coleman's instantons, we find that there exists a deformed solution that has the same action as the one for the $O(4)$-symmetric solution up to the second order in perturbation. Our result implies that there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons, and gives rise to the possibility of the existence of a non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton with a lower action.</description>

      <title>Reformulation and Extension of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a classically equivalent reformulation of the Standard Model. In this framework, the Higgs doublet is recast as a $2\times2$ matrix and right-handed fermion singlets are organized into novel doublets. This restructuring reveals a latent algebraic geometry that naturally realizes a new local gauge principle: the \textbf{extended Weyl symmetry}. Generalizing Hermann Weyl's 1929 idea of local scale invariance to internal multiplet spaces, this symmetry extends the scope of local gauge symmetries beyond the conventional Yang--Mills framework and provides the foundation for a classical extension of the Standard Model. The resulting theory introduces new gauge bosons (potential dark matter candidates) and a second scalar field. Weyl symmetry breaking renders this additional scalar non-dynamical and leaves the observed Higgs boson as the sole dynamical scalar. The extended Weyl symmetry also leads to several notable theoretical consequences: (i) parity violation is embedded within an underlying parity-symmetric structure; (ii) the minus sign of the Higgs potential is uniquely fixed by the symmetry breaking pattern rather than chosen \textit{by hand}; and (iii) a right-handed neutrino is required by the doublet structure, with its masslessness protected by the extended Weyl symmetry. Quantum aspects of this framework -- particularly potential gauge anomalies and renormalizability -- remain open and warrant dedicated investigation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>

      <title>Perturbative soft graviton theorems in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider soft graviton scattering for a theory where Einstein's gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant, i.e. in a background de Sitter space. Employing a perturbative expansion in a small cosmological constant, we compute leading, subleading and sub-subleading corrections to Weinberg's soft graviton amplitude for the tree-level scatterings in the static patch of de Sitter space. We observe similar universal features of the soft graviton amplitude as found in [JHEP10(2023)055] for the soft photons.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Relativistic Multispecies Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of relativistic plasmas traditionally focus on the dynamics of two-species mixtures of charged particles under the influence of external magnetic fields and those generated by particle currents. However, the extreme conditions of astrophysical plasmas near compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars are often characterized by mixtures of electrons, protons, and positrons, whose dynamics can differ significantly because of the considerable mass contrast. We present the first two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection in a three-species plasma, varying the relative abundance of electrons, protons, and positrons while employing realistic mass ratios to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We find that turbulence leads to the formation of magnetic islands, current sheets, and plasmoids. Reconnection occurs between these structures, with plasma composition playing a key role in determining the number of reconnection sites and their energy-conversion efficiency. In particular, as the proton fraction increases, very small-scale features of the turbulence are washed out, while global dissipative effects are amplified. Finally, using a novel generalization of Ohm's law for a relativistic multi-species plasma, we find that the reconnection rate is primarily governed by the electric fields associated to the divergence of the positron and electron pressure tensors. These results provide new insights into dissipation and particle acceleration in turbulent relativistic plasmas, such as those near black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to interpret their high-energy emission and phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state w_X(z) as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at {z_i}={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33}, and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1\sigma for $\rho_X(z)$ &amp; ~ 2$\sigma$ for w_X(z) at z=2/3. We also find that measuring {$\rho_X(z_i)$} is preferred to measuring {w_X(z_i)} by model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as well as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Varying the choice of redshift values of the $\rho_X(z)$ measurements leads to very consistent results, with AIC/BIC slightly favoring the case of our fiducial {z_i} with z=4/3 omitted. We find agreement with a cosmological constant except for the 1-2$\sigma$ deviation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, where DESI DR2 BAO measurements deviate from a cosmological constant at similar statistical significance. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

      <title>The thermal backreaction of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime should feel explicit thermal effects associated with its curvature. Starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum and a scalar field with small mass compared to the de Sitter curvature, we use the thermo-field dynamics formalism in order to expose these thermal effects. We compute the thermal Wightman function connecting two spacetime points and from it, via the point-splitting regularization technique, the renormalized thermal energy-momentum tensor. We then examine how these corrections affect the de Sitter geometry by solving for the semi-classical backreaction and find that their sign depends on the initial conditions. In order to place our results in context, we compare them to the corresponding 2-loop quantum gravity correction to the cosmological constant derived in [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectra of general non-minimal second-order operators. To do this, we derive the local part of the trace of the second Seeley-DeWitt heat kernel coefficient for such operators in a completely model-independent way. Afterwards, we provide three examples to show how our result can be applied in practical scenarios. In particular, we emphasize this discussion when dealing with a toy-model of dynamical torsion, which is viewed as a simple instance of higher-spin fields. All our results are compatible with the literature, and we provide a Mathematica notebook with the model-independent results that are written in the paper.</description>

      <title>From Wide Triples to UCXBs: Multimessenger Signatures of Dynamically-formed Black Hole-White Dwarf Systems in the LISA Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a subclass of low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by tight orbits and degenerate donors, which pose significant challenges to our understanding of their formation. Recent discoveries of black hole (BH) candidates with main-sequence (MS) or red giant (RG) companions suggest that BH-white dwarf (BH-WD) binaries are common in the Galactic field. Motivated by these observations and the fact that most massive stars are born in triples, we show that wide BH-WD systems can naturally form UCXBs through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Notably, EKL-driven eccentricity excitations combined with gravitational wave (GW) emission and WD dynamical tides can effectively shrink and circularize the orbit, leading to mass-transferring BH-WD binaries. These systems represent promising multimessenger sources in both X-ray and GW observations. Specifically, we predict that the wide triple channel can produce $\sim3-27$ ($\sim1-5$) detectable UCXBs in the Milky Way (Andromeda galaxy), including $\sim1$ system observable by the mHz GW detection of LISA. If the final WD mass can reach sufficiently small values, this channel could contribute up to $\sim 10^3$ UCXBs in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the identification of tertiary companions in observed UCXBs would provide direct evidence for this formation pathway and yield unique insights into their dynamical origins.</description>

      <title>Contextuality from the vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, describes systems in which the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, in contrast to classical hidden-variable descriptions. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that localized interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results show that contextuality is a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum and establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>Bounding field excursions along null geodesics with applications to cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields in theories of gravity often inhabit a moduli space of vacua, and coherent spatial or temporal variations in their expectation values can produce measurable gravitational effects. Such variations are expected in contexts ranging from inflationary cosmology to the near-horizon regions of near-extremal black holes, where they can deflect light rays and shift horizons. This work derives a quantitative field excursion bound (FEB) on scalar variations along null geodesics, expressed in terms of the expansion parameter. The bound follows from the Raychaudhuri equation, assuming that all other fields satisfy the null energy condition (NEC). It is saturated in certain spacetimes containing a timelike naked singularity. A possible generalization to semiclassical spacetimes that violate the NEC, but satisfy a strengthened version of the quantum focusing condition (QFC), is proposed. In cosmology, the FEB constrains the extent of large field excursions to be linearly bounded by the number of e-folds, independent of the inflationary model. This has notable implications for anthropic scenarios, where large excursions are often invoked to access favorable vacua.</description>

      <title>Kosmic Field Theories: Towards Holographic Duals for Unitary String Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on cosmological amplitudes has established reality conditions (derived from unitarity) for general particle-creation processes in flat FLRW cosmologies, in the Bunch-Davies wavefunction. In light of these results, we propose a new class of large-$N$ holographic gauge theories with $d$ spatial dimensions, which we call Kosmic Field Theories (KFTs), of which only a subset are conformal (KCFTs). By imposing an appropriate -- $d$ dependent -- complex phase for the number of colours $N$ and the t' Hooft coupling $\lambda$, we show that the complex phases of $n$-point functions in a KFT match the reality conditions required by $d + 1$ bulk unitarity, to all orders in bulk and boundary perturbation theory, including loop diagrams. Since $N^2/\lambda$ is imaginary in all dimensions, the class of (parity-even) KFTs has no overlap with the class of Wick rotations of unitary QFTs. We also make a preliminary investigation of positivity conditions, which might constrain the overall $\pm$ sign of $N^2$ and $\lambda$.
  Although SU($N$) models with adjoint matter can be defined in generic real dimensions $d$, several features of the class of KFTs are nicer when $d$ is odd, allowing $N^2$ to be real. This includes the possibility of non-oriented and/or open string duals, reality of the effective number of degrees of freedom, and closure under RG flow beyond the leading order in a $1/N$ expansion. This could explain why we live in a cosmology with an even number of spacetime dimensions.</description>
