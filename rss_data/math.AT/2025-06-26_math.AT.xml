      <title>An isovariant Blakers--Massey theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isovariant map is an equivariant map between $G$-spaces which strictly preserves isotropy groups. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for the study of isovariant stable homotopy theory. We prove an isovariant Blakers--Massey theorem and its $n$-cubical generalization, define a suitable notion of suspension (by a trivial representation sphere) in the isovariant category, and prove an isovariant Freudenthal suspension theorem.</description>

      <title>Modular fixed points in equivariant homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the derived $\infty$-category of permutation modules is equivalent to the category of modules over the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum associated to a constant Mackey functor in the $\infty$-category of equivariant spectra. On such module categories we define a modular fixed point functor using geometric fixed points followed by an extension of scalars and identify it with the modular fixed point functor on derived permutation modules introduced by Balmer-Gallauer. As an application, we show that the Picard group of such a module category for a $p$-group is given by the group of class functions satisfying the Borel-Smith conditions. In the language of representation theory, this result was first obtained by Miller.</description>

      <title>Chern Classes of Toric Variety Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve a conjecture of Khovanskii-Monin on the Chern classes of toric variety bundles. The main result is a formula for the total Chern class of the tangent bundle of a toric variety bundle in terms of the total Chern class of the base and the total Chern class of the toric fibre. The result serves as a simultaneous generalization of the description of the total Chern class of a projectivized vector bundle and of the formula for the total Chern class of a toric variety in terms of the Chern classes of the toric divisors. We also establish a topological version of this statement for stably complex quasitoric manifolds. As an immediate application, we obtain a formula for the total Chern class of a toroidal horospherical variety in terms of the Chern classes of the generalized flag variety and the total Chern class of the toric fibre, as well as a new proof of Masuda's formula for equivariant Chern classes.</description>

      <title>On preservation of relative resolutions for poset representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of Galois connections (i.e., adjoint pairs between posets) is ubiquitous in mathematics. In representation theory, it is interesting because it naturally induces the adjoint quadruple between the categories of persistence modules (representations) of the posets via Kan extensions. One of central subjects in multiparameter persistent homology analysis is to understand structures of persistence modules. In this paper, we mainly study a class of Galois connections whose left adjoint is the canonical inclusion of a full subposet. We refer to such a subposet as an interior system, with its corresponding right adjoint given by the floor function. In the induced adjoint quadruple, we call the left Kan extension along its floor function the contraction functor. From its construction, it is left adjoint to the induction functor. Under this setting, we firstly prove that this adjoint pair gives an adjoint pair between finitely presentable persistence modules. Moreover, we introduce a special class of interior systems called aligned interior systems, and prove that both induction and contraction functors over them preserve interval-decomposability of modules. Then, we use them to analyze interval covers and resolutions. We also compute interval resolution global dimensions for certain classes of finite posets.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Landscape and Erosion Distances for Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes connections between three of the most prominent metrics used in the analysis of persistence diagrams in topological data analysis: the bottleneck distance, Patel's erosion distance, and Bubenik's landscape distance. Our main result shows that the erosion and landscape distances are equal, thereby bridging the former's natural category-theoretic interpretation with the latter's computationally convenient structure. The proof utilizes the category with a flow framework of de Silva et al., and leads to additional insights into the structure of persistence landscapes. Our equivalence result is applied to prove several results on the geometry of the erosion distance. We show that the erosion distance is not a length metric, and that its intrinsic metric is the bottleneck distance. We also show that the erosion distance does not coarsely embed into any Hilbert space, even when restricted to persistence diagrams arising from degree-0 persistent homology. Moreover, we show that erosion distance agrees with bottleneck distance on this subspace, so that our non-embeddability theorem generalizes several results in the recent literature.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of global representations for families of bounded rank and VI-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global representation is a compatible collection of representations of the outer automorphism groups of the finite groups belonging to a family $\mathscr{U}$. These arise in classical representation theory, in the study of representation stability, as well as in global homotopy theory. In this paper we begin a systematic study of the derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U};k)$ of global representations over fields $k$ of characteristic zero, from the point-of-view of tensor-triangular geometry. We calculate its Balmer spectrum for various infinite families of finite groups including elementary abelian $p$-groups, cyclic groups, and finite abelian $p$-groups of bounded rank. We then deduce that the Balmer spectrum associated to the family of finite abelian $p$-groups has infinite Krull dimension and infinite Cantor--Bendixson rank, illustrating the complex phenomena we encounter. As a concrete application, we provide a complete tt-theoretic classification of finitely generated derived VI-modules. Our proofs rely on subtle information about the growth behaviour of global representations studied in a companion paper, as well as novel methods from non-rigid tt-geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some properties of the closure operator in the Mac\'ias topology on infinite integral domains. Moreover, under certain conditions, we present topological proofs of the infiniteness of maximal ideals and non-associated irreducible elements, taking advantage of the hyperconnectedness of the Mac\'ias topology. Additionally, some problems are proposed.</description>

      <title>Shadows are Bicategorical Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.02144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hochschild homology has proved to be an important invariant in algebra and homotopy theory, in particular due to its relevance in algebraic $K$-theory and fixed point theory, leading to the development of numerous variants of the original construction. Ponto introduced a bicategorical axiomatization of Hochschild homology-type invariants, called a shadow, which captures the essential common properties of all known variants of Hochschild homology, such as Morita invariance.
  In this paper we clarify the relationship between shadows and Hochschild homology. After extending the notion of Hochschild homology to bicategories in a natural manner, we prove the existence of a universal shadow on any bicategory $\mathscr{B}$, taking values in the Hochschild homology of $\mathscr{B}$, through which all other shadows on $\mathscr{B}$ factor. Shadows are thus co-represented by a bicategorical version of Hochschild homology. Using the universal shadow on the free adjunction bicategory, we can then establish a universal Morita invariance theorem, of which all known cases are immediate corollaries.
  Building on this understanding of shadows on bicategories, we propose an $\infty$-categorical generalization of shadows as functors out of Hochschild homology of an $(\infty,2)$-category in the sense of Berman. As a first step towards constructing relevant examples of $\infty$-categorical shadows, we define the Hochschild homology of enriched $\infty$-categorical bimodules and prove that they assemble into a shadow.
  As part of this work we compute the Hochschild homology of several important $2$-categories (such as the free adjunction), which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Hodge Theory for Entanglement Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>
