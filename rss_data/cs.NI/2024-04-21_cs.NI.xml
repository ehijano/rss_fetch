      <title>Fresh Caching of Dynamic Contents using Restless Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic content caching framework; contents are getting updated at the central server, and a subset of contents are cached at the local cache associated with a Base station (BS). When a request comes, based on whether the content is in the local cache, the BS can decide whether to fetch the content from the central server or serve the cached version from the local cache. Fetching a content incurs a fixed fetching cost, and serving the cached version incurs ageing cost, proportional to the age-of-version (AoV) of the content. AoV is a freshness metric that counts the number of updates at the central server since the content is being fetched. We aim to minimize the average costs (fetching cost and ageing cost) subject to cache capacity constraints. This cost minimization problem is a continuous time restless multiarmed bandit process (RMAB). The single content problem of the corresponding RMAB is a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) since the BS can only see the AoV of the cached contents if it fetches the content. We reformulate the POMDP as a semi-Markov decision process and provide a Whittle index based solution to this problem. Finally, we compare the performance with recent work and show that our proposed policy is optimal via simulations.</description>

      <title>Planning and Operation of Millimeter-wave Downlink Systems with Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates downlink radio resource management (RRM) in millimeter-wave systems with codebook-based hybrid beamforming in a single cell. We consider a practical but often overlooked multi-channel scenario where the base station is equipped with fewer radio frequency chains than there are user equipment (UEs) in the cell. In this case, analog beam selection is important because not all beams preferred by UEs can be selected simultaneously, and since the beam selection cannot vary across subchannels in a time slot, this creates a coupling between subchannels within a time slot. None of the solutions proposed in the literature deal with this important constraint. The paper begins with an offline study that analyzes the impact of different RRM procedures and system parameters on performance. An offline joint RRM optimization problem is formulated and solved that includes beam set selection, UE set selection, power distribution, modulation and coding scheme selection, and digital beamforming as a part of hybrid beamforming. The evaluation results of the offline study provide valuable insights that shows the importance of not neglecting the constraint and guide the design of low-complexity and high-performance online downlink RRM schemes in the second part of the paper. The proposed online RRM algorithms perform close to the performance targets obtained from the offline study while offering acceptable runtime.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Bluetooth Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, indoor localization has received extensive research interest due to more and more applications' needs for location information to provide a more precise and effective service [1], [2]. There are various wireless techniques and mechanisms that have been proposed; some of them have been studied in depth and come into use, such as Wi-Fi, RFID, and sensor networks. In comparison, the development of Bluetooth location technology is slow and there are not many papers and surveys in this field, although the performance and market value of Bluetooth are increasing steadily. In this paper, we aim to provide a detailed survey of various indoor localization systems with Bluetooth. In contrast with the existing surveys, we categorize the exciting localization techniques that have been proposed in the literature in order to sketch the development of Bluetooth location compared to other technologies. We also evaluate different systems from the perspective of availability, cost, scalability, and accuracy. We also discuss remaining problems and challenges to accurate Bluetooth localization.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Offloading Optimization in MEC and Vehicular-Fog Systems: A Distributed-TD3 Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 5G networks has enabled the deployment of a two-tier edge and vehicular-fog network. It comprises Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and Vehicular-Fogs (VFs), strategically positioned closer to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, reducing propagation latency compared to cloud-based solutions and ensuring satisfactory quality of service (QoS). However, during high-traffic events like concerts or athletic contests, MEC sites may face congestion and become overloaded. Utilizing offloading techniques, we can transfer computationally intensive tasks from resource-constrained devices to those with sufficient capacity, for accelerating tasks and extending device battery life. In this research, we consider offloading within a two-tier MEC and VF architecture, involving offloading from MEC to MEC and from MEC to VF. The primary objective is to minimize the average system cost, considering both latency and energy consumption. To achieve this goal, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem aimed at minimizing latency and energy while considering given resource constraints. To facilitate decision-making for nearly optimal computational offloading, we design an equivalent reinforcement learning environment that accurately represents the network architecture and the formulated problem. To accomplish this, we propose a Distributed-TD3 (DTD3) approach, which builds on the TD3 algorithm. Extensive simulations, demonstrate that our strategy achieves faster convergence and higher efficiency compared to other benchmark solutions.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Understand Computer Networks? Towards a Virtual System Administrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence, and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising prospects for aiding system administrators in managing the complexity of modern networks. However, despite this potential, a significant gap exists in the literature regarding the extent to which LLMs can understand computer networks. Without empirical evidence, system administrators might rely on these models without assurance of their efficacy in performing network-related tasks accurately.
  In this paper, we are the first to conduct an exhaustive study on LLMs' comprehension of computer networks. We formulate several research questions to determine whether LLMs can provide correct answers when supplied with a network topology and questions on it. To assess them, we developed a thorough framework for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in various network-related tasks. We evaluate our framework on multiple computer networks employing private (e.g., GPT4) and open-source (e.g., Llama2) models. Our findings demonstrate promising results, with the best model achieving an average accuracy of 79.3%. Private LLMs achieve noteworthy results in small and medium networks, while challenges persist in comprehending complex network topologies, particularly for open-source models. Moreover, we provide insight into how prompt engineering can enhance the accuracy of some tasks.</description>

      <title>Energy Conserved Failure Detection for NS-IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, network slicing (NS) technology has gained widespread adoption within Internet of Things (IoT) systems to meet diverse customized requirements. In the NS based IoT systems, the detection of equipment failures necessitates comprehensive equipment monitoring, which leads to significant resource utilization, particularly within large-scale IoT ecosystems. Thus, the imperative task of reducing failure rates while optimizing monitoring costs has emerged. In this paper, we propose a monitor application function (MAF) based dynamic dormancy monitoring mechanism for the novel NS-IoT system, which is based on a network data analysis function (NWDAF) framework defined in Rel-17. Within the NS-IoT system, all nodes are organized into groups, and multiple MAFs are deployed to monitor each group of nodes. We also propose a dormancy monitor mechanism to mitigate the monitoring energy consumption by placing the MAFs, which is monitoring non-failure devices, in a dormant state. We propose a reinforcement learning based PPO algorithm to guide the dynamic dormancy of MAFs. Simulation results demonstrate that our dynamic dormancy strategy maximizes energy conservation, while proposed algorithm outperforms alternatives in terms of efficiency and stability.</description>

      <title>DeviceRadar: Online IoT Device Fingerprinting in ISPs using Programmable Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device fingerprinting can be used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to identify vulnerable IoT devices for early prevention of threats. However, due to the wide deployment of middleboxes in ISP networks, some important data, e.g., 5-tuples and flow statistics, are often obscured, rendering many existing approaches invalid. It is further challenged by the high-speed traffic of hundreds of terabytes per day in ISP networks. This paper proposes DeviceRadar, an online IoT device fingerprinting framework that achieves accurate, real-time processing in ISPs using programmable switches. We innovatively exploit "key packets" as a basis of fingerprints only using packet sizes and directions, which appear periodically while exhibiting differences across different IoT devices. To utilize them, we propose a packet size embedding model to discover the spatial relationships between packets. Meanwhile, we design an algorithm to extract the "key packets" of each device, and propose an approach that jointly considers the spatial relationships and the key packets to produce a neighboring key packet distribution, which can serve as a feature vector for machine learning models for inference. Last, we design a model transformation method and a feature extraction process to deploy the model on a programmable data plane within its constrained arithmetic operations and memory to achieve line-speed processing. Our experiments show that DeviceRadar can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across 77 IoT devices with 40 Gbps throughput, and requires only 1.3% of the processing time compared to GPU-accelerated approaches.</description>

      <title>Open Datasets for AI-Enabled Radio Resource Control in Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By effectively implementing the strategies for resource allocation, the capabilities, and reliability of non-terrestrial networks (NTN) can be enhanced. This leads to enhance spectrum utilization performance while minimizing the unmet system capacity, meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements and overall system optimization. In turn, a wide range of applications and services in various domains can be supported. However, allocating resources in a multi-constellation system with heterogeneous satellite links and highly dynamic user traffic demand pose challenges in ensuring sufficient and fair resource distribution. To mitigate these complexities and minimize the overhead, there is a growing shift towards utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for its ability to handle such problems effectively. This calls for the development of an intelligent decision-making controller using AI to efficiently manage resources in this complex environment. In this context, real-world open datasets play a pivotal role in the development of AI models addressing radio control optimization problems. As a matter of fact, acquiring suitable datasets can be arduous. Therefore, this paper identifies pertinent real-world open datasets representing realistic traffic pattern, network performances and demand for fixed and dynamic user terminals, enabling a variety of uses cases. The aim of gathering and publishing the information of these datasets are to inspire and assist the research community in crafting the advance resource management solutions. In a nutshell, this paper establishes a solid foundation of commercially accessible data, with the potential to set benchmarks and accelerate the resolution of resource allocation optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Push Wireless Access with Pull Communication for Content-based Wake-up Radios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers energy-efficient connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a coexistence scenario between two distinctive communication models: pull- and push-based. In pull-based, the base station (BS) decides when to retrieve a specific type of data from the IoT devices, while in push-based, the IoT device decides when and which data to transmit. To this end, this paper advocates introducing the content-based wake-up (CoWu), which enables the BS to remotely activate only a subset of pull-based nodes equipped with wake-up receivers, observing the relevant data. In this setup, a BS pulls data with CoWu at a specific time instance to fulfill its tasks while collecting data from the nodes operating with a push-based communication model. The resource allocation plays an important role: longer data collection duration for pull-based nodes can lead to high retrieval accuracy while decreasing the probability of data transmission success for push-based nodes, and vice versa. Numerical results show that CoWu can manage communication requirements for both pull-based and push-based nodes while realizing the high energy efficiency (up to 38%) of IoT devices, compared to the baseline scheduling method.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Networking: Workflow, Advances and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The networking field is characterized by its high complexity and rapid iteration, requiring extensive expertise to accomplish network tasks, ranging from network design, diagnosis, configuration and security. The inherent complexity of these tasks, coupled with the ever-changing landscape of networking technologies and protocols, poses significant hurdles for traditional machine learning-based methods. These methods often struggle to generalize and automate complex tasks in networking, as they require extensive labeled data, domain-specific feature engineering, and frequent retraining to adapt to new scenarios. However, the recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a new wave of possibilities in addressing these challenges. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning. These models, trained on extensive data, can benefit the networking domain. Some efforts have already explored the application of LLMs in the networking domain and revealed promising results. By reviewing recent advances, we present an abstract workflow to describe the fundamental process involved in applying LLM for Networking. We introduce the highlights of existing works by category and explain in detail how they operate at different stages of the workflow. Furthermore, we delve into the challenges encountered, discuss potential solutions, and outline future research prospects. We hope that this survey will provide insight for researchers and practitioners, promoting the development of this interdisciplinary research field.</description>

      <title>FlagVNE: A Flexible and Generalizable Reinforcement Learning Framework for Network Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual network embedding (VNE) is an essential resource allocation task in network virtualization, aiming to map virtual network requests (VNRs) onto physical infrastructure. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution to this problem. However, existing RL-based VNE methods are limited by the unidirectional action design and one-size-fits-all training strategy, resulting in restricted searchability and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a FLexible And Generalizable RL framework for VNE, named FlagVNE. Specifically, we design a bidirectional action-based Markov decision process model that enables the joint selection of virtual and physical nodes, thus improving the exploration flexibility of solution space. To tackle the expansive and dynamic action space, we design a hierarchical decoder to generate adaptive action probability distributions and ensure high training efficiency. Furthermore, to overcome the generalization issue for varying VNR sizes, we propose a meta-RL-based training method with a curriculum scheduling strategy, facilitating specialized policy training for each VNR size. Finally, extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of FlagVNE across multiple key metrics. Our code is available at GitHub (https://github.com/GeminiLight/flag-vne).</description>

      <title>Meta Distribution of Passive Electromagnetic Field Exposure in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the meta distribution of electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE) experienced by a passive user in a cellular network implementing dynamic beamforming. The meta distribution serves as a valuable tool for extracting fine-grained insights into statistics of individual passive user EMFE across the network. A comprehensive stochastic geometry framework is established for this analysis. Given the pivotal role of accurately modeling the main and side lobes of antennas in this context, a multi-cosine gain model is introduced. The meta distribution is closely approximated by a beta distribution derived from its first- and second-order moments, which is demonstrated to be mathematically tractable. The impact of the number of antennas in the ULA on the meta distribution is explored, shedding light on its sensitivity to this parameter.</description>

      <title>Proactive Service Assurance in 5G and B5G Networks: A Closed-Loop Algorithm for End-to-End Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The customization of services in Fifth-generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) networks relies heavily on network slicing, which creates multiple virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure, tailored to meet specific requirements of distinct applications, using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). It is imperative to ensure that network services meet the performance and reliability requirements of various applications and users, thus, service assurance is one of the critical components in network slicing. One of the key functionalities of network slicing is the ability to scale Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in response to changing resource demand and to meet Customer Service Level agreements (SLAs).
  In this paper, we introduce a proactive closed-loop algorithm for end-to-end network orchestration, designed to provide service assurance in 5G and B5G networks. We focus on dynamically scaling resources to meet key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to each network slice and operate in parallel across multiple slices, making it scalable and capable of managing completely automatically real-time service assurance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively fulfills service assurance requirements for different network slice types, thereby minimizing network resource utilization and reducing the over-provisioning of spare resources.</description>

      <title>Optimal Flow Admission Control in Edge Computing via Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the uptake of intelligent data-driven applications, edge computing infrastructures necessitate a new generation of admission control algorithms to maximize system performance under limited and highly heterogeneous resources. In this paper, we study how to optimally select information flows which belong to different classes and dispatch them to multiple edge servers where deployed applications perform flow analytic tasks. The optimal policy is obtained via constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) theory accounting for the demand of each edge application for specific classes of flows, the constraints on computing capacity of edge servers and of the access network.
  We develop DR-CPO, a specialized primal-dual Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) method which solves the resulting optimal admission control problem by reward decomposition. DR-CPO operates optimal decentralized control and mitigates effectively state-space explosion while preserving optimality. Compared to existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions, extensive results show that DR-CPO achieves 15\% higher reward on a wide variety of environments, while requiring on average only 50\% of the amount of learning episodes to converge. Finally, we show how to match DR-CPO and load-balancing to dispatch optimally information streams to available edge servers and further improve system performance.</description>

      <title>EMF Exposure Mitigation via MAC Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: International standards bodies define Electromagnetic field (EMF) emission requirements that can be translated into control of the base station actual Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), i.e., averaged over a sliding time window. In this work we show how to comply with such requirements by designing a water-filling power allocation method operating at the MAC scheduler level. Our method ensures throughput fairness across users while constraining the EIRP to a value that is produced by an outer-loop procedure which is not the focus of our paper. The low computational complexity of our technique is appealing given the tight computational requirements of the MAC scheduler. Our proposal is evaluated against the prior art approaches through massive-MIMO system level simulations that include realistic modeling of physical and MAC level cellular procedures. We conclude that our proposal effectively mitigates EMF exposure with considerably less impact on network performance, making it a standout candidate for 5G and future 6G MAC scheduler implementations.</description>

      <title>Moonshot: Optimizing Chain-Based Rotating Leader BFT via Optimistic Proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing chain-based rotating-leader BFT SMR protocols for the partially synchronous network model with constant commit latencies incur block periods of at least $2\delta$ (where $\delta$ is the message transmission latency). While a protocol with a block period of $\delta$ exists under the synchronous model, its commit latency is linear in the size of the system.
  To close this gap, we present the first chain-based BFT SMR protocols with $\delta$ delay between the proposals of consecutive honest leaders and commit latencies of $3\delta$. We present three protocols for the partially synchronous model under different notions of optimistic responsiveness, two of which implement pipelining. All of our protocols achieve reorg resilience and two have short view lengths; properties that many existing chain-based BFT SMR protocols lack. We present an evaluation of our protocols in a wide-area network wherein they demonstrate significant increases in throughput and reductions in latency compared to the state-of-the-art, Jolteon. Our results also demonstrate that techniques commonly employed to reduce communication complexity$\unicode{x2014}$such as vote-pipelining and the use of designated vote-aggregators$\unicode{x2014}$actually reduce practical performance in many settings.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Proof of Distinct Identity: a Standard-compatible Sybil-resistant Pseudonym Extension for C-ITS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudonyms are widely used in Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) to protect the location privacy of vehicles. However, the unlinkability nature of pseudonyms also enables Sybil attacks, where a malicious vehicle can pretend to be multiple vehicles at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol called zero-knowledge Proof of Distinct Identity (zk-PoDI,) which allows a vehicle to prove that it is not the owner of another pseudonym in the local area, without revealing its actual identity. Zk-PoDI is based on the Diophantine equation and zk-SNARK, and does not rely on any specific pseudonym design or infrastructure assistance. We show that zk-PoDI satisfies all the requirements for a practical Sybil-resistance pseudonym system, and it has low latency, adjustable difficulty, moderate computation overhead, and negligible communication cost. We also discuss the future work of implementing and evaluating zk-PoDI in a realistic city-scale simulation environment.</description>
