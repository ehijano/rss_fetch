      <title>A Shared-Aperture Dual-Band sub-6 GHz and mmWave Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface With Independent Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel dual-band reconfigurable intelligent surface (DBI-RIS) design that combines the functionalities of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-6 GHz bands within a single aperture is proposed. This design aims to bridge the gap between current single-band reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and wireless systems utilizing sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands that require RIS with independently reconfigurable dual-band operation. The mmWave element is realized by a double-layer patch antenna loaded with 1-bit phase shifters, providing two reconfigurable states. An 8x8 mmWave element array is selectively interconnected using three RF switches to form a reconfigurable sub-6 GHz element at 3.5 GHz. A suspended electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structure is proposed to suppress surface waves and ensure sufficient geometric space for the phase shifter and control networks in the mmWave element. A low-cost planar spiral inductor (PSI) is carefully optimized to connect mmWave elements, enabling the sub-6 GHz function without affecting mmWave operation. Finally, prototypes of the DBI-RIS are fabricated, and experimental verification is conducted using two separate measurement testbeds. The fabricated sub-6 GHz RIS successfully achieves beam steering within the range of -35 to 35 degrees for DBI-RIS with 4x4 sub-6 GHz elements, while the mmWave RIS demonstrates beam steering between -30 to 30 degrees for DBI-RIS with 8x8 mmWave elements, and have good agreement with simulation results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to solve the problems such as difficult to extract effective features and low accuracy of sales volume prediction caused by complex relationships such as market sales volume in time series prediction, we proposed a time series prediction method of market sales volume based on Sequential General VMD and spatial smoothing Long short-term memory neural network (SS-LSTM) combination model. Firstly, the spatial smoothing algorithm is used to decompose and calculate the sample data of related industry sectors affected by the linkage effect of market sectors, extracting modal features containing information via Sequential General VMD on overall market and specific price trends; Then, according to the background of different Market data sets, LSTM network is used to model and predict the price of fundamental data and modal characteristics. The experimental results of data prediction with seasonal and periodic trends show that this method can achieve higher price prediction accuracy and more accurate accuracy in specific market contexts compared to traditional prediction methods Describe the changes in market sales volume.</description>

      <title>A Combination Model Based on Sequential General Variational Mode Decomposition Method for Time Series Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial time series is a key concern for market economy makers and investors. The article selects online store sales and Australian beer sales as representatives of non-stationary, trending, and seasonal financial time series, and constructs a new SGVMD-ARIMA combination model in a non-linear combination way to predict financial time series. The ARIMA model, LSTM model, and other classic decomposition prediction models are used as control models to compare the accuracy of different models. The empirical results indicate that the constructed combination prediction model has universal advantages over the single prediction model and linear combination prediction model of the control group. Within the prediction interval, our proposed combination model has improved advantages over traditional decomposition prediction control group models.</description>

      <title>The Curse of Beam-Squint in ISAC: Causes, Implications, and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a means to efficiently utilize spectrum and thereby save cost and power. At the higher end of the spectrum, ISAC systems operate at wideband using large antenna arrays to meet the stringent demands for high-resolution sensing and enhanced communications capacity. However, the wideband implementation entails beam-squint, that is, deviations in the generated beam directions because of the narrowband assumption in the analog components. This causes significant degradation in the communications capacity, target detection, and parameter estimation. This article presents the design challenges caused by beam-squint and its mitigation in ISAC systems. In this context, we also discuss several ISAC design perspectives including far-/near-field beamforming, channel/direction estimation, sparse array design, and index modulation. There are also several research opportunities in waveform design, beam training, and array processing to adequately address beam-squint in ISAC.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Optimized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Application to ECG Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A greedy pursuit strategy which finds a common basis for approximating a set of similar signals is proposed. The strategy extends the Optimized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit approach to selecting the subspace containing the approximation of all the signals in the set. The method, called Simultaneous Optimized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, is stepwise optimal in the sense of minimizing at each iteration the mean error norm of the joint approximation. When applied to compression of electrocardiograms, significant gains over other transformation based compression techniques are demonstrated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technologies are at the forefront of enhancing spectrum and energy efficiency in the next generation multi-antenna communication systems. This paper explores a RSMA system with multiple IRSs, and proposes two purpose-driven scheduling schemes, i.e., the exhaustive IRS-aided (EIA) and opportunistic IRS-aided (OIA) schemes. The aim is to optimize the system weighted energy efficiency (EE) under the above two schemes, respectively. Specifically, the Dinkelbach, branch and bound, successive convex approximation, and the semidefinite relaxation methods are exploited within the alternating optimization framework to obtain effective solutions to the considered problems. The numerical findings indicate that the EIA scheme exhibits better performance compared to the OIA scheme in diverse scenarios when considering the weighted EE, and the proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the baseline algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation plays a crucial role in assisting cardiologists with accurate diagnoses. Prior research studies have explored various methods, including the application of deep learning techniques, to achieve precise delineation. However, existing approaches face limitations primarily related to dataset size and robustness. In this paper, we introduce a dataset for ECG delineation and propose a novel self-trained method aimed at leveraging a vast amount of unlabeled ECG data. Our approach involves the pseudolabeling of unlabeled data using a neural network trained on our dataset. Subsequently, we train the model on the newly labeled samples to enhance the quality of delineation. We conduct experiments demonstrating that our dataset is a valuable resource for training robust models and that our proposed self-trained method improves the prediction quality of ECG delineation.</description>

      <title>Lightweight CNN-BiLSTM based Intrusion Detection Systems for Resource-Constrained IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have played a significant role in detecting and preventing cyber-attacks within traditional computing systems. It is not surprising that the same technology is being applied to secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks from cyber threats. The limited computational resources available on IoT devices make it challenging to deploy conventional computing-based IDSs. The IDSs designed for IoT environments must also demonstrate high classification performance, utilize low-complexity models, and be of a small size. Despite significant progress in IoT-based intrusion detection, developing models that both achieve high classification performance and maintain reduced complexity remains challenging. In this study, we propose a hybrid CNN architecture composed of a lightweight CNN and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to enhance the performance of IDS on the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The proposed model is specifically designed to run onboard resource-constrained IoT devices and meet their computation capability requirements. Despite the complexity of designing a model that fits the requirements of IoT devices and achieves higher accuracy, our proposed model outperforms the existing research efforts in the literature by achieving an accuracy of 97.28\% for binary classification and 96.91\% for multiclassification.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic Digital Twin for Anomaly Detection in Floating Offshore Wind Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for condition-based and predictive maintenance is rising across industries, especially for remote, high-value, and high-risk assets. In this article, the diagnostic digital twin concept is introduced, discussed, and implemented for a floating offshore turbine. A diagnostic digital twin is a virtual representation of an asset that combines real-time data and models to monitor damage, detect anomalies, and diagnose failures, thereby enabling condition-based and predictive maintenance. By applying diagnostic digital twins to offshore assets, unexpected failures can be alleviated, but the implementation can prove challenging. Here, a diagnostic digital twin is implemented for an operational floating offshore wind turbine. The asset is monitored through measurements. Unsupervised learning methods are employed to build a normal operation model, detect anomalies, and provide a fault diagnosis. Warnings and diagnoses are sent through text messages, and a more detailed diagnosis can be accessed in a virtual reality interface. The diagnostic digital twin successfully detected an anomaly with high confidence hours before a failure occurred. The paper concludes by discussing diagnostic digital twins in the broader context of offshore engineering. The presented approach can be generalized to other offshore assets to improve maintenance and increase the lifetime, efficiency, and sustainability of offshore assets.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Analysis of CSI Ratio-Based Transmitter Selection with Unreliable Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the secrecy performance of a multi-transmitter system with unreliable backhaul links. To improve secrecy, we propose a novel transmitter selection (TS) scheme that selects a transmitter with the maximum ratio of the destination channel power gain to the eavesdropping channel power gain. The backhaul reliability factor is incorporated with the distribution of the channel power gain through the utilization of a mixture distribution. We evaluate the non-zero secrecy rate (NZR) and the secrecy outage probability (SOP) as well as their asymptotes in two scenarios of backhaul activity knowledge, where it is available and where it is unavailable. The results illustrate that because of the unreliable backhaul, the proposed destination-to-eavesdropper channel power gain ratio-based TS scheme is constrained in terms of secrecy performance. However, performance enhancements are observed when the backhaul knowledge activity is utilized. Furthermore, the proposed scheme outperforms all the sub-optimal TS schemes and achieves nearly optimal performance without requiring noise power or the evaluation of the exact secrecy rate measurement.</description>

      <title>Huygens-Fresnel Model Based Position-Aided Phase Configuration for 1-Bit RIS Assisted Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), composed of nearly passive elements, is regarded as one of the potential paradigms to support multi-gigabit data in real-time. However, in traditional CSI (channel state information) driven frame, the training overhead of channel estimation greatly increases as the number of RIS elements increases to intelligently manipulate the reflected signals. To conveniently use the reflected signal without complex CSI feedback, in this paper we propose a position-aided phase configuration scheme based on the property of Fresnel zone. In particular, we design the impedance based discrete RIS elements with joint absorption mode and reflection mode considering the fabrication complexities, which integrated the property of the Fresnel zone to resist the impact of position error. Then, with joint absorption and 1-bit reflection mode elements, we develop the two-step position-aided ON/OFF states judgement (TPOSJ) scheme and the frame structure to control the ON/OFF state of RIS, followed by analyzing the impacts of mobility and position error on our proposed scheme. Also, we derive the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral theorem based power flow. Simulations show that the proposed scheme can manipulate the ON/OFF state intelligently without complex CSI, thus verifying the practical application of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>A Data and Model-Driven Deep Learning Approach to Robust Downlink Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of the long-standing probabilistically robust transmit beamforming problem with channel uncertainties in the multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink transmission. This problem poses significant analytical and computational challenges. Currently, the state-of-the-art optimization method relies on convex restrictions as tractable approximations to ensure robustness against Gaussian channel uncertainties. However, this method not only exhibits high computational complexity and suffers from the rank relaxation issue but also yields conservative solutions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning-based approach that incorporates the sampling of channel uncertainties in the training process to optimize the probabilistic system performance. We introduce a model-driven learning approach that defines a new beamforming structure with trainable parameters to account for channel uncertainties. Additionally, we employ a graph neural network to efficiently infer the key beamforming parameters. We successfully apply this approach to the minimum rate quantile maximization problem subject to outage and total power constraints. Furthermore, we propose a bisection search method to address the more challenging power minimization problem with probabilistic rate constraints by leveraging the aforementioned approach. Numerical results confirm that our approach achieves non-conservative robust performance, higher data rates, greater power efficiency, and faster execution compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Singing Voice Graph Modeling for SingFake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting singing voice deepfakes, or SingFake, involves determining the authenticity and copyright of a singing voice. Existing models for speech deepfake detection have struggled to adapt to unseen attacks in this unique singing voice domain of human vocalization. To bridge the gap, we present a groundbreaking SingGraph model. The model synergizes the capabilities of the MERT acoustic music understanding model for pitch and rhythm analysis with the wav2vec2.0 model for linguistic analysis of lyrics. Additionally, we advocate for using RawBoost and beat matching techniques grounded in music domain knowledge for singing voice augmentation, thereby enhancing SingFake detection performance. Our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results within the SingFake dataset, surpassing the previous SOTA model across three distinct scenarios: it improves EER relatively for seen singers by 13.2%, for unseen singers by 24.3%, and unseen singers using different codecs by 37.1%.</description>

      <title>CSI-GPT: Integrating Generative Pre-Trained Transformer with Federated-Tuning to Acquire Downlink Massive MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, how to reliably acquire downlink channel state information (CSI) with low overhead is challenging. In this work, by integrating the generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) with federated-tuning, we propose a CSI-GPT approach to realize efficient downlink CSI acquisition. Specifically, we first propose a Swin Transformer-based channel acquisition network (SWTCAN) to acquire downlink CSI, where pilot signals, downlink channel estimation, and uplink CSI feedback are jointly designed. Furthermore, to solve the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a variational auto-encoder-based channel sample generator (VAE-CSG), which can generate sufficient CSI samples based on a limited number of high-quality CSI data obtained from the current cell. The CSI dataset generated from VAE-CSG will be used for pre-training SWTCAN. To fine-tune the pre-trained SWTCAN for improved performance, we propose an online federated-tuning method, where only a small amount of SWTCAN parameters are unfrozen and updated using over-the-air computation, avoiding the high communication overhead caused by aggregating the complete CSI samples from user equipment (UEs) to the BS for centralized fine-tuning. Simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed SWTCAN and the communication efficiency of the proposed federated-tuning method.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a sparse, high-dimensional stationary multivariate Gaussian time series. A sparse-group lasso-based frequency-domain formulation of the problem based on frequency-domain sufficient statistic for the observed time series is presented. We investigate an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach for optimization of the sparse-group lasso penalized log-likelihood. We provide sufficient conditions for convergence in the Frobenius norm of the inverse PSD estimators to the true value, jointly across all frequencies, where the number of frequencies are allowed to increase with sample size. This results also yields a rate of convergence. We also empirically investigate selection of the tuning parameters based on Bayesian information criterion, and illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>A Coordinate Descent Approach to Atomic Norm Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic norm minimization is of great interest in various applications of sparse signal processing including super-resolution line-spectral estimation and signal denoising. In prac-tice, atomic norm minimization (ANM) is formulated as semi-definite programming (SDP) that is generally hard to solve. This work introduces a low-complexity solver for a type of ANM known as atomic norm soft thresholding (AST). The proposed method uses the framework of coordinate descent and exploits the sparsity-inducing nature of atomic-norm regularization. Specifically, this work first provides an equivalent, non-convex formulation of AST. It is then proved that applying a coordinate descent algorithm on the non-convex formulation leads to convergence to the global solution. For the case of a single measurement vector of length N and complex exponential basis, the complexity of each step in the coordinate descent procedure is O(N log N ), rendering the method efficient for large-scale problems. Through simulations, the proposed solver is shown to be faster than alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) or customized interior point SDP solver if the problems are sparse. It is demonstrated that the coordinate descent solver can be modified for AST with multiple dimensions and multiple measurement vectors as well as a variety of general basis.</description>

      <title>Deriving Characteristic Mode Eigenvalue Behavior Using Subduction of Group Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method to derive features of modal eigenvalue traces from known and understood solutions is proposed. It utilizes the concept of subduction from point group theory to obtain the symmetry properties of a target structure from those of a structure with a higher order of symmetry. This is applied exemplary to the analytically known characteristic modes (CMs) of the spherical shell. {The eigenvalue behavior of a cube in free-space is derived from it numerically. In this process, formerly crossing eigenvalue traces are found to split up, forming a macroscopic crossing avoidance (MACA). This finding is used to explain indentations in eigenvalue traces observed for 3-D structures, which are of increasing interest in recent literature. The utility of this knowledge is exemplified through a demonstrator antenna design. Here, the subduction procedure is used to analytically predict the eigenvalues of a cuboid on a perfectly electrically conducting plane. The a priori knowledge about the MACA is used to avoid its negative impact on input matching and the frequency stability of the far-field patterns, by choosing the dimensions of the antenna structure so the MACA is outside the target frequency range.</description>

      <title>Log-FSK: A Frequency Modulation for Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we introduce Logarithmic Frequency Shift Keying (Log-FSK), a novel frequency modulation for over-the-air computation (AirComp). Log-FSK leverages non-linear signal processing to produce AirComp in the frequency domain, this is, the maximum frequency of the received signal corresponds to the sum of the individual transmitted frequencies. The demodulation procedure relies on the inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the extraction of the maximum frequency component. We provide the theoretical performance in terms of error probability and mean squared error. To demonstrate its practicality, we present specific applications and experimental results showcasing the effectiveness of Log-FSK AirComp within linear Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Our experiments show that Log-FSK outperforms linear AirComp, implemented with double sideband (DSB), when working above the threshold SNR.</description>

      <title>High-speed odour sensing using miniaturised electronic nose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animals have evolved to rapidly detect and recognise brief and intermittent encounters with odour packages, exhibiting recognition capabilities within milliseconds. Artificial olfaction has faced challenges in achieving comparable results -- existing solutions are either slow; or bulky, expensive, and power-intensive -- limiting applicability in real-world scenarios for mobile robotics. Here we introduce a miniaturised high-speed electronic nose; characterised by high-bandwidth sensor readouts, tightly controlled sensing parameters and powerful algorithms. The system is evaluated on a high-fidelity odour delivery benchmark. We showcase successful classification of tens-of-millisecond odour pulses, and demonstrate temporal pattern encoding of stimuli switching with up to 60 Hz. Those timescales are unprecedented in miniaturised low-power settings, and demonstrably exceed the performance observed in mice. For the first time, it is possible to match the temporal resolution of animal olfaction in robotic systems. This will allow for addressing challenges in environmental and industrial monitoring, security, neuroscience, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Rao-Blackwellized Particle Smoothing for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the task of building a map representation of an unknown environment while at the same time using it for positioning. A probabilistic interpretation of the SLAM task allows for incorporating prior knowledge and for operation under uncertainty. Contrary to the common practice of computing point estimates of the system states, we capture the full posterior density through approximate Bayesian inference. This dynamic learning task falls under state estimation, where the state-of-the-art is in sequential Monte Carlo methods that tackle the forward filtering problem. In this paper, we introduce a framework for probabilistic SLAM using particle smoothing that does not only incorporate observed data in current state estimates, but it also back-tracks the updated knowledge to correct for past drift and ambiguities in both the map and in the states. Our solution can efficiently handle both dense and sparse map representations by Rao-Blackwellization of conditionally linear and conditionally linearized models. We show through simulations and real-world experiments how the principles apply to radio (BLE/Wi-Fi), magnetic field, and visual SLAM. The proposed solution is general, efficient, and works well under confounding noise.</description>

      <title>Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of deep learning models across diverse tasks, their complexity poses challenges for interpretation. This challenge is particularly evident for audio signals, where conveying interpretations becomes inherently difficult. To address this issue, we introduce Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers (L-MAC), a posthoc interpretation method that generates faithful and listenable interpretations. L-MAC utilizes a decoder on top of a pretrained classifier to generate binary masks that highlight relevant portions of the input audio. We train the decoder with a loss function that maximizes the confidence of the classifier decision on the masked-in portion of the audio while minimizing the probability of model output for the masked-out portion. Quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data demonstrate that L-MAC consistently produces more faithful interpretations than several gradient and masking-based methodologies. Furthermore, a user study confirms that, on average, users prefer the interpretations generated by the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Deepcode, a learned feedback code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have recently been used to construct non-linear codes for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. However, there is limited understanding of how these black-box-like codes with many learned parameters use feedback. This study aims to uncover the fundamental principles underlying the first deep-learned feedback code, known as Deepcode, which is based on an RNN architecture. Our interpretable model based on Deepcode is built by analyzing the influence length of inputs and approximating the non-linear dynamics of the original black-box RNN encoder. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our interpretable model -- which includes both an encoder and a decoder -- achieves comparable performance to Deepcode while offering an interpretation of how it employs feedback for error correction.</description>

      <title>Random matrix theory improved Fr\'echet mean of symmetric positive definite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider the realm of covariance matrices in machine learning, particularly focusing on computing Fr\'echet means on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, commonly referred to as Karcher or geometric means. Such means are leveraged in numerous machine-learning tasks. Relying on advanced statistical tools, we introduce a random matrix theory-based method that estimates Fr\'echet means, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with low sample support and a high number of matrices to average. Our experimental evaluation, involving both synthetic and real-world EEG and hyperspectral datasets, shows that we largely outperform state-of-the-art methods.</description>
