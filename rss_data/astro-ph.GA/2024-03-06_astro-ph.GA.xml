      <title>The COS CGM Compendium. V: the dichotomy in the properties of OVI associated with the low- and high-Metallicity HI-bearing gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the OVI content and kinematics for 126 $z &lt; 1$ HI-selected absorbers for which the metallicities of their cool photoionized phase have been determined. We separate the absorbers into 100 strong Lya forest systems (SLFSs with $15 \lesssim$ logN(HI) $&lt; 16.2$) and 26 partial Lyman Limit systems (pLLSs with $16.2 \leq$ logN(HI) $\leq 17.2$). The sample is drawn from the COS CGM Compendium (CCC) of Lehner et al. and has OVI coverage in $S/N \geq 8$ HST/COS G130M/G160M QSO spectra, yielding a $2\sigma$ completeness level of logN(OVI) $\geq 13.6$. There are significant differences in the OVI detection rates between low-metal (LM; [X/H] $\leq -1.4$) SLFSs and high-metal (HM; [X/H] $&gt; -1.4$) SLFSs, $\sim$15\% versus $\sim$60%, respectively. The OVI frequency for the HM and LM pLLSs is, however, similar $\sim$60%. The SLFSs and pLLSs with no OVI are consistent with gas being in a single-phase, while those with OVI trace multiphase gas. We find that the OVI velocity widths and column densities have different distributions in LM and HM gas. We observe a strong correlation between OVI column density and metallicity. The strongest (logN(OVI) $\gtrsim 14$) and broadest OVI absorbers are nearly systematically found to be associated with HM gas, while weaker OVI absorbers are found in both LM and HM HI-bearing gas. From comparisons with galaxy and OVI surveys, we conclude absorbers with logN(OVI) $\gtrsim 14$ most likely arise in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of star-forming galaxies, with the broadest and strongest possibly tracing galaxy outflows. Absorbers with weak OVI most likely trace the extended CGM or intergalactic medium (IGM), while those without OVI in all likelihood originate in the IGM.</description>

      <title>The dark balance: quantifying the inner halo response to active galactic nuclei feedback in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the impact of supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback on dark matter (DM) halos in numerical NIHAO simulations of galaxies. In particular, the amount of DM displaced via active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and the physical scale over which AGN feedback affects the DM halo are quantified by comparing NIHAO simulations with and without AGN feedback. NIHAO galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_{\rm \odot})\geq 10.0$ show a growing central DM suppression of 0.2 dex (~40%) from z = 1.5 to the present relative to noAGN feedback simulations. The growth of the DM suppression is related to the mass evolution of the SMBH and the gas mass in the central regions. For the most massive NIHAO galaxies $\log(M_*/M_{\rm \odot}) &gt; 10.5$, partially affected by numerical resolution, the central DM suppression peaks at z = 0.5, after which halo contraction overpowers AGN feedback due a shortage of gas and, thus, SMBH growth. The spatial scale, or ``sphere of influence,'' over which AGN feedback affects the DM distribution decreases as a function of time for MW-mass galaxies (from ~16 kpc at z = 1.5 to ~7.8 kpc at z = 0) as a result of halo contraction due to stellar growth. For the most massive NIHAO galaxies, the size of the sphere of influence remains constant (~$16 kpc) for z &gt; 0.5 owing to the balance between AGN feedback and halo contraction.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Aligned Striations in the L914 Filamentary Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CO ($J = 1-0$) multi-line observations toward the L914 dark cloud in the vicinity of the Cygnus X region, using the 13.7 m millimeter telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO). The CO observations reveal in the L914 cloud a long filament with an angular length of $\sim 3.\!\!^\circ 6$, corresponding to approximately $\rm 50~pc$ at the measured distance of $\sim\rm 760~pc$. Furthermore, a group of hair-like striations are discovered in the two subregions of the L914 cloud, which are connected with the dense ridge of the filament. These striations display quasi-periodic characteristics in both the CO intensity images and position-velocity diagrams. Two of the striations also show increasing velocity gradients and dispersions toward the dense ridge, which could be fitted by accretion flows under gravity. Based on the $Planck$ 353 GHz dust polarization data, we find that the striations are well aligned with the magnetic fields. Moreover, both the striations and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the dense ridge, which constructs a bimodal configuration. Using the classic method, we estimate the strength of magnetic field, and further evaluate the relative importance of gravity, turbulence and magnetic field, and find that the L914 cloud is strongly magnetized. Our results suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in the formation of filamentary structures by channelling the material along the striations toward the dense ridge. The comparison between the observations and simulations suggests that striations could be a product of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) process.</description>

      <title>No massive black holes in the Milky Way halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way. They may have formed due to the evolution of massive low-metallicity stars, dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments, or density fluctuations in the very early Universe (primordial black holes). If the latter hypothesis is correct, primordial black holes should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the black hole merger rates observed by gravitational wave detectors. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. Here, we present the results of the search for the long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of 78.7 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that were monitored for 20 years (2001-2020) by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year. The properties of all thirteen microlensing events with timescales shorter than one year detected by OGLE toward the LMC can be explained by astrophysical objects located either in the LMC itself or in the Milky Way disk, without the need to invoke dark matter in the form of compact objects. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and compact objects in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. This conclusively rules out primordial black hole mergers as a dominant source of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Lyman Continuum Escape from Low-mass Lensed Galaxies at 1.3 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass galaxies can significantly contribute to reionization due to their potentially high Lyman continuum (LyC) escape fraction and relatively high space density. We present a constraint on the LyC escape fraction from low-mass galaxies at z = 1.3 - 3.0. We obtained rest-frame UV continuum imaging with the ACS/SBC and the WFC3/UVIS from the Hubble Space Telescope for eight strongly-lensed galaxies that were identified in the Sloan Giant Arc Survey (SGAS) and the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). The targeted galaxies were selected to be spectroscopically confirmed, highly magnified, and blue in their UV spectral shapes ($\beta&lt;-1.7$). Our targets include intrinsically low luminosity galaxies down to a magnification-corrected absolute UV magnitude of $M_{\rm UV}\sim-14$. We perform custom-defined aperture photometry to place the most reliable upper limits of LyC escape from our sample. From our observations, we report no significant ($&gt;$$2\sigma$) detections of LyC fluxes, placing 1$\sigma$ upper limits on the absolute LyC escape fractions of 3 - 15%. Our observations do not support the expected increased escape fractions of LyC photons from intrinsically UV faint sources. Considering the highly anisotropic geometry of LyC escape, increasing the sample size of faint galaxies in future LyC observations is crucial.</description>

      <title>Radial and azimuthal gradients of the moving groups in Gaia DR3: The slow/fast bar degeneracy problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of the central bar of the Milky Way are still under debate whilst being fundamental ingredients for the evolution of our Galaxy. The recent Gaia DR3 offers an unprecedented detailed view of the 6D phase-space of the MW. We aim to characterise the dynamical moving groups across the MW disc, and use their large-scale distribution to help constrain the properties of the Galactic bar. We used wavelet transforms of the azimuthal velocity ($V_\phi$) distribution in bins of radial velocity to robustly detect the kinematic substructure in the Gaia DR3 catalogue. We then connected these structures across the disc to measure the azimuthal ($\phi$) and radial ($R$) gradients of the moving groups. We simulated thousands of perturbed distribution functions using Backwards Integration of feasible Galaxy models that include a bar, to compare them with the data and to explore and quantify the degeneracies. The radial gradient of the Hercules moving group ($\partial V_\phi/\partial R$ = 28.1$\pm$2.8 km$\,$s$^{-1}\,$kpc$^{-1}$) cannot be reproduced by our simple models of the Galaxy which show much larger slopes both for a fast and a slow bar. This suggests the need for more complex dynamics (e.g. spiral arms, a slowing bar, external perturbations, etc.). We measure an azimuthal gradient for Hercules of $\partial V_\phi/\partial \phi$ = -0.63$\pm$0.13$\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$deg$^{-1}$ and find that it is compatible with both the slow and fast bar models. Our analysis points out that using this type of analysis at least two moving groups are needed to start breaking the degeneracies. We conclude that it is not sufficient for a model to replicate the local velocity distribution; it must also capture its larger-scale variations. The accurate quantification of the gradients, especially in the azimuthal direction, will be key for the understanding of the dynamics governing the disc. (ABR)</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud based on 20 years of OGLE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) can be used to probe the distribution and mass function of compact objects in the direction toward that galaxy - in the Milky Way disk, Milky Way dark matter halo, and the LMC itself. The previous measurements, based on small statistical samples of events, found that the optical depth is an order of magnitude smaller than that expected from the entire dark matter halo in the form of compact objects. However, these previous studies were not sensitive to long-duration events with Einstein timescales longer than 2.5-3 years, which are expected from massive ($10-100\,M_{\odot}$) and intermediate-mass ($10^2-10^5\,M_{\odot}$) black holes. Such events would have been missed by the previous studies and would not have been taken into account in calculations of the optical depth. Here, we present the analysis of nearly 20-year-long photometric monitoring of 78.7 million stars in the LMC by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 through 2020. We describe the observing setup, the construction of the 20-year OGLE dataset, the methods used for searching for microlensing events in the light curve data, and the calculation of the event detection efficiency. In total, we find 16 microlensing events (thirteen using an automated pipeline and three with manual searches), all of which have timescales shorter than 1 yr. We use a sample of thirteen events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC $\tau=(0.121 \pm 0.037)\times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma=(0.74 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. These numbers are consistent with lensing by stars in the Milky Way disk and the LMC itself, and demonstrate that massive and intermediate-mass black holes cannot comprise a significant fraction of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The true number density of massive galaxies in the early Universe revealed by JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in galaxy formation that has emerged recently is the early assembly of massive galaxies. The observed number density and the maximum stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) of massive galaxies in the early Universe appear to be higher than model predictions, which may pose a serious problem to the LCDM cosmology. A major limitation in many previous studies is the large uncertainty in estimating $M_{\star}$ due to the lack of constraints in the rest-frame near-infrared part of the spectral energy distribution, which is critical to determining $M_{\star}$ accurately. Here we use data from a large JWST/MIRI survey in the PRIMER program to carry out a systematic analysis of massive galaxies at $z \sim 3-8$, leveraging photometric constraints at rest-frame $\gtrsim 1 \mu$m. We find a significant reduction in the number and mass densities of massive galaxies at $z &gt; 5$ compared to earlier results that did not use the MIRI photometry. Within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, our results require a moderate increase in the baryon-to-star conversion efficiency ($\epsilon$) towards higher redshifts and higher $M_{\star}$. For the most massive galaxies at $z\sim 8$, the required $\epsilon$ is $\sim 0.3$, in comparison to $\epsilon \sim 0.14$ for typical low-redshift galaxies. Our findings are consistent with models assuming suppressed stellar feedback due to the high gas density and the associated short free-fall time expected for massive halos at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Giant Biconical Dust Filaments in the Starburst Galaxy NGC 1808</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from an analysis of multi-wavelength archival data on the multi-phase outflow in the starburst galaxy NGC 1808. We report the detection at 70 and 100 um of dust filaments that extend up to ~ 13 kpc from the galactic mid-plane and trace an edge-brightened biconical structure along the minor axis of the galaxy. The inner filaments are roughly co-spatial with previously identified optical dust filaments, extraplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, and neutral and ionized gaseous outflows. The 70/160 um flux ratio, a proxy for dust temperature, is elevated along the edges of the cones, indicating that the dusty medium has been driven out of the central regions of these cones and possibly shock-heated by an outflow. We establish lower limits on the extraplanar dust mass and mean height above the stellar disk of log(M_d/M_sun) = 6.48 and |z| ~ 5 kpc, respectively. The energy requirement of (5.1-9.6) x 10^{56} ergs needed to lift the dusty material, assuming Milky-Way like dust-to-gas ratio, can be supplied by the current starburst, with measured star formation rate of 3.5-5.4 M_sun yr^{-1}, over a timescale of (4-26) xi^{-1} Myr, where xi is the efficiency of energy transfer. We conclude that a starburst-driven outflow is the most likely mechanism by which the dust features were formed.</description>

      <title>The vertical structure of galactic discs: nonlocal gravity versus dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent isolated galactic simulations show that the morphology of galactic discs in modified gravity differs from that of the standard dark matter model. In this study, we focused on the vertical structure of galactic discs and compared the bending instability in the vertical direction for both paradigms. To achieve this, we utilized high-resolution N-body simulations to construct two models in a specific nonlocal gravity theory (NLG) and the standard dark matter model and compared their stability against the bending perturbations. Our numerical results demonstrate that the outer regions of the disc are more susceptible to the instability in NLG, whereas the disc embedded in the dark matter halo is more unstable in the central regions. We then interpret these results based on the dispersion relation of the bending waves. To do so, we presented an analytical study to derive the dispersion relation in NLG. Our numerical results align with the predictions of our analytical models. Consequently, we conclude that the analysis of bending instability in galactic discs offers an explanation for the distinct vertical structures observed in simulated galactic discs under these two theories. These findings represent a significant step towards distinguishing between the modified gravity and dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the IRDC G351.77-0.53: Gaia DR3 distance, mass distribution, and star formation content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While intensively studied, it remains unclear how the star formation (SF) in Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) compares to that of nearby clouds. We study G351.77-0.53 (henceforth G351), a cluster-forming filamentary IRDC. We begin by characterizing its young stellar object (YSO) content. Based on the average parallax of likely members, we obtain a Gaia distance of $\sim\,2.0\pm0.14$ kpc, resolving the literature distance ambiguity. Using our Herschel-derived N(H$_2$) map, we measure a total gas mass of 10200 M$_{\odot}$ (within 11 pc$^2$) and the average line-mass profile of the entire filament, which we model as $\lambda =~1660 (w/\rm pc )^{0.62}\,\,M_{\odot}\,\rm{pc}^{-1}$. At $w &lt; 0.63$ pc, our $\lambda$ profile is higher and has a steeper power-law index than $\lambda$ profiles extracted in Orion A and most of its substructures. Based on the YSOs inside the filament area, we estimate the SF efficiency (SFE) and SF rate (SFR). We calculate a factor of 5 incompleteness correction for our YSO catalog relative to Spitzer surveys of Orion A. The G351 SFE is $\sim 1.8$ times lower than that of Orion A and lower than the median value for local clouds. We measure SFR and gas masses to estimate the efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon _{\rm ff}$. We find that $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ is $\sim$ 1.1 dex below the previously proposed mean local relation, and $\sim\,4.7\times$ below Orion A. These observations indicate that local SF-relations do not capture variations present in the Galaxy. We speculate that cloud youth and/or magnetic fields might account for the G351 inefficiency.</description>

  l' = l_{\rm Jeans} \frac{1} {(1 + \lambda_0' / 4 \pi G \rho_0)^{1/2}} \;. $$ She further concludes that the Jeans mass is $m_{\rm incorrect}'=m_{\rm Jeans} ( 1/(1 + \lambda_0' / 4 \pi G \rho_0)^{3/2})$. We clarify that due to the inhomogeneous nature of tides, this characteristic mass is incorrect. Under weak tides, the mass is $m \approx \rho\, l_1 l_2 l_3$, where the modifications to Jeans lengths along all three dimensions need to be considered; when the tide is strong enough, collapse can only occur once 1 or 2 dimensions. In the latter case, tides can stretch the gas, leading to the formation of filaments.</description>

      <title>Elemental abundances in the diffuse ISM from joint FUV and X-ray spectroscopy: iron, oxygen, carbon and sulfur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate interstellar absorption lines along the line of sight toward the galactic low-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2. We combine absorption line data obtained from high-resolution X-ray spectra collected with Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites, along with Far-UV absorption lines observed by the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) Instrument. Our primary objective is to understand the abundance and depletion of oxygen, iron, sulfur, and carbon. To achieve this, we have developed an analysis pipeline that simultaneously fits both the UV and X-ray datasets. This novel approach takes into account the line spread function (LSF) of HST/COS, enhancing the precision of our results. We examine the absorption lines of FeII, SII, CII, and CI present in the FUV spectrum of Cygnus X-2, revealing the presence of at least two distinct absorbers characterized by different velocities. Additionally, we employ Cloudy simulations to compare our findings concerning the ionic ratios for the studied elements. We find that gaseous iron and sulfur exist in their singly ionized forms, Fe II and S II, respectively, while the abundances of CII and CI do not agree with the Cloudy simulations of the neutral ISM. Finally, we explore discrepancies in the X-ray atomic data of iron and discuss their impact on the overall abundance and depletion of iron.</description>

      <title>Mass assembly in massive star formation: a fragmentation study of ATLASGAL clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass assembly in star forming regions arises from the hierarchical structure in molecular clouds in tandem with fragmentation at different scales. In this paper, we present a study of the fragmentation of massive clumps covering a range of evolutionary states, selected from the ATLASGAL survey, using the compact configuration of the Submillimeter Array. The observations reveal a wide diversity in the fragmentation properties with about 60% of the sources showing limited to no fragmentation at the 2" scale, or a physical scale of 0.015 - 0.09 pc. We also find several examples where the cores detected with the Submillimeter array are significantly offset from the clump potential suggesting that initial fragmentation does not result in the formation of a large number of Jeans mass fragments. The fraction of the clump mass that is in compact structures is seen to increase with source evolution. We also see a significant correlation between the maximum mass of a fragment and the bolometric luminosity of the parent clump. These suggest that massive star formation proceeds through clump fed core accretion with the initial fragmentation being dependent on the density structure of the clumps and/or magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Cold Filaments Formed in Hot Wake Flows Uplifted by AGN Bubbles in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength observations indicate that the intracluster medium in some galaxy clusters contains cold filaments, while their formation mechanism remains debated. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show that cold filaments could naturally condense out of hot gaseous wake flows uplifted by the jet-inflated active galactic nucleus (AGN) bubbles. Consistent with observations, the simulated filaments extend to tens of kpc from the cluster center, with a representative mass of $\rm 10^{8}- 10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ for a typical AGN outburst energy of $10^{60}~ \rm erg$. They show smooth velocity gradients, stretching typically from inner inflows to outer outflows with velocity dispersions of several hundred $\rm km\ s^{-1}$. The properties of cold filaments are affected substantially by jet properties. Compared to kinetic energy-dominated jets, thermal energy-dominated jets tend to produce longer cold filaments with higher masses. With the same jet energy, AGN jets with an earlier turn-on time, a lower jet base, or a higher power heat the cluster center more effectively, and produce shorter filaments at a much later epoch.</description>

      <title>Simulations of galaxies in an expanding Universe with modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and with modified gravitational attractions (MOGA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of galaxies is either explained by the existence of dark matter or caused by a modification of Newtonian acceleration (MOND). Here we show that the modification of the Newtonian dynamics can equally well be obtained by a modification of Newton's law of universal gravitational attraction (MOGA), by which an inverse square attraction from a distant object is replaced with an inverse attraction. This modification is often proposed in the standard model, and with the modification of the attraction caused by dark matter. The recently derived algorithm, Eur. Phys. J. Plus 137, 99 (2022); Class. Quantum Grav. 39, 225006 (2022), for classical celestial dynamics is used to simulate models of the Milky Way in an expanding universe and with either MOND or MOGA. The simulations show that the galaxies with MOND dynamics are unstable whereas MOGA stabilizes the galaxies. The rotation velocities for objects in galaxies with classical Newtonian dynamics decline inversely proportional to the square root of the distance $r$ to the galaxy's center. However, the rotation velocities are relatively independent of $r$ for MOGA and qualitatively in agreement with experimentally determined rotation curves for galaxies in the Universe. The modification of the attractions may be caused by the masses of the objects in the central part of the galaxy by the lensing of gravitational waves from far-away objects in the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundances and deviations from the solar S/O ratio in the gas-phase ISM of galaxies based on infrared emission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infrared (IR) range is extremely useful in the context of chemical abundance studies of the gas-phase interstellar medium (ISM) due to the large variety of ionic species traced in this regime, the negligible effects from dust attenuation or temperature stratification, and the amount of data that has been and will be released in the coming years. Taking advantage of available IR emission lines, we analysed the chemical content of the gas-phase ISM in a sample of 131 Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGs) and 73 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Particularly, we derived the chemical content via their total oxygen abundance in combination with nitrogen and sulfur abundances, and with the ionisation parameter. We used a new version of the code HII-CHI-Mistry-IR v3.1 which allows us to estimate log(N/O), 12+log(O/H), log(U), and, for the first time, 12+log(S/H) from IR emission lines, which can be applied to both SFGs and AGNs. We tested that the estimations from this new version, that only considers sulfur lines for the derivation of sulfur abundances, are compatible with previous studies. While most of the SFGs and AGNs show solar log(N/O) abundances, we found a large spread in the log(S/O) relative abundances. Specifically, we found extremely low log(S/O) values (1/10th solar) in some SFGs and AGNs with solar-like oxygen abundances. This result warns against the use of optical and IR sulfur emission lines to estimate oxygen abundances when no prior estimation of log(S/O) is provided.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties and Kinematics of Dense Cores Associated with Regions of Massive Star Formation from the Southern Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of spectral observations in the $\sim 84-92$ GHz frequency range of six objects in the southern sky containing dense cores and associated with regions of massive stars and star clusters formation are presented. The observations were carried out with the MOPRA-22m radio telescope. Within the framework of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation, the column densities and abundances of the H$^{13}$CN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HN$^{13}$C, HC$_3$N, c-C$_3$H$_2$, SiO, CH$_3$C$_2$H and CH$_3$CN molecules are calculated. Estimates of kinetic temperatures ($\sim 30-50$ K), sizes of emission regions ($\sim 0.2-3.1$ pc) and virial masses ($\sim 70-4600~M_{\odot}$) are obtained. The line widths in the three cores decrease with increasing distance from the center. In four cores, asymmetry in the profiles of the optically thick lines HCO$^+$(1-0) and HCN(1-0) is observed, indicating the presence of systematic motions along the line of sight. In two cases, the asymmetry can be caused by contraction of gas. The model spectral maps of HCO$^+$(1-0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1-0), obtained within the framework of the non-LTE spherically symmetric model, are fitted into the observed ones. The radial profiles of density ($\propto r^{-1.6}$), turbulent velocity ($\propto r^{-0.2}$), and contraction velocity ($\propto r^{0.5}$) in the G268.42--0.85 core have been calculated. The contraction velocity profile differs from that expected both in the case of free fall of gas onto a protostar ($\propto r^{-0.5}$), and in the case of global core collapse (contraction velocity does not depend on distance). A discussion of the obtained results is provided.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance Method in the Near Infrared. I. HST WFC3/IR F110W and F160W Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distance method in the I band is one of the most efficient and precise techniques for measuring distances to nearby galaxies (D &lt;= 15 Mpc). The TRGB in the near infrared (NIR) is 1 to 2 magnitudes brighter relative to the I band, and has the potential to expand the range over which distance measurements to nearby galaxies are feasible. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of 12 fields in 8 nearby galaxies, we determine color-based corrections and zero points of the TRGB in the Wide Field Camera 3 IR (WFC3/IR) F110W and F160W filters. First, we measure TRGB distances in the I band equivalent Advanced Camera System (ACS) F814W filter from resolved stellar populations with the HST. The TRGB in the ACS F814W filter is used for our distance anchor and to place the WFC3/IR magnitudes on an absolute scale. We then determine the color dependence (a proxy for metallicity/age) and zero point of the NIR TRGB from photometry of WFC3/IR fields which overlap with the ACS fields. The new calibration is accurate to ~1% in distance, relative to the F814W TRGB. Validating the accuracy of the calibrations, we find that the distance modulus for each field using the NIR TRGB calibration agrees with the distance modulus of the same fields as determined from the F814W TRGB. This is a JWST preparatory program and the work done here will directly inform our approach to calibrating the TRGB in JWST NIRCam and NIRISS photometric filters.</description>

      <title>Galaxies in the Zone of Avoidance: Misclassifications using machine learning tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated methods for classifying extragalactic objects in large surveys offer significant advantages compared to manual approaches in terms of efficiency and consistency. However, the existence of the Galactic disk raises additional concerns. These regions are known for high levels of interstellar extinction, star crowding, and limited data sets and studies. In this study, we explore the identification and classification of galaxies in the Zone of Avoidance (ZoA). In particular, we compare our results in the near-infrared with X-ray data. We analize the appearance of the objects classified as galaxies using machine learning by Zhang et al. (2021) in the Galactic disk and make a comparison with the visually confirmed galaxies from the VVV NIRGC (Baravalle et al. (2021). Our analysis, which includes the visual inspection of all sources catalogued as galaxies throughout the Galactic disk using machine learning techniques reveals significant differences. Only 4 galaxies were found in both the near-Infrared and X-ray data sets. Several specific regions of interest within the ZoA exhibit a high probability of being galaxies in X-ray data but closely resemble extended Galactic objects. The results indicate the difficulty of using machine learning methods for galaxy classification in the ZoA mainly due to the scarce information on galaxies behind the Galactic plane in the training set. They also stress the importance of considering specific factors that are present to improve the reliability and accuracy of future studies in this challenging region.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the 3D Structure of Molecular Cloud Envelopes in the "Cloud Factory" Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage recent numerical simulations of highly resolved star-forming regions in a Milky Way-like Galaxy to explore the nature of extended gaseous envelopes around molecular clouds. We extract a sample of two dozen star-forming clouds from the feedback-dominated suite of the "Cloud Factory'' simulations. With the goal of exploring the 3D thermal and chemical structure of the gas, we measure and fit the clouds' radial profiles in multiple tracers, including $n_{H_I}$, $n_{H_2}$, $n_{H_{tot}}$, $n_{CO}$, and gas temperature. We find that while solar neighborhood clouds recently detected via 3D dust mapping have radially symmetric, low-density envelopes that extend $\sim$ 10-15 pc, the simulated cloud envelopes are primarily radially asymmetric with low-density envelopes that extend only $\sim$ 2-3 pc. One potential explanation for the absence of extended envelopes in the simulated clouds may be the lack of magnetic fields, while a stronger local feedback prescription compared to solar neighborhood conditions may drive the radially asymmetric cloud morphologies. We make the pipeline to extract and characterize the radial profile of clouds publicly available, which can be used in complementary and future simulations to shed additional light on the key physics shaping the formation and evolution of star-forming structures in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>A3COSMOS &amp; A3GOODSS: Continuum Source Catalogues and Multi-band Number Counts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy submillimetre number counts are a fundamental measurement in our understanding of galaxy evolution models. Most early measurements are obtained via single-dish telescopes with substantial source confusion, whereas recent interferometric observations are limited to small areas. We used a large database of ALMA continuum observations to accurately measure galaxy number counts in multiple (sub)millimetre bands, thus bridging the flux density range between single-dish surveys and deep interferometric studies. We continued the Automated Mining of the ALMA Archive in the COSMOS Field project (A3COSMOS) and extended it with observations from the GOODS-South field (A3GOODSS). The database consists of ~4,000 pipeline-processed continuum images from the public ALMA archive, yielding 2,050 unique detected sources. To infer galaxy number counts, we constructed a method to reduce the observational bias inherent to targeted pointings that dominate the database. This method comprises a combination of image selection, masking, and source weighting. The effective area was calculated by accounting for inhomogeneous wavelengths, sensitivities, and resolutions and for spatial overlap between images. We tested and calibrated our method with simulations. We obtained the first number counts derived in a consistent and homogeneous way in four different ALMA bands covering a relatively large area. The results are consistent with number counts from the literature within the uncertainties. We extended the available depth in ALMA Band 4 by 0.4 dex with respect to previous studies. In Band 7, at the depth of the inferred number counts, ~40% of the cosmic infrared background is resolved into discrete sources. This fraction, however, decreases with wavelength, reaching ~4% in Band 3. Finally, we used the number counts to test models of dusty galaxy evolution, and find a good agreement within the uncertainties.</description>

      <title>JWST PRIMER: A new multi-field determination of the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function at redshifts $\mathbf{z \simeq 9-15}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new determination of the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) over the redshift range $8.5&lt;z&lt;15.5$ using a combination of several major Cycle-1 JWST imaging programmes - PRIMER, JADES and NGDEEP. This multi-field approach yields a total of $\simeq370$ sq. arcmin of JWST/NIRCam imaging, reaching (5-$\sigma$) depths of $\simeq30$ AB mag in the deepest regions. We select a sample of 2548 galaxies with a significant probability of lying at high redshift ($p(z&gt;8.5)&gt;0.05$) to undertake a statistical calculation of the evolving UV LF. Our new measurements span $\simeq4$ magnitudes in UV luminosity at $z=9-12.5$, placing new constraints on both the shape and evolution of the LF at early times. We fit our observational data-points with a double-power law (DPL) function and explore the evolution of the DPL parameters. Our UV LF measurements yield a new estimate of the early evolution of cosmic star-formation rate density ($\rho_{\rm{SFR}}$) which confirms the gradual, log-linear decline deduced from early JWST studies, at least out to $z \simeq 12$. Finally we show that the observed early evolution of the galaxy UV LF (and $\rho_{\rm{SFR}}$) can be reproduced in a ${\rm \Lambda}$CDM Universe, with no change in dust properties or star-formation efficiency required out to $z \simeq 12$. Instead, we show that a progressive trend towards younger stellar population ages can reproduce the observations, and we show that the typical ages required at $z \simeq$ 8, 9, 10, and 11 all converge on a time $\simeq 380-330$ Myr after the Big Bang, indicative of a rapid emergence of early galaxies at $z \simeq 12 - 13$. This is consistent with the first indications of a steeper drop-off in the galaxy population we find beyond $z \simeq 13$, possibly reflecting the rapid evolution of the halo mass function at earlier times.</description>

      <title>Searching for globular clusters in the inner halo of the Circinus galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we search for Globular Clusters (GCs) in the inner halo of the Circinus galaxy using a combination of observational data. Our dataset includes observations from the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea Extended Survey (VVVX), optical data from Gaia Release 3 (DR3), and observations from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). These multiple data sources provide a comprehensive basis for our analysis. Our search was concentrated within a 50 kpc radius from the centre, leading to the identification of 93 sources that met our established criteria. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we conducted multiple examinations for sample contamination. These examinations incorporated tests based on Gaia Astrometric Excess Noise (AEN), the Blue Photometer (BP)/Red Photometer (RP) Excess Factor (BRexcess), as well as comparisons with stellar population models.
  This analysis confidently classified 41 sources as genuine GCs, as they successfully passed both the 3$\sigma$ Gaia AEN and BRexcess tests. We used the ISHAPE program to determine the structural parameters (half-light radii) of the GC candidates, with a peak effective radius of 4$\pm$ 0.5 pc. The catalogue mainly consists of bright GCs. Relationships between colour, size, and distance were found in the GC candidates, alongside confirmation of bi-modality in colour distributions.</description>

Abstract: We present rest-frame optical data of the z~4 sub-millimeter galaxy GN20 obtained with JWST/NIRSpec in integral field spectroscopy (IFS) mode. The H$\alpha$ emission is asymmetric and clumpy and extends over a projected distance of more than 15 kpc. To first order, the large-scale ionised gas kinematics are consistent with a turbulent ($\sigma\sim90$ km/s), rotating disc ($v_{\rm rot}\sim500$ km/s), congruent with previous studies of its molecular and ionised gas kinematics. However, we also find clear evidence for non-circular motions in the H$\alpha$ kinematics. We discuss their possible connection with various scenarios, such as external perturbations, accretion or radial flows. In the centre of GN20, we find broad line emission (FWHM $\sim1000-2000$ km/s) in the H$\alpha$+[N II] complex, suggestive of fast, AGN-driven winds or, alternatively, of the broad-line region of an active black hole. Elevated values of [N II]$\lambda6583$/H$\alpha&gt;0.4$ and EW(H$\alpha)&gt;6$ \r{A}, throughout large parts of GN20 suggest that feedback from the active black hole is able to photo-ionise the interstellar medium. Our data corroborates that GN20 offers a unique opportunity to observe key processes in the evolution of the most massive present-day galaxies acting in concert, over 12 billion years ago.</description>

      <title>Examining Lyman-alpha Emitters through MillenniumTNG in anticipation of DESI-II</title>

Abstract: The goal of this study is to conduct a timely analysis of the high-redshift star-forming galaxy populations, which will be informative in designing next-generation experiments and their extragalactic targets. We use the hydrodynamical simulation MillenniumTNG (MTNG) to model Lyman-alpha Emitting (LAE) galaxies to extract key properties such as their clustering and occupation statistics. We define LAEs through an empirical relation between star formation rate (SFR) and Lyman-alpha flux. We also explore two other definitions, finding that imposing an additional cut on the maximum stellar mass of the galaxy sample, which approximates the effect of a low escape fraction at high halo mass, leads to a 5-10\% decrease of the linear bias of the population. As expected, we find that the HOD mass parameters rapidly decrease with increasing number density. Additionally, the HOD parameter $\sigma$ also decreases with number density, implying that the SFR-halo mass relationship becomes tighter for low-luminosity objects. Surprisingly, the non-linear clustering, estimated by the parameter $r_0$, is fixed at fixed number density, whereas the linear bias parameter varies with redshift as $b(z) \propto (1 + z)$, suggesting that our LAE samples are relatively stable and long-lived. Finally, we study the amount of galaxy assembly bias present at $z = 2, \ 3$ and find that while at $z = 2$ it is roughly $\lesssim$10\%, at $z = 3$ it decreases significantly to $\lesssim$5\%. This suggests that assembly bias effects become less important at high $z$ likely due to the lower number of cumulative two-halo interactions (mergers, splashback, stripping, etc.). While our study is based on a single full-physics simulation, we expect our results to reflect the properties of LAEs in the Universe. We demonstrate that our findings are in good agreement with previous results using both observations and simulations.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous millisecond-duration radio pulses with extragalactic origin, which were discovered more than a decade ago. Despite the numerous samples, the physical origin of FRBs remains poorly understood. FRBs have been thought to originate from young magnetars or accreting compact objects (COs). Massive stars or COs are predicted to be embedded in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The dense disk absorbs FRBs severely, making them difficult to observe. However, progenitors ejecta or outflow feedback from the accreting COs interact with the disk material to form a cavity. The existence of the cavity can reduce the absorption by the dense disk materials, making FRBs escape. Here we investigate the production and propagation of FRBs in AGN disks and find that the AGN environments lead to the following unique observational properties, which can be verified in future observation. First, the dense material in the disk can cause large dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM). Second, the toroidal magnetic field in the AGN disk can cause Faraday conversion. Third, during the shock breakout, DM and RM show non-power-law evolution patterns over time. Fourth, for accreting-powered models, higher accretion rates lead to more bright bursts in AGN disks.</description>

      <title>On Cepheid distances in the $H_0$ measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids were the first stellar standard candles and have played a crucial role for astronomical distance measurements ever since the discovery of the Leavitt law (period-luminosity relation). Enormous improvements in distance accuracy have been achieved since Hertzsprung's first application of Leavitt's law to measure the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud in 1913, notably in very recent years thanks to a large data set of highly accurate space astrometry from the ESA mission Gaia. Complemented by homogeneous space photometry, Cepheids enable the most accurate distance estimates to galaxies hosting type-Ia supernovae up to approximately 70 Mpc distant. Here, I review the history of Cepheid distance measurements, open questions on the side of stellar astrophysics, and recent studies seeking to quantify and mitigate systematics with a view to further improve the accuracy on the Hubble constant. For example, the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope will enhance precision due to 4x lower sensitivity to source blending in crowded regions and greater sensitivity in dust-insensitive infrared bands. Future 30m-class telescopes could in principle further improve Cepheid distance measurements towards the Hubble flow, if technical challenges related to a continuously evolving instrument can be overcome.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Surveying the distant Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the most active period of star formation in galaxies, which occurs in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;3, strong bursts of star formation result in significant quantities of dust, which obscures new stars being formed as their UV/optical light is absorbed and then re-emitted in the infrared, which redshifts into the mm/sub-mm bands for these early times. To get a complete picture of the high-z galaxy population, we need to survey a large patch of the sky in the sub-mm with sufficient angular resolution to resolve all galaxies, but we also need the depth to fully sample their cosmic evolution, and therefore obtain their redshifts using direct mm spectroscopy with a very wide frequency coverage. This requires a large single-dish sub-mm telescope with fast mapping speeds at high sensitivity and angular resolution, a large bandwidth with good spectral resolution and multiplex spectroscopic capabilities. The proposed 50-m Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) will deliver these specifications. We discuss how AtLAST allows us to study the whole population of high-z galaxies, including the dusty star-forming ones which can only be detected and studied in the sub-mm, and obtain a wealth of information for each of these up to z~7: gas content, cooling budget, star formation rate, dust mass, and dust temperature. We present worked examples of surveys that AtLAST can perform, both deep and wide, and also focused on galaxies in proto-clusters. In addition we show how such surveys with AtLAST can measure the growth rate and the Hubble constant with high accuracy, and demonstrate the power of the line-intensity mapping method in the mm/sub-mm wavebands to constrain the cosmic expansion history at high redshifts, as good examples of what can uniquely be done by AtLAST in this research field.</description>

      <title>Search for giant planets in M67 V: a warm Jupiter orbiting the turn-off star S1429</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets orbiting members of open or globular clusters offer a great opportunity to study exoplanet populations systematically as stars within clusters provide a mostly homogeneous sample at least in chemical composition and stellar age. However, even though there have been coordinated efforts to search for exoplanets in stellar clusters, only a small number of planets has been detected. One successful example is the seven-year radial velocity (RV) survey "Search for giant planets in M67" of 88 stars in the open cluster M67 which led to the discovery of five giant planets, including three close-in ($P &lt; 10$ days) hot-Jupiters. In this work, we continue and extend the observation of stars in M67 with the aim to search for additional planets. We conducted spectroscopic observations with the HPF, HARPS, HARPS-North, and SOPHIE spectrographs of 11 stars in M67. Six of our targets showed a variation or long-term trends in their RV during the original survey, while the other five were not observed in the original sample bringing the total number of stars to 93. An analysis of the radial velocities revealed one additional planet around the turn-off point star S1429 and gave solutions for the orbits of stellar companions around S2207 and YBP2018. S1429 b is a warm Jupiter on a likely circular orbit with a period of $77.48_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$ days and a minimum mass $\text{M} \sin i = 1.80 \pm 0.2$ M$_\text{J}$. We update the hot-Jupiter occurrence rate in M67 to include the five new stars, deriving $4.2_{-2.3}^{+4.1} \%$ when considering all stars, and $5.4_{-3.0}^{+5.1} \%$ if binary star systems are removed.</description>

      <title>Radio outburst from a massive (proto)star. III. Unveiling the bipolarity of the radio jet from S255IR NIRS3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new Very Large Array high-resolution observations of the radio jet from the outbursting high-mass star S255IR~NIRS3. The images at 6, 10, and 22.2 GHz confirm the existence of a new lobe emerging to the SW and expanding at a mean speed of ~285 km/s, about half as fast as the NE lobe. The new data allow us to reproduce both the morphology and the continuum spectrum of the two lobes with the model already adopted in our previous studies. We conclude that in all likelihood both lobes are powered by the same accretion outburst. We also find that the jet is currently fading down, recollimating, and recombining.</description>

      <title>Tight stellar binaries favour active longitudes at sub- and anti-stellar points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar binaries are ubiquitous in the galaxy and a laboratory for astrophysical effects. We use TESS to study photometric modulations in the lightcurves of 162 unequal mass eclipsing binaries from the EBLM (Eclipsing Binary Low Mass) survey, comprising F/G/K primaries and M-dwarf secondaries. We detect modulations on 81 eclipsing binaries. We catalog the rotation rates of the primary star in 69 binaries and discover 17 ellipsoidal variables. In a large portion (at least $\sim 51\%$) of our sample, we detect photometric modulations consistent with two over-densities of spots on the primary star that are roughly $180^{\circ}$ apart. We show that these so-called active longitudes are preferentially at the sub- and anti-stellar points on the primary star. Physically, this means that the spots on the primary star preferentially face directly towards and away from the secondary star.</description>

      <title>Impact of $\alpha$ enhancement on the asteroseismic age determination of field stars. Application to the APO-K2 catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the theoretical biases affecting the asteroseismic grid-based estimates of stellar parameters in the presence of a mismatch between the heavy element mixture of observed stars and stellar models. We performed a controlled simulation adopting effective temperature, [Fe/H], average large frequency spacing, and frequency of maximum oscillation power as observational constraints. Synthetic stars were sampled from grids of stellar models computed with different [alpha/Fe] values from 0.0 to 0.4. The mass, radius, and age of these objects were then estimated by adopting a grid of models with a fixed [alpha/Fe] value of 0.0. The experiment was repeated assuming different sets of observational uncertainties. In the reference scenario, we adopted an uncertainty of 1.5% in seismic parameters, 50 K in effective temperature, and 0.05 dex in [Fe/H]. A higher uncertainty in the atmospheric constraints was also adopted in order to explore the impact on the precision of the observations of the estimated stellar parameters. Our simulations showed that estimated parameters are biased up to 3% in mass, 1.5% in radius, and 4% in age when the reference uncertainty scenario was adopted. These values correspond to 45%, 48%, and 16% of the estimated uncertainty in the stellar parameters. These biases in mass and radius disappear when adopting larger observational uncertainties because of the possibility of the fitting algorithm exploring a wider range of possible solutions. However, in this scenario, the age is significantly biased by -8%. Finally, we verified that the stellar mass, radius, and age can be estimated with a high accuracy by adopting a grid with the incorrect value of [alpha/Fe] if the metallicity [Fe/H] of the target is adjusted to match the Z in the fitting grid. In this scenario, the maximum bias in the age was reduced to 1.5%.</description>

      <title>Large-scale excess HI absorption around $z\approx4$ galaxies detected in a background galaxy spectrum in the MUSE eXtremely Deep Field</title>

Abstract: Observationally mapping the relation between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) is of key interest for studies of cosmic reionization. Diffuse hydrogen gas has typically been observed in HI Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) absorption in the spectra of bright background quasars. However, it is important to extend these measurements to background galaxies as quasars become increasingly rare at high redshift and rarely probe closely separated sight-lines. Here we use deep integral field spectroscopy in the MUSE eXtremely Deep Field to demonstrate the measurement of the Ly$\alpha$ transmission at $z\approx4$ in absorption to a background galaxy at $z=4.77$. The HI transmission is consistent with independent quasar sight-lines at similar redshifts. Exploiting the high number of spectroscopic redshifts of faint galaxies (500 between $z=4.0-4.7$ within a radius of 8 arcmin) that are tracers of the density field, we show that Ly$\alpha$ transmission is inversely correlated with galaxy density, i.e. transparent regions in the Ly$\alpha$ forest mark under-dense regions at $z\approx4$. Due to large-scale clustering, galaxies are surrounded by excess HI absorption over the cosmic mean out to 4 cMpc/h. We also find that redshifts from the peak of the Ly$\alpha$ line are typically offset from the systemic redshift by +170 km/s. This work extends results from $z\approx 2 - 3$ to higher redshifts and demonstrates the power of deep integral field spectroscopy to simultaneously measure the ionization structure of the IGM and the large-scale density field in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Radio outburst from a massive (proto)star. II. A portrait in space and time of the expanding radio jet from S255 NIRS3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations indicate that the accretion process in star formation may occur through accretion outbursts. This phenomenon has also now been detected in a few young massive (proto)stars (&gt;8 Msun). The recent outburst at radio wavelengths of the massive (proto)star S255 NIRS3 has been interpreted by us as expansion of a thermal jet, fed by the infalling material. To follow up on our previous study and confirm our interpretation, we monitored the source for more than 1 yr in six bands from 1.5 GHz to 45.5 GHz and, after ~1.5 yr, with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at two epochs, which made it possible to detect the proper motions of the jet lobes. The prediction of our previous study is confirmed by the new results. The radio jet is found to expand, while the flux, after an initial exponential increase, appears to stabilise and eventually decline. The radio flux measured during our monitoring is attributed to a single NE lobe, However, from 2019 a second lobe has been emerging to the SW, probably powered by the same accretion outburst, although with a delay of at least a couple of years. Flux densities at &gt;6 GHz were satisfactorily fitted with a jet model, whereas those below 6 GHz are clearly underestimated by the model. This indicates that non-thermal emission becomes dominant at long wavelengths. Our results suggest that thermal jets can be a direct consequence of accretion events, when yearly flux variations are detected. The end of the accretion outburst is mirrored in the radio jet, as ~1 yr after the onset of the radio outburst, the inner radius of the jet began to increase while the jet mass stopped growing, as expected if the powering mechanism of the jet is quenched. Our findings support a tight connection between accretion and ejection in massive stars, consistent with a formation process involving a disk-jet system similar to that of low-mass stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have imaged the entirety of eight (plus one partial) Milky Way-like satellite systems, a total of 42 (45) satellites, from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) II catalog in both H$\alpha$ and HI with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Jansky Very Large Array. In these eight systems we have identified four cases where a satellite appears to be currently undergoing ram pressure stripping (RPS) as its HI gas collides with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of its host. We also see a clear suppression of gas fraction ($M_\mathrm{HI}/M_\ast$) with decreasing (projected) satellite--host separation; to our knowledge, the first time this has been observed in a sample of Milky Way-like systems. Comparisons to the Auriga, APOSTLE, and TNG50 cosmological zoom-in simulations show consistent global behavior, but they systematically under-predict gas fractions across all satellites by roughly 0.5 dex. Using a simplistic RPS model we estimate the average peak CGM density that satellites in these systems have encountered to be $\log \rho_\mathrm{cgm}/\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}} \approx -27.3$. Furthermore, we see tentative evidence that these satellites are following a specific star formation rate-to-gas fraction relation that is distinct from field galaxies. Finally, we detect one new gas-rich satellite in the UGC903 system with an optical size and surface brightness meeting the standard criteria to be considered an ultra-diffuse galaxy.</description>

Abstract: We study a sample of 14 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\alpha$ Emitters (LAEs) in the late era of reionization (at redshift $z\approx6$) based on the JWST/NIRCam imaging dataset. These LAEs with high Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $L$(Ly$\alpha$) $\sim10^{42.4-43.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$ have been covered by the (ongoing) COSMOS-Web survey (Kartaltepe et al. 2021; Casey et al. 2022) over $0.28$ deg$^2$ in four NIRCam bands (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W). With JWST imaging, we determine the UV continua with $M_{\rm UV}$ ranging from ${-}20.5$ to ${-}18.5$ mag. The UV slopes have a median value of $\beta \approx-2.35$, and the steepest slope can reach $\beta&lt;-3$. Under an excellent spatial resolution of JWST, we identify three out of the sample as potential merging/interacting systems. The 14 LAEs (and their components) are compact in morphology residing substantially below the mass-size relation of high-$z$ galaxies. We further investigate the stellar mass ($M_*$) and star-formation rates (SFRs). Most of the LAEs lie on the SFR-$M_*$ main-sequence relation while two of them featured as "little red dots" likely host active galactic nuclei (AGN), implying a ${\sim}10\%$ AGN fraction. Moreover, we reveal that a new correlation may exist between Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width and the offset between Ly$\alpha$ and UV emission ($\Delta d_{\rm Ly\alpha}$) with a median $\Delta d_{\rm Ly\alpha} \sim 1$ kpc. This could be explained by Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer process in both ISM and CGM. The results usher a new era of detailed analysis on high-$z$ LAEs with the JWST capability.</description>

      <title>A phenomenological model for dark matter phase space distribution</title>

Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark matter is among the top priorities of modern physics. However, due to its inertness, detecting and studying it directly in terrestrial experiments is extremely challenging. Numerical N-body simulations currently represent the best approach for studying the particle properties and phase space distribution, assuming the collisionless nature of dark matter. These simulations also address the lack of a satisfactory theory for predicting the universal properties of dark matter halos, including the density profile and velocity distribution. In this work, we propose a new phenomenological model for the dark matter phase space distribution. This model aims to provide an NFW-like density profile, velocity magnitude distribution, and velocity component distributions that align closely with simulation data. Our model is relevant both for theoretical modeling of dark matter distributions, as well as for underground detector experiments that rely on the dark matter velocity distribution for experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Host galaxy and nuclear properties of IR-selected AGNs with and without outflow signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active galactic nucleus (AGN) driven outflows can have a significant impact on the evolution of the host galaxy. In this work, we compare the properties of galaxies that hosts AGNs with and without outflows. Our sample consists of 103 AGNs identified by mid-IR color-color selection, and confirmed with optical spectroscopy at a redshift range of 0.3 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 0.9. We fit the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 line using spectra from the zCOSMOS survey to identify and to study the occurrence of outflows. We find that ionized outflows are present in $\sim$25\% of our sample, with the largest incidence at the highest [OIII] and X-ray luminosity bins. The fastest outflows are found in the more extended and massive galaxies. We do not observe a difference in the star formation rate of AGNs with outflows compared to AGNs without outflows. From visual inspection and non-parametric morphological studies, we obtain that outflows are preferentially observed in galaxies with elliptical morphologies.</description>

      <title>Metal-poor star formation at $z&gt;6$ with JWST: new insight into hard radiation fields and nitrogen enrichment on 20 pc scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearly a decade ago, we began to see indications that reionization-era galaxies power hard radiation fields rarely seen at lower redshift. Most striking were detections of nebular CIV emission in what appeared to be typical low mass galaxies, requiring an ample supply of 48 eV photons to triply ionize carbon. The nature of this population has long remained unclear owing to limitations of ground-based spectroscopy. We have obtained deep JWST/NIRSpec R=1000 spectroscopy of the two z&gt;6 CIV-emitting galaxies known prior to JWST. Here we present a rest-UV to optical spectrum of one of these two systems, the multiply-imaged z=6.1 lensed galaxy RXCJ2248-ID. NIRCam imaging reveals two compact (&lt;22pc) clumps separated by 220pc, with one comprising a dense concentration of massive stars ($&gt;10,400M_{\odot}$/yr/kpc$^2$) formed in a recent burst. We stack spectra of 3 images of the galaxy (J=24.8-25.9), yielding a very deep spectrum providing a high S/N template of strong emission line sources at z&gt;6. The spectrum reveals narrow high ionization lines (HeII, CIV, NIV]) with line ratios consistent with powering by massive stars. The rest-optical spectrum is dominated by very strong emission lines ([OIII] EW=2800\AA), albeit with weak emission from low-ionization transitions ([OIII]/[OII]=184). The electron density is found to be very high($6.4-31\times10^4$cm$^{-3}$) based on three UV transitions. The ionized gas is metal poor ($12+\log(\rm O/H)=7.43^{+0.17}_{-0.09}$), yet highly enriched in nitrogen ($\log(\rm N/O)=-0.39^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$). The spectrum appears broadly similar to that of GNz11 at z=10.6, without showing the same AGN signatures. We suggest that the hard radiation field and rapid nitrogen enrichment may be a short-lived phase that many z&gt;6 galaxies go through as they undergo strong bursts of star formation. We comment on the potential link of such spectra to globular cluster formation.</description>

      <title>The Multi-layer Nature of Molecular Gas toward the Cygnus Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the physical properties and 3D distribution of molecular clouds (MCs) toward the Cygnus region using the MWISP CO survey and Gaia DR3 data. Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\rm ^{13}CO$ lines, over 70% of the fluxes are recovered. With the identification result of $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures, two models are designed to measure the distances of the molecular gas in velocity crowding regions. The distances of more than 200 large $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are obtained toward the 150 square degree region. Additionally, tens of the identified MC structures coincide well with masers and/or intense mid-IR emission. We find multiple gas layers toward the region: (1) the extensive gas structures composing the Cygnus Rift from 700 pc to 1 kpc across the whole region; (2) the $\sim$ 1.3 kpc gas layer mainly in the Cygnus X South region; and (3) the 1.5 kpc dense filament at the Cygnus X North region and many cometary clouds shaped by Cygnus OB2. We also note that the spatial distribution of YSO candidates is generally consistent with the molecular gas structures. The total molecular mass of the Cygnus region is estimated to be $\sim 2.7\times10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ assuming an X-factor ratio $X_{\rm CO} = 2 \times 10^{20} \rm cm^{-2} (K\cdot km\cdot s^{-1})^{-1}$. The foreground Cygnus Rift contributes $\sim$25% of the molecular mass in the whole region. Our work presents a new 3D view of the MCs distribution toward the Cygnus X region, as well as the exact molecular gas mass distribution in the foreground Cygnus Rift.</description>

      <title>Heating Galaxy Clusters with Interacting Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The overcooling of cool core clusters is a persistent puzzle in the astrophysics of galaxy clusters. We propose that it may naturally be resolved via interactions between the baryons of the intracluster medium (ICM) and its dark matter (DM). DM-baryon interactions can inject heat into the ICM to offset bremmstrahlung cooling, but these interactions are also strongly constrained by existing experiments and astrophysical observations. We survey existing constraints and combine these with the energetic needs of an observed sample of cool core clusters. We find that a robust parameter space exists for baryon-DM scattering solutions to the cooling flow problem, provided that only a sub-component of DM interacts strongly with the baryons. Interestingly, baryon-DM scattering is a thermally stable heating source so long as the baryon temperature is greater than $1/3-1/2$ the DM temperature, a condition that seems to be satisfied observationally.</description>

      <title>JASMINE: Near-Infrared Astrometry and Time Series Photometry Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Japan Astrometry Satellite Mission for INfrared Exploration (JASMINE) is a planned M-class science space mission by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. JASMINE has two main science goals. One is the Galactic archaeology with Galactic Center Survey, which aims to reveal the Milky Way's central core structure and formation history from Gaia-level (~25 $\mu$as) astrometry in the Near-Infrared (NIR) Hw-band (1.0-1.6 $\mu$m). The other is the Exoplanet Survey, which aims to discover transiting Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone from NIR time-series photometry of M dwarfs when the Galactic center is not accessible. We introduce the mission, review many science objectives, and present the instrument concept. JASMINE will be the first dedicated NIR astrometry space mission and provide precise astrometric information of the stars in the Galactic center, taking advantage of the significantly lower extinction in the NIR. The precise astrometry is obtained by taking many short-exposure images. Hence, the JASMINE Galactic center survey data will be valuable for studies of exoplanet transits, asteroseismology, variable stars and microlensing studies, including discovery of (intermediate mass) black holes. We highlight a swath of such potential science, and also describe synergies with other missions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Architectures of S-type Transiting Planets in Binaries I: Target Selection using Hipparcos and Gaia proper motion anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of stellar multiplicity on planetary architecture and orbital dynamics provides an important context for exoplanet demographics. We present a volume-limited catalog up to 300 pc of 66 stars hosting planets and planet candidates from Kepler, K2 and TESS with significant Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomalies, which indicate the presence of companions. We assess the reliability of each transiting planet candidate using ground-based follow-up observations, and find that the TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) with significant proper motion anomalies show nearly four times more false positives due to Eclipsing Binaries compared to TOIs with marginal proper motion anomalies. In addition, we find tentative evidence that orbital periods of planets orbiting TOIs with significant proper motion anomalies are shorter than those orbiting TOIs without significant proper motion anomalies, consistent with the scenario that stellar companions can truncate planet-forming disks. Furthermore, TOIs with significant proper motion anomalies exhibit lower Gaia differential velocities in comparison to field stars with significant proper motion anomalies, suggesting that planets are more likely to form in binary systems with low-mass substellar companions or stellar companions at wider separation. Finally, we characterize the three-dimensional architecture of LTT 1445 ABC using radial velocities, absolute astrometry from Gaia and Hipparcos, and relative astrometry from imaging. Our analysis reveals that LTT 1445 is a nearly flat system, with a mutual inclination of 2.88 deg between the orbit of BC around A and that of C around B. The coplanarity may explain why multiple planets around LTT 1445 A survive in the dynamically hostile environment of this system.</description>

      <title>On the maximum black hole mass at solar metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high metallicity environments the mass that black holes (BHs) can reach just after core-collapse widely depends on how much mass their progenitor stars lose via winds. On one hand new theoretical and observational insights suggest that early-stage winds should be weaker than what many canonical models prescribe. On the other hand the proximity to the Eddington limit should affect the formation of optically thick envelopes already during the earliest stages of stars with initial masses $M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim 100$ M$_\odot$, hence resulting in higher mass-loss rates during the main sequence. We use the evolutionary codes MESA and Genec to calculate a suite of tracks for massive stars at solar metallicity Z$_\odot=0.014$ which incorporate these changes in our wind mass loss prescription. In our calculations we employ moderate rotation, high overshooting and magnetic angular momentum transport. We find a maximum BH mass $M_{\rm BH, max}=28.3$ M$_\odot$ at Z$_\odot$. The most massive BHs are predicted to form from stars with $M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim 250$ M$_\odot$, with the BH mass directly proportional to its progenitor's $M_{\rm ZAMS}$. We also find in our models that at Z$_\odot$ almost any BH progenitor naturally evolves into a Wolf-Rayet star due to the combined effect of internal mixing and wind mass loss. These results are considerably different from most recent studies regarding the final mass of stars before their collapse into BHs. While we acknowledge the inherent uncertainties in stellar evolution modelling, our study underscores the importance of employing the most up-to-date physics in BH mass predictions.</description>

      <title>The orbital evolution of the tidally stripped star and disk-driven stable mass transfer for QPEs in GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is possibly mass loss at the periastron of a body moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a high eccentric orbit. Such a tidally stripped star is expected to radiate gravitational wave thereby leading to shrinkage of the periastron distance, and thus will eventually be disrupted by the SMBH in the previous studies. This scenario predicts a gradually increasing mass transfer, contradicting the observed decay in the intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069. In this paper, we first revisited the orbital evolution of the stripped star. The effect of the mass transfer finally dominates the orbital evolution, resulting in the stripped star finally escaping the SMBH rather than being disrupted by it. Then we suggested a model of a tidal stripped WD moving inside an accretion disk for QPEs in GSN 069. The drag force by the disk can effectively reduce mass transfer and thus explain the observed decay in the intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069. The disk is likely a fallback disk of the tidal disruption event in GSN 069. Considering the evolution of its accretion rate, the increase in the intensity of the latest eruption can also be explained.</description>
