      <title>Linear correlations of Gibbs free energy for rare earth element oxide, hydroxide, chloride, fluoride, carbonate, and ferrite minerals and crystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare Earth Elements (REE) are critical minerals (metals) for the transition from fossil fuels to renewable and clean energy. Accurate thermodynamic properties of REE minerals and other crystalline solids are crucial for geochemical modeling of the solubility, speciation, and transport of REE in ore formation, extraction, chemical processing, and recycling processes. However, the Gibbs free energies of formation (DGof, REEX) for these solids from different sources vary by 10s kJ/mol. We applied the Sverjensky linear free energy relationship (LFER) to evaluate their internal consistency and predict the unavailable DGof of the REE solids. By considering both the effects of ionic radius size and corresponding aqueous ion properties, the Sverjensky LFER allows estimates with much accuracy and precision. Here, rREEZ+ represents the Shannon-Prewitt ionic radii of REEZ+, and DGon, REEZ+ denotes the non-solvation contribution to the DGof of the aqueous REEZ+ ion. X represents the remainder of the compounds. In this study, the parameters aREEX, bREEX, and beta REEX were regressed from DGof compilations in the literature for 13 isostructural families. Based on these linear relationships, we recommend a set of internally consistent DGof, REEX for 119 end-members of REE oxides, hydroxides, chlorides, fluorides, carbonates, hydrous carbonates, and ferrites. These DGof, REEX are combined with experimental or predicted values of So, Vo, and Cpo from the literature and incorporated into a new SUPCRT database, which allows the calculations of thermodynamic properties to high P-T conditions (e.g., up to 1000 oC and 5 kb).</description>

      <title>Generalized Solution for Double-Porosity Flow through a Graded Excavation Damaged Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of flow to boreholes or excavations in fractured low-permeability rocks is important for resource extraction and disposal or sequestration activities. Analytical solutions for fluid pressure and flowrate, when available, are powerful, insightful, and efficient tools enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. A flexible porous media flow solution for arbitrary physical dimension is derived and extended to double porosity for converging radial flow when permeability and porosity decrease radially as a power law away from a borehole or opening. This distribution can arise from damage accumulation due to stress relief associated with drilling or mining. The single-porosity graded conductivity solution was initially found for heat conduction, the arbitrary dimension flow solution comes from hydrology, and the solution with both arbitrary dimension and graded permeability distribution appeared in reservoir engineering. These existing solutions are here combined and extended to two implementations of the double-porosity conceptual model, for both a simpler thin-film mass transfer and more physically realistic diffusion between fracture and matrix. This work presents a new specified-flowrate solution with wellbore storage for the simpler double-porosity model, and a new more physically realistic solution for any wellbore boundary condition. A new closed-form expression is derived for the matrix diffusion solution (applicable to both homogeneous and graded problems), improving on previous infinite series expressions.</description>

      <title>Denoising of Geodetic Time Series Using Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks: Application to Slow Slip Event Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geospatial data has been transformative for the monitoring of the Earth, yet, as in the case of (geo)physical monitoring, the measurements can have variable spatial and temporal sampling and may be associated with a significant level of perturbations degrading the signal quality. Denoising geospatial data is, therefore, essential, yet often challenging because the observations may comprise noise coming from different origins, including both environmental signals and instrumental artifacts, which are spatially and temporally correlated, thus hard to disentangle. This study addresses the denoising of multivariate time series acquired by irregularly distributed networks of sensors, requiring specific methods to handle the spatiotemporal correlation of the noise and the signal of interest. Specifically, our method focuses on the denoising of geodetic position time series, used to monitor ground displacement worldwide with centimeter- to-millimeter precision. Among the signals affecting GNSS data, slow slip events (SSEs) are of interest to seismologists. These are transients of deformation that are weakly emerging compared to other signals. Here, we design SSEdenoiser, a multi-station spatiotemporal graph-based attentive denoiser that learns latent characteristics of GNSS noise to reveal SSE-related displacement with sub-millimeter precision. It is based on the key combination of graph recurrent networks and spatiotemporal Transformers. The proposed method is applied to the Cascadia subduction zone, where SSEs occur along with bursts of tectonic tremors, a seismic rumbling identified from independent seismic recordings. The extracted events match the spatiotemporal evolution of tremors. This good space-time correlation of the denoised GNSS signals with the tremors validates the proposed denoising procedure.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Geothermal Gradient in Colombia: a Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05184v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the geothermal gradient is critical for assessing the geothermal energy potential of a given region. Of particular interest is the case of Colombia, a country with abundant geothermal resources. A history of active oil and gas exploration and production has left drilled boreholes in different geological settings, providing direct measurements of the geothermal gradient. Unfortunately, large regions of the country where geothermal resources might exist lack such measurements. Indirect geophysical measurements are costly and difficult to perform at regional scales. Computational thermal models could be constructed, but they require very detailed knowledge of the underlying geology and uniform sampling of subsurface temperatures to be well-constrained. We present an alternative approach that leverages recent advances in supervised machine learning and available direct measurements to predict the geothermal gradient in regions where only global-scale geophysical datasets and course geological knowledge are available. We find that a Gradient Boosted Regression Tree algorithm yields optimal predictions and extensively validate the trained model. We show that predictions of our model are within 12% accuracy and that independent measurements performed by other authors agree well with our model. Finnally, we present a geothermal gradient map for Colombia that highlights regions where futher exploration and data collection should be performed.</description>
