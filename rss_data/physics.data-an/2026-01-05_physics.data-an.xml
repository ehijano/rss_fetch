      <title>Setting limits on blazar-boosted dark matter with xenon-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity for dark matter in the 10 to 1000 GeV/c$^2$ mass range, but sub-GeV dark matter particles lack sufficient energy to produce nuclear recoils above detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a way to overcome this limitation. Relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies that can leave detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search that incorporates detector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS 0506+056. We model dark matter-proton scattering in the jet environment, covering the full process from jet acceleration through to detector response, and we explore how the host-galaxy dark matter density profile impacts the analysis. We set model-dependent exclusion regions on the dark-matter-nucleon scattering cross section for m$_{\chi}$ approximately 1 MeV dark matter, between 5.8$\times 10^{-31}$ cm$^2$ and 6.3$\times 10^{-29}$cm$^2$ using XENON1T data, and between 9.9$\times 10^{-32}$ cm$^2$ and 2.5$\times 10^{-28}$ cm$^2$ from LZ effective field theory (EFT) dark matter searches. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties, especially those in the dark-matter distribution near the supermassive black hole, are the main limitation of this search rather than detector effects. The limits are therefore model-dependent and should be seen as exploratory, highlighting both the potential and the present uncertainties of blazar-boosted dark matter as a probe of light dark matter.</description>

      <title>Resolution and Robustness Bounds for Reconstructive Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructive spectrometers are a promising emerging class of devices that combine complex light scattering with inference to enable compact, high-resolution spectrometry. Thus far, the physical determinants of these devices' performance remain under-explored. We show that under a broad range of conditions, the noise-induced error for spectral reconstruction is governed by the Fisher information. We then use random matrix theory to derive a closed-form relation linking the variance bound to a set of key physical parameters: the spectral correlation length, the mean transmittance, and the number of frequency and measurement channels. The analysis reveals certain fundamental trade-offs between these physical parameters, and establishes the conditions for a spectrometer to achieve ``super-resolution'' below the limit set by the spectral correlation length. Our theory is confirmed using numerical validations with a random matrix model as well as full-wave simulations. These results establish a physically-grounded framework for designing and analyzing performant and noise-robust reconstructive spectrometers.</description>
