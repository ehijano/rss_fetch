      <title>Characterization of multipliers on vector-valued Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work characterizes the multipliers on vector-valued Hardy spaces over the infinite polydisk and the infinite polytorus, as well as in the context of Dirichlet series. Unlike the scalar-valued setting, where these frameworks are completely analogous reformulations of one another, there are significant differences in the vector-valued context. We prove that while the space of multipliers on the infinite polydisk is $H_\infty(\mathbb{D}^\infty_2, B(X))$, the situation on the infinite polytorus is distinct; assuming $X$ is separable, the multiplier space can be identified as $H_\infty^{sot}(\mathbb{T}^\infty, B(X))$, consisting of essentially bounded SOT-measurable functions. These spaces coincide when $X$ possesses the analytic Radon-Nikodym property. Finally, we extend these results to the associated Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series, $\mathcal{H}_p^+(X)$ and $\mathcal{H}_p(X)$, providing characterizations for their respective multiplier spaces.</description>

      <title>A Proper Closed Subspace of the Lipschitz Dual Containing the Linear Dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by classical results of Lindenstrauss and recent developments by Karn and Mandal, we investigate quotient spaces of the form $Lip_0(X)/\mathcal{A}$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a finite-dimensional subspace, showing that these quotients are dual spaces with explicitly describable preduals.
  We then focus on $Lip_0^{ph}(X)$, the space of positively homogeneous real-valued Lipschitz functions. This space satisfies $
X^* \subsetneq Lip_0^{ph}(X) \subsetneq Lip_0(X), $
and is shown to be both a dual space and the preannihilator of a closed subspace of the Lipschitz-free space. Consequently it follows that $\bigslant{Lip_0(X)}{Lip_0^{ph}(X)}$ is also a dual space. Furthermore, with a suitable multiplication, $(Lip_0^{ph}(X), Lip(\cdot))$ forms a Banach algebra, exhibiting structural advantages over $Lip_0(X)$.</description>

      <title>Frames for compactly supported functions with irrational density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find sufficient conditions on a compactly supported function $g$, $\supp g = [a,b]$ which guarantee that the Gabor system $$\mathcal{G}(g;\alpha,\beta)=\{e^{2\pi i \beta m x}g(x-\alpha n)\}_{m,n\in\mathbb{Z}}$$ is a frame for all $\alpha &lt; b-a, \alpha\beta &lt; 1, \alpha\beta \notin\Q$. These conditions are on one hand satisfied by almost all such functions, and on the other hand are explicit enough that we can give many concrete examples of the functions $g$ which give us a frame e.g. $g(x) = \exp(\frac{1}{x^4-1})\chi_{(-1,1)}(x)$.</description>

      <title>Octonionic Para-linear Self-Adjoint Operators and Spectral Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a groundbreaking advancement in the theory of operators defined on octonionic Hilbert spaces, successfully resolving a fundamental challenge that has persisted for over six decades. Due to the intrinsic non-associative nature of octonions, conventional linear operator theory encounters profound structural difficulties. We make use of an original conceptual framework termed para-linearity, an innovative generalization of linearity that naturally accommodates the octonionic algebraic structure. Within this newly established paradigm, we systematically develop an appropriate algebraic setting by defining a carefully designed operator algebra and an adjoint operation which, together, recapture essential analytic properties previously inaccessible in this context. We identify a geometric structure, the slice cone, as the fundamental object encoding spectral properties typically derived through sesquilinear forms. We obtain a rigorous characterization of self-adjointness which indicates how to introduce a new notion of strong eigenvalues. For every compact, para-linear, self-adjoint operator with strong eigenvalues, we can establish the spectral decomposition theorem and functional calculi.</description>

      <title>Shorting Dynamics and Structured Kernel Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a nonlinear operator dynamic that progressively removes the influence of a prescribed feature subspace while retaining maximal structure elsewhere. The induced sequence of positive operators is monotone, admits an exact residual decomposition, and converges to the classical shorted operator. Transporting this dynamic to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces yields a corresponding family of kernels that converges to the largest kernel dominated by the original one and annihilating the given subspace. In the finite-sample setting, the associated Gram operators inherit a structured residual decomposition that leads to a canonical form of kernel ridge regression and a principled way to enforce nuisance invariance. This gives a unified operator-analytic approach to invariant kernel construction and structured regularization in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Next-order asymptotics for the volume of Schatten balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volume of the unit balls of self-adjoint finite-dimensional Schatten $p$-classes of $n\times n$-matrices, $1\le p\le \infty$, is only known exactly for $p=2$ and $p=\infty$. We give an asymptotic expansion of the logarithmic volume to order $o(n)$ for general $p\ge\frac{3}{2}$. The proof rests on asymptotics for the partition function of $\beta$-ensembles due to Lebl\'e and Serfaty [Invent. Math. 210(3):645--757, 2017]. Independently, the case $p\ge 2$ was obtained by Dworaczek Guera, Memin and Pain [arXiv:2511.05386]. In the complex case the asymptotic expansion is continued to order $O(1)$ for all $p\ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Nehari-Schauder type fixed point results and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a fixed point version of the well-known Nehari manifold method from critical point theory. The main result is formulated for systems of operator equations, relying on the fixed point theorems of Schauder and Schaefer. The framework also allows for potential extensions combining our Nehari type approach with other fixed point principles. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, an example involving a system of nonlinear integral equations is provided.</description>

      <title>An elementary approach to Wehrl-type entropy bounds in quantitative form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the stability (with sharp exponent) of the Lieb--Solovej inequality for symmetric $SU(N)$ coherent states, which was obtained only recently by the authors. Here, we propose an elementary proof of this result, based on reformulating the Wehrl-type entropy as a function defined on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^d$, for some suitable $d$, and on some explicit (and somewhat surprising) computations.</description>

      <title>The operator layer cake theorem is equivalent to Frenkel's integral formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operator layer cake theorem provides an integral representation for the directional derivative of the operator logarithm in terms of a family of projections [arXiv:2507.06232]. Recently, the related work [arXiv:2507.07065] showed that the theorem gives an alternative proof to Frenkel's integral formula for Umegaki's relative entropy [Quantum, 7:1102 (2023)]. In this short note, we find a converse implication, demonstrating that the operator layer cake theorem is equivalent to Frenkel's integral formula.</description>

      <title>Constructive Approximation under Carleman's Condition, with Applications to Smoothed Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical result of Carleman, based on the theory of quasianalytic functions, shows that polynomials are dense in $L^2(\mu)$ for any $\mu$ such that the moments $\int x^k d\mu$ do not grow too rapidly as $k \to \infty$. In this work, we develop a fairly tight quantitative analogue of the underlying Denjoy-Carleman theorem via complex analysis, and show that this allows for nonasymptotic control of the rate of approximation by polynomials for any smooth function with polynomial growth at infinity. In many cases, this allows us to establish $L^2$ approximation-theoretic results for functions over general classes of distributions (e.g., multivariate sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential distributions) which were previously known only in special cases. As one application, we show that the Paley--Wiener class of functions bandlimited to $[-\Omega,\Omega]$ admits superexponential rates of approximation over all strictly sub-exponential distributions, which leads to a new characterization of the class. As another application, we solve an open problem recently posed by Chandrasekaran, Klivans, Kontonis, Meka and Stavropoulos on the smoothed analysis of learning, and also obtain quantitative improvements to their main results and applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized Navier-Stokes equations, associated with the Dolbeault complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem in the band $\mathbb{C}^{n}\times[0, T], n&gt;1,T&gt;0$, for a system of nonlinear differential equations structurally similar to the classical Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid. The main difference of this system is that it is generated not by the standard gradient operators $\nabla$, divergence div and rotor rot, but by the multidimensional Cauchy-Riemann operator $\overline{\partial}$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, its formally adjoint operator $\overline{\partial}^{*}$ and the compatibility complex for $\overline{\partial}$, which is usually called the Dolbeault complex. The similarity of the structure makes it possible to prove for this problem the theorem of the existence of weak solutions and the open mapping theorem on the scale of specially constructed Bochner-Sobolev spaces. In addition, a criterion for the existence of a ``strong'' solution in these spaces is obtained.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory of Krein-Feller Type Operators and Applications in Stochastic Fractional Elliptic and Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that the space $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$, introduced in Simas and Sousa (Potential Analysis, 2025), is the natural regularity space for solutions of the eigenvalue problem $\Delta_{W,V} u = \lambda u$ on the torus $\mathbb{T}$, where $\Delta_{W,V} = \frac{d^{+}}{dV}\frac{d^{-}}{dW}$ is the Krein Feller operator in the case where $W$ and $V$ are strictly increasing and right continuous (respectively left continuous), possibly with dense sets of discontinuities. In this work we provide conditions ensuring that every function in $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$, which may be highly discontinuous, admits a series expansion that generalizes the classical Taylor expansion. A central feature of our approach is that all proofs are nonstandard, since classical analytical and spectral arguments cannot be adapted to this singular setting. Using these methods we characterize the eigenvectors of $\Delta_{W,V}$ in terms of generalized trigonometric functions and obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the associated eigenvalues. We also derive a sharp upper bound for the convergence exponent of these eigenvalues, and as a consequence we prove that $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$ is a nuclear space. Further consequences include results on the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of compact operators and improvements in traceability. As a final application we establish existence results for generalized fractional stochastic and deterministic differential equations, as well as for parabolic stochastic partial differential equations acting on nuclear spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the contraction properties of $p$-Wasserstein distances with respect to convolution in Euclidean spaces both qualitatively and quantitatively. We connect this question to the question of uniform convexity of the Kantorovich functional on which there was substantial recent progress (mostly for $p=2$ and partially for $p&gt;1$). Motivated by this connection we extend these uniform convexity results to the case $p=1$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend the Nehari manifold method from the variational setting to the nonvariational framework of fixed point equations. This is achieved by constructing a radial energy functional that generalizes the standard one from the variational case. Furthermore, the solutions obtained through our method are localized in conical annular sets, which leads to the existence of multiple solutions. The abstract results are illustrated by two representative applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies probabilistic dual frames and the associated dual frame potentials from the perspective of optimal mass transport. The main contribution of this work shows that given a probabilistic frame, its associated dual frame potential is minimized if and only if the probabilistic frame is tight and the probabilistic dual frame is the canonical dual. In particular, the tightness condition can be dropped if the probabilistic dual frame potential is minimized only among probabilistic dual frames of pushforward type.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the isometric structure of $L^{p}$-spaces for the infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure $(\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}},\mu)$. Under the continuum hypothesis (CH) we prove $L^{p}(\mu)\cong \ell^{p}(\mathfrak{c},L^{p}[0,1])$, where $\mathfrak{c}$ denotes the cardinality of the continuum, and without CH we obtain an isometric, complemented copy of $\ell^{p}(\mathfrak{c},L^{p}[0,1])$ inside $L^{p}(\mu)$. In a general framework, we characterize precisely when $L^{p}(\nu)\cong \ell^{p}(\kappa,L^{p}[0,1])$ and classify all such isometries.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Sobolev norms for Kolmogorov operators with scaling-critical drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the ordinary or fractional Laplacian plus a homogeneous, scaling-critical drift term. This operator is non-symmetric but homogeneous, and generates scales of $L^p$-Sobolev spaces which we compare with the ordinary homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Unlike in previous studies concerning Hardy operators, i.e., ordinary or fractional Laplacians plus scaling-critical scalar perturbations, handling the drift term requires an additional, possibly technical, restriction on the range of comparable Sobolev spaces, which is related to the unavailability of gradient bounds for the associated semigroup.</description>

      <title>Banach Poisson-Lie groups, Lax equations and the AKS theorem in infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the theory of $R$-brackets, Baxter brackets and Nijenhuis brackets in the Banach setting, in particular in relation with Banach Poisson-Lie groups. The notion of Banach Lie-Poisson space with respect to an arbitrary duality pairing is crucial for the equations of motion to make sense. In the presence of a non-degenerate invariant pairing on a Banach Lie algebra, these equations of motion assume a Lax form. We prove a version of the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem adapted to $R$-matrices on infinite-dimensional Banach algebras. Applications to the resolution of Lax equations associated to some Banach Manin triples are given. The semi-infinite Toda lattice is also presented as an example of this approach.</description>
