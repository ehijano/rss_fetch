      <title>DSRAG: A Domain-Specific Retrieval Framework Based on Document-derived Multimodal Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current general-purpose large language models (LLMs) commonly exhibit knowledge hallucination and insufficient domain-specific adaptability in domain-specific tasks, limiting their effectiveness in specialized question answering scenarios. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively tackles these challenges by integrating external knowledge to enhance accuracy and relevance. However, traditional RAG still faces limitations in domain knowledge accuracy and context modeling.To enhance domain-specific question answering performance, this work focuses on a graph-based RAG framework, emphasizing the critical role of knowledge graph quality during the generation process. We propose DSRAG (Domain-Specific RAG), a multimodal knowledge graph-driven retrieval-augmented generation framework designed for domain-specific applications. Our approach leverages domain-specific documents as the primary knowledge source, integrating heterogeneous information such as text, images, and tables to construct a multimodal knowledge graph covering both conceptual and instance layers. Building on this foundation, we introduce semantic pruning and structured subgraph retrieval mechanisms, combining knowledge graph context and vector retrieval results to guide the language model towards producing more reliable responses. Evaluations using the Langfuse multidimensional scoring mechanism show that our method excels in domain-specific question answering, validating the efficacy of integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation.</description>

      <title>Learning Decomposed Contextual Token Representations from Pretrained and Collaborative Signals for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative recommenders adopt a two-stage paradigm: items are first tokenized into semantic IDs using a pretrained tokenizer, and then large language models (LLMs) are trained to generate the next item via sequence-to-sequence modeling. However, these two stages are optimized for different objectives: semantic reconstruction during tokenizer pretraining versus user interaction modeling during recommender training. This objective misalignment leads to two key limitations: (i) suboptimal static tokenization, where fixed token assignments fail to reflect diverse usage contexts; and (ii) discarded pretrained semantics, where pretrained knowledge - typically from language model embeddings - is overwritten during recommender training on user interactions. To address these limitations, we propose to learn DEcomposed COntextual Token Representations (DECOR), a unified framework that preserves pretrained semantics while enhancing the adaptability of token embeddings. DECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings based on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that integrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DECOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation performance. Our code will be made available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Real-Time RAG for the Identification of Supply Chain Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New technologies in generative AI can enable deeper analysis into our nation's supply chains but truly informative insights require the continual updating and aggregation of massive data in a timely manner. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their knowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering these capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on emerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach to supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping technologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new information into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain disruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial effects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our results suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis, fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most significant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of retrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts retrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on complex supply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited improvements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query abstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice.</description>

      <title>ReFineG: Synergizing Small Supervised Models and LLMs for Low-Resource Grounded Multimodal NER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) extends traditional NER by jointly detecting textual mentions and grounding them to visual regions. While existing supervised methods achieve strong performance, they rely on costly multimodal annotations and often underperform in low-resource domains. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong generalization but suffer from Domain Knowledge Conflict, producing redundant or incorrect mentions for domain-specific entities. To address these challenges, we propose ReFineG, a three-stage collaborative framework that integrates small supervised models with frozen MLLMs for low-resource GMNER. In the Training Stage, a domain-aware NER data synthesis strategy transfers LLM knowledge to small models with supervised training while avoiding domain knowledge conflicts. In the Refinement Stage, an uncertainty-based mechanism retains confident predictions from supervised models and delegates uncertain ones to the MLLM. In the Grounding Stage, a multimodal context selection algorithm enhances visual grounding through analogical reasoning. In the CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task, ReFineG ranked second with an F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard, demonstrating its effectiveness with limited annotations.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks on Recommender System: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have been widely applied to various applications, including E-commerce, finance, healthcare, social media and have become increasingly influential in shaping user behavior and decision-making, highlighting their growing impact in various domains. However, recent studies have shown that RecSys are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether user interaction record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on RecSys models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a purchase record that has been used to train a RecSys associated with a specific user, an attacker can infer that user's special quirks. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on other ML tasks, e.g., classification models and natural language processing. However, traditional MIAs are ill-suited for RecSys due to the unseen posterior probability. Although MIAs on RecSys form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on RecSys MIAs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in RecSys MIAs, exploring the design principles, challenges, attack and defense associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different RecSys MIAs based on their characterizations and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain.</description>

      <title>SPARK: Adaptive Low-Rank Knowledge Graph Modeling in Hybrid Geometric Spaces for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enhance recommender systems but face challenges from inherent noise, sparsity, and Euclidean geometry's inadequacy for complex relational structures, critically impairing representation learning, especially for long-tail entities. Existing methods also often lack adaptive multi-source signal fusion tailored to item popularity. This paper introduces SPARK, a novel multi-stage framework systematically tackling these issues. SPARK first employs Tucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity representations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN concurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the latter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical structures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items. A core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that dynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG embeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both mainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these multi-source representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPARK's significant superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in improving long-tail item recommendation, offering a robust, principled approach to knowledge-enhanced recommendation. Implementation code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SPARK.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Information Cocoon: A Multidimensional Assessment and Analysis of News Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized news recommendation systems inadvertently create information cocoons--homogeneous information bubbles that reinforce user biases and amplify societal polarization. To address the lack of comprehensive assessment frameworks in prior research, we propose a multidimensional analysis that evaluates cocoons through dual perspectives: (1) Individual homogenization via topic diversity (including the number of topic categories and category information entropy) and click repetition; (2) Group polarization via network density and community openness. Through multi-round experiments on real-world datasets, we benchmark seven algorithms and reveal critical insights. Furthermore, we design five lightweight mitigation strategies. This work establishes the first unified metric framework for information cocoons and delivers deployable solutions for ethical recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Favor Recent Content? A Study on Recency Bias in LLM-Based Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in information systems, including being used as second-stage rerankers in information retrieval pipelines, yet their susceptibility to recency bias has received little attention. We investigate whether LLMs implicitly favour newer documents by prepending artificial publication dates to passages in the TREC Deep Learning passage retrieval collections in 2021 (DL21) and 2022 (DL22). Across seven models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, GPT-4, LLaMA-3 8B/70B, and Qwen-2.5 7B/72B, "fresh" passages are consistently promoted, shifting the Top-10's mean publication year forward by up to 4.78 years and moving individual items by as many as 95 ranks in our listwise reranking experiments. Although larger models attenuate the effect, none eliminate it. We also observe that the preference of LLMs between two passages with an identical relevance level can be reversed by up to 25% on average after date injection in our pairwise preference experiments. These findings provide quantitative evidence of a pervasive recency bias in LLMs and highlight the importance of effective bias-mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Decoding in Latent Spaces for Efficient Inference in LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for recommendation in a generative manner has delivered promising results, but encounters significant inference overhead due to autoregressive decoding in the language space. This work explores bypassing language-space decoding by directly matching candidate items with the LLM's internal thought representations in the latent space, eliminating the time-consuming autoregressive process to reduce computational costs. Towards this, we introduce Light Latent-space Decoding (L2D), an effective and efficient latent-space decoding method. L2D represents user-preferred items by using the hidden states of test sequences reflecting the LLM's internal thought, and obtains candidate item representations from the hidden states of training sequences labeled with the corresponding candidate items. It then matches the two types of representations to decode items, achieving latent-space decoding. In this way, it enables efficient decoding without altering the LLM's generative tuning paradigm, thereby preserving performance. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that L2D is more than 10x faster than language-space decoding while maintaining or enhancing performance.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Analysis of Text-Conditioned AI-Generated Music: A Case Study with Suno and Udio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online AI platforms for creating music from text prompts (AI music), such as Suno and Udio, are now being used by hundreds of thousands of users. Some AI music is appearing in advertising, and even charting, in multiple countries. How are these platforms being used? What subjects are inspiring their users? This article answers these questions for Suno and Udio using a large collection of songs generated by users of these platforms from May to October 2024. Using a combination of state-of-the-art text embedding models, dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, we analyze the prompts, tags and lyrics, and automatically annotate and display the processed data in interactive plots. Our results reveal prominent themes in lyrics, language preference, prompting strategies, as well as peculiar attempts at steering models through the use of metatags. To promote the musicological study of the developing cultural practice of AI-generated music we share our code and resources.</description>

      <title>AEFS: Adaptive Early Feature Selection for Deep Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection has emerged as a crucial technique in refining recommender systems. Recent advancements leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has drawn significant attention, particularly in two main categories: early feature selection and late feature selection, differentiated by whether the selection occurs before or after the embedding layer. The early feature selection selects a fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature selection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature choices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature significance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable improvements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer feature selection. This process often becomes cumbersome and inefficient in large-scale recommender systems with billions of ID-type features, leading to a highly sparse and parameter-heavy embedding layer. To overcome this, we introduce Adaptive Early Feature Selection (AEFS), a very simple method that not only adaptively selects informative features for each instance, but also significantly reduces the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS employs a dual-model architecture, encompassing an auxiliary model dedicated to feature selection and a main model responsible for prediction. To ensure effective alignment between these two models, we incorporate two collaborative training loss constraints. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Notably, AEFS matches the performance of current state-of-theart Adaptive Late Feature Selection methods while achieving a significant reduction of 37. 5% in the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS is open-source at https://github. com/fly-dragon211/AEFS .</description>

      <title>Decentralized Identity Management on Ripple: A Conceptual Framework for High-Speed, Low-Cost Identity Transactions in Attestation-Based Attribute-Based Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen many industrial implementations and much scholastic research, i.e., prototypes and theoretical frameworks, in Decentralized Identity Management Systems (DIDMS). It is safe to say that Attestation-Based Attribute-Based Decentralized IDM (ABABDIDM) has not received anywhere near the same level of attention in the literature as general Attribute-Based DIDMs (ABDIDM), i.e, decentralized Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). The use of decentralization, i.e., DIDM, is to improve upon the security and privacy-related issues of centralized Identity Management Systems (IDM) and Attribute-Based IDMs (ABIDM). And blockchain is the framework used for decentralization in all these schemes. Many DIDMs - even ABDIDMs - have been defined on popular blockchains such as Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. However, despite the characteristics of Ripple that makes it appealing for an ABIDM, there is a lack of research to develop an Identity Management System (IDMS) on Ripple in literature. We have attempted to conceptualize an ABABDIDM on Ripple.</description>

      <title>RanAT4BIE: Random Adversarial Training for Biomedical Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce random adversarial training (RAT), a novel framework successfully applied to biomedical information extraction (BioIE) tasks. Building on PubMedBERT as the foundational architecture, our study first validates the effectiveness of conventional adversarial training in enhancing pre-trained language models' performance on BioIE tasks. While adversarial training yields significant improvements across various performance metrics, it also introduces considerable computational overhead. To address this limitation, we propose RAT as an efficiency solution for biomedical information extraction. This framework strategically integrates random sampling mechanisms with adversarial training principles, achieving dual objectives: enhanced model generalization and robustness while significantly reducing computational costs. Through comprehensive evaluations, RAT demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models in BioIE tasks. The results highlight RAT's potential as a transformative framework for biomedical natural language processing, offering a balanced solution to the model performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>An Incentive-Compatible Reward Sharing Mechanism for Mitigating Mirroring Attacks in Decentralized Data-Feed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized data-feed systems enable blockchain-based smart contracts to access off-chain information by aggregating values from multiple oracles. To improve accuracy, these systems typically use an aggregation function, such as majority voting, to consolidate the inputs they receive from oracles and make a decision. Depending on the final decision and the values reported by the oracles, the participating oracles are compensated through shared rewards. However, such incentive mechanisms are vulnerable to mirroring attacks, where a single user controls multiple oracles to bias the decision of the aggregation function and maximize rewards. This paper analyzes the impact of mirroring attacks on the reliability and dependability of majority voting-based data-feed systems. We demonstrate how existing incentive mechanisms can unintentionally encourage rational users to implement such attacks. To address this, we propose a new incentive mechanism that discourages Sybil behavior. We prove that the proposed mechanism leads to a Nash Equilibrium in which each user operates only one oracle. Finally, we discuss the practical implementation of the proposed incentive mechanism and provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Overspecification in Electronic Dance Music Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic Dance Music (EDM) classification typically relies on industry-defined taxonomies with numerous subgenres, yet the acoustic basis for these distinctions remains unclear. Current approaches use supervised learning with prescribed genre labels, assuming their validity without systematic evaluation. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to discover the natural acoustic structure of EDM independent of commercial labels. Our method combines novel tempogram-based features capturing EDM's layered rhythmic patterns with multi-criteria feature selection. To validate that our findings reflect genuine acoustic structure rather than methodological artifacts, we compare our results against state-of-the-art pre-trained audio embeddings (MERT and CLAP). Both our feature space and embedding representations converge to 19-23 natural acoustic families compared to the prescribed 35, providing consistent evidence of significant overspecification in current EDM taxonomy by approximately one-third.</description>

      <title>SAQ: Pushing the Limits of Vector Quantization through Code Adjustment and Dimension Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a critical role in applications such as search engines, recommender systems, and RAG for LLMs. Vector quantization (VQ), a crucial technique for ANNS, is commonly used to reduce space overhead and accelerate distance computations. However, despite significant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face challenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve accuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically partition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By prioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates more bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space quota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize dimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error. To speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first quantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized vectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive enumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical methods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ, Extended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and accelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nano-machines circulating inside the human body, collecting data on tissue conditions, represent a vital part of next-generation medical diagnostic systems. However, for these devices to operate effectively, they need to relay not only their medical measurements but also their positions. This paper introduces a novel localization method for in-body nano-machines based on the magnetic field, leveraging the advantageous magnetic permeability of all human tissues. The entire proposed localization system is described, starting from 10 um x 10 um magnetometers to be integrated into the nano-machines, to a set of external wires generating the magnetic field. Mathematical equations for the localization algorithm are also provided, assuming the nano-machines do not execute the computations themselves, but transmit their magnetic field measurements together with medical data outside of the body. The whole system is validated with computer simulations that capture the measurement error of the magnetometers, the error induced by the Earth magnetic field, and a human body model assuming different possible positions of nano-machines. The results show a very high system accuracy with position errors even below 1 cm.</description>

      <title>CROSSAN: Towards Efficient and Effective Adaptation of Multiple Multimodal Foundation Models for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a less-studied yet practically important problem: how to efficiently and effectively adapt multiple ($&gt;$2) multimodal foundation models (MFMs) for the sequential recommendation task. To this end, we propose a plug-and-play Cross-modal Side Adapter Network (CROSSAN), which leverages a fully decoupled side adapter-based paradigm to achieve efficient and scalable adaptation. Compared to the state-of-the-art efficient approaches, CROSSAN reduces training time by over 30%, GPU memory consumption by 20%, and trainable parameters by over 57%, while enabling effective cross-modal learning across diverse modalities. To further enhance multimodal fusion, we introduce the Mixture of Modality Expert Fusion (MOMEF) mechanism. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that CROSSAN consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 6.7%--8.1% performance improvements when adapting four foundation models with raw modalities. Moreover, the overall performance continues to improve as more MFMs are incorporated. We will release our code and datasets to faciliate future research.</description>

      <title>Rethinking LLM-Based Recommendations: A Personalized Query-Driven Parallel Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating large language models (LLMs) into recommendation systems but face several challenges, including training-induced bias and bottlenecks from serialized architecture. To effectively address these issues, we propose a Query-toRecommendation, a parallel recommendation framework that decouples LLMs from candidate pre-selection and instead enables direct retrieval over the entire item pool. Our framework connects LLMs and recommendation models in a parallel manner, allowing each component to independently utilize its strengths without interfering with the other. In this framework, LLMs are utilized to generate feature-enriched item descriptions and personalized user queries, allowing for capturing diverse preferences and enabling rich semantic matching in a zero-shot manner. To effectively combine the complementary strengths of LLM and collaborative signals, we introduce an adaptive reranking strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate an improvement in performance up to 57%, while also improving the novelty and diversity of recommendations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing CTR Prediction with De-correlated Expert Networks</title>

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions is essential for accurate click-through rate (CTR) prediction in advertising systems. Recent studies have adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach to improve performance by ensembling multiple feature interaction experts. These studies employ various strategies, such as learning independent embedding tables for each expert or utilizing heterogeneous expert architectures, to differentiate the experts, which we refer to expert de-correlation. However, it remains unclear whether these strategies effectively achieve de-correlated experts. To address this, we propose a De-Correlated MoE (D-MoE) framework, which introduces a Cross-Expert De-Correlation loss to minimize expert correlations.Additionally, we propose a novel metric, termed Cross-Expert Correlation, to quantitatively evaluate the expert de-correlation degree. Based on this metric, we identify a key finding for MoE framework design: different de-correlation strategies are mutually compatible, and progressively employing them leads to reduced correlation and enhanced performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of D-MoE and the de-correlation principle. Moreover, online A/B testing on Tencent's advertising platforms demonstrates that D-MoE achieves a significant 1.19% Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) lift compared to the Multi-Embedding MoE baseline.</description>

Abstract: Recommender systems have been widely used in various large-scale user-oriented platforms for many years. However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios.
  To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale recommendation system with significant real-world impact.</description>

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have transformed recommender systems through end-to-end generation. OneRec reformulates recommendation as an autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning relying solely on reward models.
  To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions: Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to better align with user preferences using real-world feedback.
  Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness, improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the development of end-to-end recommender systems.</description>

      <title>OneSearch: A Preliminary Exploration of the Unified End-to-End Generative Framework for E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose \textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE) module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\% item CTR, +2.40\% buyer, and +3.22\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces operational expenditure by 75.40\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from 3.26\% to 27.32\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of millions of PVs daily.</description>

Abstract: GeoGPT is an open large language model system built to advance research in the geosciences. To enhance its domain-specific capabilities, we integrated Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG), which augments model outputs with relevant information retrieved from an external knowledge source. GeoGPT uses RAG to draw from the GeoGPT Library, a specialized corpus curated for geoscientific content, enabling it to generate accurate, context-specific answers. Users can also create personalized knowledge bases by uploading their own publication lists, allowing GeoGPT to retrieve and respond using user-provided materials. To further improve retrieval quality and domain alignment, we fine-tuned both the embedding model and a ranking model that scores retrieved passages by relevance to the query. These enhancements optimize RAG for geoscience applications and significantly improve the system's ability to deliver precise and trustworthy outputs. GeoGPT reflects a strong commitment to open science through its emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and community driven development. As part of this commitment, we have open-sourced two core RAG components-GeoEmbedding and GeoReranker-to support geoscientists, researchers, and professionals worldwide with powerful, accessible AI tools.</description>

      <title>FM2DS: Few-Shot Multimodal Multihop Data Synthesis with Knowledge Distillation for Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07030v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal multihop question answering (MMQA) requires reasoning over images and text from multiple sources. Despite advances in visual question answering, this multihop setting remains underexplored due to a lack of quality datasets. Existing methods focus on single-hop, single-modality, or short texts, limiting real-world applications like interpreting educational documents with long, multimodal content. To fill this gap, we introduce FM2DS, the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset for MMQA. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure data quality. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks: MultimodalQA and WebQA. Our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) score on average. Additionally, we introduce M2QA-Bench with 1k samples, the first benchmark for MMQA on long documents, generated using FM2DS and refined by human annotators. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating MMQA models.</description>

      <title>Graceful forgetting: Memory as a process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rational framework is proposed to explain how we accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded memory. Memory is stored as statistics organized into structures that are repeatedly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. Repeated summarization requires an intensive ongoing process guided by heuristics that help optimize the memory for future needs. Sensory input is rapidly encoded as simple statistics that are progressively elaborated into more abstract constructs. This framework differs from previous accounts of memory by its emphasis on a process that is intensive, complex, and expensive, its reliance on statistics as a representation of memory, and the use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics at each summarization step. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.</description>

      <title>Burger: Robust Graph Denoising-augmentation Fusion and Multi-semantic Modeling in Social Recommendation</title>

Abstract: In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>ConvSearch-R1: Enhancing Query Reformulation for Conversational Search with Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational search systems require effective handling of context-dependent queries that often contain ambiguity, omission, and coreference. Conversational Query Reformulation (CQR) addresses this challenge by transforming these queries into self-contained forms suitable for off-the-shelf retrievers. However, existing CQR approaches suffer from two critical constraints: high dependency on costly external supervision from human annotations or large language models, and insufficient alignment between the rewriting model and downstream retrievers. We present ConvSearch-R1, the first self-driven framework that completely eliminates dependency on external rewrite supervision by leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize reformulation directly through retrieval signals. Our novel two-stage approach combines Self-Driven Policy Warm-Up to address the cold-start problem through retrieval-guided self-distillation, followed by Retrieval-Guided Reinforcement Learning with a specially designed rank-incentive reward shaping mechanism that addresses the sparsity issue in conventional retrieval metrics. Extensive experiments on TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that ConvSearch-R1 significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvement on the challenging TopiOCQA dataset while using smaller 3B parameter models without any external supervision.</description>

      <title>PDFMathTranslate: Scientific Document Translation Preserving Layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language barriers in scientific documents hinder the diffusion and development of science and technologies. However, prior efforts in translating such documents largely overlooked the information in layouts. To bridge the gap, we introduce PDFMathTranslate, the world's first open-source software for translating scientific documents while preserving layouts. Leveraging the most recent advances in large language models and precise layout detection, we contribute to the community with key improvements in precision, flexibility, and efficiency. The work has been open-sourced at https://github.com/byaidu/pdfmathtranslate with more than 222k downloads.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable and Interpretable Document Question Answering via VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document understanding, particularly in identifying and extracting textual information from complex documents. Despite this, accurately localizing answers within documents remains a major challenge, limiting both interpretability and real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce DocExplainerV0, a plug-and-play bounding-box prediction module that decouples answer generation from spatial localization. This design makes it applicable to existing VLMs, including proprietary systems where fine-tuning is not feasible. Through systematic evaluation, we provide quantitative insights into the gap between textual accuracy and spatial grounding, showing that correct answers often lack reliable localization. Our standardized framework highlights these shortcomings and establishes a benchmark for future research toward more interpretable and robust document information extraction VLMs.</description>
