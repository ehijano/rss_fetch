      <title>Comparing angles in Euclid's Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exposition in Euclid's Elements contains an obvious gap (seemingly unnoticed by most commentators): he often compares not just angles, but *groups* of angles, and at the same time he avoids summing angles (and considering angles greater than $\pi$), and does not say what such a comparison of groups could mean. We discuss the problem and suggest a possible interpretation that could make Euclid's exposition consistent.</description>

      <title>A camel with a less strict diet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A camel can carry $B$ bananas on its back. It can have $2$ bananas at a time in its stomach. For each mile the camel walks, the amount of bananas in its stomach decreases $1$. As soon as the amount of bananas in the camel's stomach is at most $1$, it can eat a new banana. When the camel's stomach is empty, the camel must eat a new banana (in order to be able to continue its itinerary).
  Let there be a stock of $N$ bananas at the border of the desert. How far can the camel penetrate into the desert, starting at this point? (Of course it can form new stocks with transported bananas.)
  The case $B=1$ is solved completely. The round trip variant is solved for $B=1$ as well. For $B=2$, the round trip variant is solved for $N$ which are a power of $2$ and $N \le 8$, and estimated up to $1/(N-1)$ miles for general $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1009.2938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem `Exploring Mount Neverest' by Henry Ernest Dudeney is solved. Dudeney formulated the problem in the beginning of the 20th century and gave a non-optimal solution (without estimating the non-optimality).</description>

      <title>The Camel-Banana Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A camel can carry one banana at a time on its back. It is on a diet and therefore can only have one banana at a time in its stomach. As soon as it has eaten a banana it walks a mile and then it needs a new banana (in order to be able to continue its itinerary). Let there be a stock of N bananas at the border of the desert. How far can the camel penetrate into the desert, starting at this point? (Of course it can form new stocks with transported bananas.)</description>

      <title>The Brioschi Formula for the Gaussian Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Brioschi formula expresses the Gaussian curvature $K$ in terms of the functions $E, F$ and $G$ in local coordinates of a surface $S$. This implies the Gauss' theorema egregium, which says that the Gaussian curvature just depends on angles, distances, and their rates of change.
  In most of the textbooks, the Gauss' theorema egregium was proved as a corollary to the derivation of the Gauss equations, a set of equations expressing $EK, FK$ and $GK$ in terms of the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols can be expressed in terms of $E$, $F$ and $G$. In principle, one can derive the Brioschi formula from the Gauss equations after some tedious calculations.
  In this note, we give a direct elementary proof of the Brioschi formula without using Christoffel symbols. The key to the proof are properties of matrices and determinants.</description>
