      <title>Two fitness inference schemes compared using allele frequencies from 1,068,391 sequences sampled in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic</title>

Abstract: Throughout the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, genetic variation has contributed to the spread and persistence of the virus. For example, various mutations have allowed SARS-CoV-2 to escape antibody neutralization or to bind more strongly to the receptors that it uses to enter human cells. Here, we compared two methods that estimate the fitness effects of viral mutations using the abundant sequence data gathered over the course of the pandemic. Both approaches are grounded in population genetics theory but with different assumptions. One approach, tQLE, features an epistatic fitness landscape and assumes that alleles are nearly in linkage equilibrium. Another approach, MPL, assumes a simple, additive fitness landscape, but allows for any level of correlation between alleles. We characterized differences in the distributions of fitness values inferred by each approach and in the ranks of fitness values that they assign to sequences across time. We find that in a large fraction of weeks the two methods are in good agreement as to their top-ranked sequences, i.e., as to which sequences observed that week are most fit. We also find that agreement between ranking of sequences varies with genetic unimodality in the population in a given week.</description>

      <title>Counting cherry reduction sequences is counting linear extensions (in phylogenetic tree-child networks)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orchard and tree-child networks share an important property with phylogenetic trees: they can be completely reduced to a single node by iteratively deleting cherries and reticulated cherries. As it is the case with phylogenetic trees, the number of ways in which this can be done gives information about the topology of the network. Here, we show that the problem of computing this number in tree-child networks is akin to that of finding the number of linear extensions of the poset induced by each network, and give an algorithm based on this reduction whose complexity is bounded in terms of the level of the network.</description>

      <title>When faster rotation is harmful: the competition of alliances with inner blocking mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competitors in an intransitive loop of dominance can form a defensive alliance against an external species. The vitality of this super-structure, however, is jeopardized if we modify the original rock-scissors-paper-like rule and allow that the vicinity of a predator blocks stochastically the invasion success of its neighboring prey towards a third actor. To explore the potential consequences of this multi-point interaction we introduce a minimal model where two three-member alliances are fighting but one of them suffers from this inner blocking mechanism. We demonstrate that this weakness can be compensated by a faster inner rotation which is in agreement with previous findings. This broadly valid principle, however, is not always true here because the increase of rotation speed could be harmful and results in series of reentrant phase transitions on the parameter plane. This unexpected behavior can be explained by the relation of the blocked triplet and a neutral pair formed by a triplet member with an external species. Our results provide novel aspects to the fundamental laws which determine the evolutionary process in multi-strategy ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Can a rudderless species survive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some species of salmon and sea turtle are famously good at finding their birth place to reproduce after having travelled vast expanses of ocean. In contrast, imagine now a species (maybe ancestral to the salmon or turtle) which has to find its birth place to reproduce but has no navigation skills and relies on chance alone. Would such an imaginary species survive? According to our (very simple) model it would survive if and only if the probability that a given individual find its birth place is strictly larger than 1/2.</description>

      <title>An Agnostic Biosignature Based on Modeling Panspermia and Terraformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental goal of astrobiology is to detect life outside of Earth. This proves to be an exceptional challenge outside of our solar system, where strong assumptions must be made about how life would manifest and interact with its planet. Such assumptions are required because of the lack of a consensus theory of living systems, or an understanding of the possible extent of planetary dynamics. Here we explore a model of life spreading between planetary systems via panspermia and terraformation. Our model shows that as life propagates across the galaxy, correlations emerge between planetary characteristics and location, and can function as a population-scale agnostic biosignature. This biosignature is agnostic because it is independent of strong assumptions about any particular instantiation of life or planetary characteristic--by focusing on a specific hypothesis of what life may do, rather than what life may be. By clustering planets based on their observed characteristics, and examining the spatial extent of these clusters, we demonstrate (and evaluate) a way to prioritize specific planets for further observation--based on their potential for containing life. We consider obstacles that must be overcome to practically implement our approach, including identifying specific ways in which better understanding astrophysical and planetary processes would improve our ability to detect life. Finally, we consider how this model leads us to think in novel ways about hierarchies of life and planetary scale replication.</description>

      <title>Pulsed interactions unify reaction-diffusion and spatial nonlocal models for biological pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of a spatially-organized population distribution depends on the dynamics of the population and mediators of interaction (activators and inhibitors). Two broad classes of models have been used to investigate when and how self-organization is triggered, namely, reaction-diffusion and spatially nonlocal models. Nevertheless, these models implicitly assume smooth propagation scenarios, neglecting that individuals many times interact by exchanging short and abrupt pulses of the mediating substance. A recently proposed framework advances in the direction of properly accounting for these short-scale fluctuations by applying a coarse-graining procedure on the pulse dynamics. In this paper, we generalize the coarse-graining procedure and apply the extended formalism to new scenarios in which mediators influence individuals' reproductive success or their motility. We show that, in the slow- and fast-mediator limits, pulsed interactions recover, respectively, the reaction-diffusion and nonlocal models, providing a mechanistic connection between them. Furthermore, at each limit, the spatial stability condition is qualitatively different, leading to a timescale-induced transition where spatial patterns emerge as mediator dynamics becomes sufficiently fast.</description>
