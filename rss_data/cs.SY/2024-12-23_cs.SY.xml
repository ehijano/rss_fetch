      <title>A Hybrid Three-Port Topology for Urban Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles are rapidly gaining popularity as a sustainable alternative to conventional gasoline. In urban areas, chargers with different ratings can accommodate the diverse needs of electric vehicles. However, the available multiport topologies have variable switching frequencies. This paper introduces a hybrid multiport isolated DC-DC converter for urban charging stations, incorporating fast and slow charging ports with a fixed switching frequency. It provides isolation and enables soft switching on the primary side of the converter without circulating current on its secondary side. The primary side does not need feedback, which reduces complexity. The second stage generates a wide output voltage range to charge the electric vehicle battery by employing a switch. In addition, the proposed topology offers reduced component count and simple control with fixed-frequency operation. This paper provides the concept and the operation modes. Experimental results are provided to validate its features. The prototype converter achieves 96\% peak efficiency.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Vehicle Security: A Deep Dive into Threat Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize modern transportation, offering enhanced safety, efficiency, and convenience. However, the increasing complexity and connectivity of AV systems introduce significant cybersecurity challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AV security with a focus on threat modeling frameworks, including STRIDE, DREAD, and MITRE ATT\&amp;CK, to systematically identify and mitigate potential risks. The survey examines key components of AV architectures, such as sensors, communication modules, and electronic control units (ECUs), and explores common attack vectors like wireless communication exploits, sensor spoofing, and firmware vulnerabilities. Through case studies of real-world incidents, such as the Jeep Cherokee and Tesla Model S exploits, the paper highlights the critical need for robust security measures. Emerging technologies, including blockchain for secure Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, AI-driven threat detection, and secure Over-The-Air (OTA) updates, are discussed as potential solutions to mitigate evolving threats. The paper also addresses legal and ethical considerations, emphasizing data privacy, user safety, and regulatory compliance. By combining threat modeling frameworks, multi-layered security strategies, and proactive defenses, this survey offers insights and recommendations for enhancing the cybersecurity of autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Photovoltaic Panel Quantity for Water Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a procedure for determining an approximation of the optimal amount of photovoltaics (PVs) for powering water distribution networks (WDNs) through grid-connected PVs. The procedure aims to find the PV amount minimizing the total expected cost of the WDN over the lifespan of the PVs. The approach follows an iterative process, starting with an initial estimate of the PV quantity, and then calculating the total cost of WDN operation. To calculate the total cost of the WDN, we sample PV power profiles that represent the future production based on a probabilistic PV production model. Simulations are conducted assuming these sampled PV profiles power the WDN, and pump flow rates are determined using a control method designed for PV-powered WDNs. Following the simulations, the overall WDN cost is calculated. Since we lack access to derivative information, we employ the derivative-free Nelder-Mead method for iteratively adjusting the PV quantity to find an approximation of the optimal value. The procedure is applied for the WDN of Randers, a Danish town. By determining an approximation of the optimal quantity of PVs, we observe a 14.5\% decrease in WDN costs compared to the scenario without PV installations, assuming a 25 year lifespan for the PV panels.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Control of Discontinuous Systems with Nonsmooth Safe Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the design of controllers for discontinuous dynamics that ensure the safety of non-smooth sets. The safe set is represented by arbitrarily nested unions and intersections of 0-superlevel sets of differentiable functions. We show that any optimization-based controller that satisfies only the point-wise active safety constraints is generally un-safe, ruling out the standard techniques developed for safety of continuous dynamics. This motivates the introduction of the notion of transition functions, which allow us to incorporate even the inactive safety constraints without falling into unnecessary conservatism. These functions allow system trajectories to leave a component of the nonsmooth safe set to transition to a different one. The resulting controller is then defined as the solution to a convex optimization problem, which we show is feasible and continuous wherever the system dynamics is continuous. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach in a multi-agent reconfiguration control problem.</description>

      <title>Unified Control Scheme for Optimal Allocation of GFM and GFL Inverters in Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid adoption of emerging inverter-based resources, it is crucial to understand their dynamic interactions across the network and ensure stability. This paper proposes a systematic and efficient method to determine the optimal allocation of grid-forming and grid-following inverters in power networks. The approach leverages a novel unified grid-forming/following inverter control and formulates an optimization problem to ensure stability and maximal energy dissipation during transient periods. An iterative algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. The resulting optimal droop gains for the unified inverters provide insights into the needs for grid-forming and grid-following resources in the network. A three-bus system is used to demonstrate the optimality and dynamic performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Effects of Line Dynamics on Stability Margin to Hopf Bifurcation in Grid-Forming Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the parameter sensitivity of grid-forming inverters to Hopf bifurcations to address oscillatory instability. An analytical expression for the sensitivity of the stability margin is derived based on the normal vector to the bifurcation hypersurface. We identify the most effective control parameters through comprehensive analysis. In particular, the impacts of line dynamics on the stability margin to Hopf bifurcation are investigated. The results indicate that the feedforward gain in the voltage control loop is the most effective parameter for enhancing the stability margin. Furthermore, it is observed that line dynamics introduce a uniform reduction in the stability margin across all parameters. However, the reduction is generally small for most parameters except for the voltage-reactive power droop gain, which shows a more pronounced effect.</description>

      <title>Advanced Control Strategy to Compensate Power Sharing Error and DC Circulating Current in Parallel Single-Phase Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an advanced control strategy to eliminate both current sharing error and DC circulating current caused by line impedance mismatched and measurement errors in islanded AC microgrid system. The proposed adaptive virtual impedance scheme is developed with the aid of a low bandwidth communication and a simple PI compensator to adaptively adjust the virtual impedance value so that active and reactive power will be shared equally among inverters. Meanwhile, the DC offset in output voltage measurement is detected by using the voltage ripple information of DC link voltage of inverter. The proposed control strategy can be implemented directly without any pre-knowledge of the feeder impedances. The proposed compensation scheme is simple and easy to implement, and it also does not require extra hardware circuit or sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified by simulation and experimental results of 6 kVA microgrid system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart grids enable intelligent energy management for grid managers and personalized energy services for consumers. Investigating a smart grid with IoT devices requires a simulation framework with IoT devices modeling. However, there lack comprehensive study on the modeling of IoT devices in smart grids. This paper investigates the IoT device modeling of a thermostatic load and implements the recurrent neural networks model for short-term load forecasting in this IoT-based thermostatic load. The recurrent neural network structure is leveraged to build a load forecasting model on temporal correlation. The temporal recurrent neural network layers including long short-term memory cells are employed to learn the data from both the simulation platform and New South Wales residential datasets. The simulation results are provided for demonstration.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Vector Consensus over Matrix-Weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distributed consensus of state vectors in a discrete-time multi-agent network with matrix edge weights using stochastic matrix convergence theory. We present a distributed asynchronous time update model wherein one randomly selected agent updates its state vector at a time by interacting with its neighbors. We prove that all agents converge to same state vector almost surely when every edge weight matrix is positive definite. We study vector consensus in cooperative-competitive networks with edge weights being either positive or negative definite matrices and present a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve bipartite vector consensus in such networks. We study the network structures on which agents achieve zero consensus. We also present a convergence result on nonhomogenous matrix products which is of independent interest in matrix convergence theory. All the results hold true for the synchronous time update model as well in which all agents update their states simultaneously.</description>

      <title>FTISS Adaptive Bearing-Only Formation Tracking Control with Unknown Disturbance Rejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a finite-time input-to-state stable (FTISS) bearing-only formation control law that rejects unknown constant disturbances. Unlike existing finite-time bearing-based formation control laws, which typically rely on the availability of a global coordinate frame and some information about the disturbances, our approach requires only local bearing vector measurements and does not necessitate the alignment of agent coordinate frames. The proposed control law guarantees that formation control errors converge to a neighborhood of zero in finite time, and subsequently converge to zero asymptotically. We first address the scenario where leaders are stationary and then extend the results to leaders moving with a constant velocity. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.</description>

      <title>Tutorial Problems for Nonsmooth Dynamics and Optimal Control: Ski Jumping and Accelerating a Bike Without Pedaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonsmooth phenomena, such as abrupt changes, impacts, and switching behaviors, frequently arise in real-world systems and present significant challenges for traditional optimal control methods, which typically assume smoothness and differentiability. These phenomena introduce numerical challenges in both simulation and optimization, highlighting the need for specialized solution methods. Although various applications and test problems have been documented in the literature, many are either overly simplified, excessively complex, or narrowly focused on specific domains. On this canvas, this paper proposes two novel tutorial problems that are both conceptually accessible and allow for further scaling of problem difficulty. The first problem features a simple ski jump model, characterized by state-dependent jumps and sliding motion on impact surfaces. This system does not involve control inputs and serves as a testbed for simulating nonsmooth dynamics. The second problem considers optimal control of a special type of bicycle model. This problem is inspired by practical techniques observed in BMX riding and mountain biking, where riders accelerate their bike without pedaling by strategically shifting their center of mass in response to the track's slope.</description>

      <title>PyBOP: A Python package for battery model optimisation and parameterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Python Battery Optimisation and Parameterisation (PyBOP) package provides methods for estimating and optimising battery model parameters, offering both deterministic and stochastic approaches with example workflows to assist users. PyBOP enables parameter identification from data for various battery models, including the electrochemical and equivalent circuit models provided by the popular open-source PyBaMM package. Using the same approaches, PyBOP can also be used for design optimisation under user-defined operating conditions across a variety of model structures and design goals. PyBOP facilitates optimisation with a range of methods, with diagnostics for examining optimiser performance and convergence of the cost and corresponding parameters. Identified parameters can be used for prediction, on-line estimation and control, and design optimisation, accelerating battery research and development.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the benefit of load uncertainty reduction for the design of district energy systems under grid constraints using the Value of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load uncertainty must be accounted for during design to ensure building energy systems can meet energy demands during operation. Reducing building load uncertainty allows for improved designs with less compromise to be identified, reducing the cost of decarbonizing energy usage. However, the building monitoring required to reduce load uncertainty is costly. This study quantifies the economic benefit of practical building monitoring for supporting energy system design decisions, to determine if its benefits outweigh its cost. Value of Information analysis (VoI) is a numerical framework for quantifying the benefit of uncertainty reduction to support decision making. An extension of the framework, termed 'On-Policy' VoI, is proposed, which admits complex decision making tasks where decision policies are required. This is applied to a case study district energy system design problem, where a Linear Program model is used to size solar-battery systems and grid connection capacity under uncertain building loads, modelled using historic electricity metering data. Load uncertainty is found to have a significant impact on both system operating costs (\pm30%) and the optimal system design (\pm20%). However, using building monitoring is found to reduce overall costs by less than 2% on average, less than the cost of measurement, and is therefore not economically worthwhile. This provides the first numerical evidence to support the sufficiency of using standard building load profiles for energy system design. Further, reducing only uncertainty in mean load is found to provide all available decision support benefit, meaning using hourly measurement data provides no benefit for energy retrofit design.</description>

      <title>Robust Dynamic Edge Service Placement Under Spatio-Temporal Correlated Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge computing allows Service Providers (SPs) to enhance user experience by placing their services closer to the network edge. Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</description>

      <title>Switching Frequency as FPGA Monitor: Studying Degradation and Ageing Prognosis at Large Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing deployment of unhardened embedded devices in critical systems demands the monitoring of hardware ageing as part of predictive maintenance. In this paper, we study degradation on a large deployment of 298 naturally aged FPGAs operating in the European XFEL particle accelerator. We base our statistical analyses on 280 days of in-field measurements and find a generalized and continuous degradation of the switching frequency across all devices with a median value of 0.064%. The large scale of this study allows us to localize areas of the deployed FPGAs that are highly impacted by degradation. Moreover, by training machine learning models on the collected data, we are able to forecast future trends of frequency degradation with horizons of 60 days and relative errors as little as 0.002% over an evaluation period of 100 days.</description>

Abstract: Precise identification of dynamic models in robotics is essential to support control design, friction compensation, output torque estimation, etc. A longstanding challenge remains in the identification of friction models for robotic joints, given the numerous physical phenomena affecting the underlying friction dynamics which result into nonlinear characteristics and hysteresis behaviour in particular. These phenomena proof difficult to be modelled and captured accurately using physical analogies alone. This has motivated researchers to shift from physics-based to data-driven models. Currently, these methods are still limited in their ability to generalize effectively to typical industrial robot deployement, characterized by high- and low-velocity operations and frequent direction reversals. Empirical observations motivate the use of dynamic friction models but these remain particulary challenging to establish. To address the current limitations, we propose to account for unidentified dynamics in the robot joints using latent dynamic states. The friction model may then utilize both the dynamic robot state and additional information encoded in the latent state to evaluate the friction torque. We cast this stochastic and partially unsupervised identification problem as a standard probabilistic representation learning problem. In this work both the friction model and latent state dynamics are parametrized as neural networks and integrated in the conventional lumped parameter dynamic robot model. The complete dynamics model is directly learned from the noisy encoder measurements in the robot joints. We use the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm to find a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the model parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in terms of open-loop prediction accuracy in comparison with baseline methods, using the Kuka KR6 R700 as a test platform.</description>

      <title>Engineering high-Q superconducting tantalum microwave coplanar waveguide resonators for compact coherent quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has recently received considerable attention in manufacturing robust superconducting quantum circuits. Ta offers low microwave loss, high kinetic inductance compared to aluminium (Al) and niobium (Nb), and good compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which is essential for quantum computing applications. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication engineering of thickness-dependent high quality factor (high-Q_i) Ta superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators. All films are deposited on high-resistivity silicon substrates at room temperature without additional substrate heating. Before Ta deposition, a niobium (Nb) seed layer is used to ensure a body-centred cubic lattice ({\alpha}-Ta) formation. We further engineer the kinetic inductance (L_K) resonators by varying Ta film thicknesses. High L_K is a key advantage for applications because it facilitates the realisation of high-impedance, compact quantum circuits with enhanced coupling to qubits. The maximum internal quality factor Q_i of ~ 3.6 * 10^6 is achieved at the high power regime for 100 nm Ta, while the highest kinetic inductance is obtained to be 0.6 pH/sq for the thinnest film, which is 40 nm. This combination of high Q_i and high L_K highlights the potential of Ta microwave circuits for high-fidelity operations of compact quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bilevel Difference Convex Programming for Bayesian Risk Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon Markov Decision Processes where parameters, such as transition probabilities, are unknown and estimated from data. The popular distributionally robust approach to addressing the parameter uncertainty can sometimes be overly conservative. In this paper, we utilize the recently proposed formulation, Bayesian risk Markov Decision Process (BR-MDP), to address parameter (or epistemic) uncertainty in MDPs. To solve the infinite-horizon BR-MDP with a class of convex risk measures, we propose a computationally efficient approach called approximate bilevel difference convex programming (ABDCP). The optimization is performed offline and produces the optimal policy that is represented as a finite state controller with desirable performance guarantees. We also demonstrate the empirical performance of the BR-MDP formulation and the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Quadrotors that can operate predictably in the presence of imperfect model knowledge and external disturbances are crucial in safety-critical applications. We present L1Quad, a control architecture that ensures uniformly bounded transient response of the quadrotor's uncertain dynamics on the special Euclidean group SE(3). By leveraging the geometric controller and the L1 adaptive controller, the L1Quad architecture provides a theoretically justified framework for the design and analysis of quadrotor's tracking controller in the presence of nonlinear (time- and state-dependent) uncertainties on both the translational and rotational dynamics. In addition, we validate the performance of the L1Quad architecture through extensive experiments for eleven types of uncertainties across various trajectories. The results demonstrate that the L1Quad can achieve consistently small tracking errors despite the uncertainties and disturbances and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art controllers.</description>

      <title>Coordinating O&amp;M and Logistical Resources to Enhance Post-Disaster Resilience of Interdependent Power and Natural Gas Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16473v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric power and natural gas systems are becoming increasingly interdependent, driven by the growth of natural gas-fired generation and the electrification of the gas industry. Recent energy crises have underscored the urgent need for enhanced resilience in these interdependent systems. In response to this challenge, this paper focuses on the interdependent electric power and natural gas distribution systems and proposes a comprehensive strategy for enhancing their resilience, which involves optimally coordinating various resources encompassing emergency operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) and logistical support, to efficiently restore damaged services and infrastructure. Specifically, generators, including those with fuel switching capability, are dispatched to provide emergency power, with the logistical process of fuel supply being particularly managed by coordinated scheduling of mobile fuel tankers. Additionally, integrated demand responses for power and gas are dispatched to alleviate operational stresses using a zonewise approach that groups customers with intertwined energy supplies into individual, dispatchable units. Furthermore, the strategy incorporates the repair of damaged facilities, with particular consideration given to the varying repair efficiencies dependent on the dispatched repair units, aiming to closely simulate actual repair scenarios. The strategy is encapsulated in a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model, with case studies conducted to validate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Dual-Port Grid-Forming Interconnecting Power Converters in Hybrid AC/DC Grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interconnecting power converters (IPC) are the main elements enabling the interconnection of multiple high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) subgrids. These converters can be classified either as grid-forming or grid-following. These roles can be assigned to both ac and dc terminals. This work compares state-of-the-art single-port grid-forming and grid-following control schemes with a dual-port grid-forming control scheme, which can simultaneously form a stable voltage on the ac and the dc sides. The dual-port grid-forming small-signal stability and dynamic behavior under fluctuations in the power flow are studied and compared against state-of-the-art control architectures. Moreover, the dual-port control scheme is validated and tested on a down-scaled laboratory platform with several transient events.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Probabilistic Battery Health Management Approach for Robust Inspection Drone Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Health monitoring of remote critical infrastructure is a complex and expensive activity due to the limited infrastructure accessibility. Inspection drones are ubiquitous assets that enhance the reliability of critical infrastructures through improved accessibility. However, due to the harsh operation environment, it is crucial to monitor their health to ensure successful inspection operations. The battery is a key component that determines the overall reliability of the inspection drones and, with an appropriate health management approach, contributes to reliable and robust inspections. In this context, this paper presents a novel hybrid probabilistic approach for battery end-of-discharge (EOD) voltage prediction of Li-Po batteries. The hybridization is achieved in an error-correction configuration, which combines physics-based discharge and probabilistic error-correction models to quantify the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The performance of the hybrid probabilistic methodology was empirically evaluated on a dataset comprising EOD voltage under varying load conditions. The dataset was obtained from real inspection drones operated on different flights, focused on offshore wind turbine inspections. The proposed approach has been tested with different probabilistic methods and demonstrates 14.8% improved performance in probabilistic accuracy compared to the best probabilistic method. In addition, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties provide robust estimations to enhance the diagnosis of battery health-states.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Relaxation based Non-Conservative Chance Constrained Stochastic MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chance constrained stochastic model predictive controllers (CC-SMPC) trade off full constraint satisfaction for economical plant performance under uncertainty. Previous CC-SMPC works are over-conservative in constraint violations leading to worse economic performance. Other past works require a-priori information about the uncertainty set, limiting their application. This paper considers a discrete LTI system with hard constraints on inputs and chance constraints on states, with unknown uncertainty distribution, statistics, or samples. This work proposes a novel adaptive online update rule to relax the state constraints based on the time-average of past constraint violations, to achieve reduced conservativeness in closed-loop. Under an ideal control policy assumption, it is proven that the time-average of constraint violations asymptotically converges to the maximum allowed violation probability. The method is applied for optimal battery energy storage system (BESS) dispatch in a grid connected microgrid with PV generation and load demand, with chance constraints on BESS state-of-charge (SOC). Realistic simulations show the superior electricity cost saving potential of the proposed method as compared to the traditional economic MPC without chance constraints, and a state-of-the-art approach with chance constraints. We satisfy the chance constraints non-conservatively in closed-loop, effectively trading off increased cost savings with minimal adverse effects on BESS lifetime.</description>

      <title>Aggregative games with bilevel structures: Distributed algorithms and convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of distributively searching the Stackelberg equilibria of aggregative games with bilevel structures is studied. Different from the traditional aggregative games, here the aggregation is determined by the minimizer of the objective function in the inner level, which depends on players' actions in the outer level. Moreover, the global objective function in the inner level is formed by the sum of some local bifunctions, each of which is strongly convex with respect to the second argument and is only available to a specific player. To handle this problem, first, we propose a second order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where the Hessain matrices associated with the objective functions in the inner level is involved. By the algorithm, players update their actions in the outer level while cooperatively minimizing the sum of the bifunctions in the inner level to estimate the aggregation by communicating with their neighbors via a connected graph. Under mild assumptions on the graph and cost functions, we prove that the actions of players and the estimate on the aggregation asymptotically converge to the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, for the case where the Hessain matrices associated with the objective functions in the inner level are not available, we propose a first order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where a distributed two-point estimate strategy is developed to estimate the gradients of cost functions in the outer level. Under the same conditions, we prove that the convergence errors of players' actions and the estimate on the aggregation to the Stackelberg equilibrium are linear with respect to the estimate parameters. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: Quantum noise plays a pivotal role in understanding quantum transport phenomena, including current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this domain is $\Delta_T$ noise, which arises due to a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. This paper investigates $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions with insulators, where the average charge current is zero at zero voltage bias, through the measurement of quantum shot noise, i.e., $\Delta_T$ noise. Notably, we find that the $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor junctions is significantly larger than in metal-insulator-metal junctions. Furthermore, our results reveal that $\Delta_T$ noise initially increases with barrier strength, peaks, and then decreases, while it shows a steady increase with temperature bias, highlighting the nuanced interplay between barrier characteristics and thermal gradients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural network embedding is a crucial step in enabling effective downstream tasks for complex systems that aims to project a network into a lower-dimensional space while preserving similarities among nodes. We introduce a simple and efficient embedding technique based on approximate variants of equitable partitions. The approximation consists in introducing a user-tunable tolerance parameter relaxing the otherwise strict condition for exact equitable partitions that can be hardly found in real-world networks. We exploit a relationship between equitable partitions and equivalence relations for Markov chains and ordinary differential equations to develop a partition refinement algorithm for computing an approximate equitable partition in polynomial time. We compare our method against state-of-the-art embedding techniques on benchmark networks. We report comparable -- when not superior -- performance for visualization, classification, and regression tasks at a cost between one and three orders of magnitude smaller using a prototype implementation, enabling the embedding of large-scale networks which could not be efficiently handled by most of the competing techniques.</description>

      <title>Employing observability rank conditions for taking into account experimental information a priori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of identifiability describes the possibility of inferring the parameters of a dynamic model by observing its output. It is common and useful to distinguish between structural and practical identifiability. The former property is fully determined by the model equations, while the latter is also influenced by the characteristics of the available experimental data. Structural identifiability can be determined by means of symbolic computations, which may be performed before collecting experimental data, and are hence sometimes called a priori analyses. Practical identifiability is typically assessed numerically, with methods that require simulations - and often also optimization - and are applied a posteriori. An approach to study structural local identifiability is to consider it as a particular case of observability, which is the possibility of inferring the internal state of a system from its output. Thus, both properties can be analysed jointly, by building a generalized observability matrix and computing its rank. The aim of this paper is to investigate to which extent such observability-based methods can also inform about practical aspects related with the experimental setup, which are usually not approached in this way. To this end, we explore a number of possible extensions of the rank tests, and discuss the purposes for which they can be informative as well as others for which they cannot.</description>

      <title>Data Publishing in Mechanics and Dynamics: Challenges, Guidelines, and Examples from Engineering Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-based methods have gained increasing importance in engineering, especially but not only driven by successes with deep artificial neural networks. Success stories are prevalent, e.g., in areas such as data-driven modeling, control and automation, as well as surrogate modeling for accelerated simulation. Beyond engineering, generative and large-language models are increasingly helping with tasks that, previously, were solely associated with creative human processes. Thus, it seems timely to seek artificial-intelligence-support for engineering design tasks to automate, help with, or accelerate purpose-built designs of engineering systems, e.g., in mechanics and dynamics, where design so far requires a lot of specialized knowledge. However, research-wise, compared to established, predominantly first-principles-based methods, the datasets used for training, validation, and test become an almost inherent part of the overall methodology. Thus, data publishing becomes just as important in (data-driven) engineering science as appropriate descriptions of conventional methodology in publications in the past. This article analyzes the value and challenges of data publishing in mechanics and dynamics, in particular regarding engineering design tasks, showing that the latter raise also challenges and considerations not typical in fields where data-driven methods have been booming originally. Possible ways to deal with these challenges are discussed and a set of examples from across different design problems shows how data publishing can be put into practice. The analysis, discussions, and examples are based on the research experience made in a priority program of the German research foundation focusing on research on artificially intelligent design assistants in mechanics and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Newton Dynamics for Neural Networks: A Riemannian Optimization Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping factor yields robustness to ill-conditioned kernels, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.</description>
