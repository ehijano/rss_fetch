      <title>An Interactive Metrics Dashboard for the Keck Observatory Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2004, the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) has operated as a NASA-funded collaboration between the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute ( NExScI) and the W.M. Keck Observatory. It ingests and serves all data acquired by the twin 10-meter Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. In the past three years, KOA has begun a modernization program to replace the architecture and systems used since the archive's creation with a new modern Python-based infrastructure. This infrastructure will position KOA to respond to the rapid growth of new and complex data sets that will be acquired by new instruments now in development, and enable follow-up to identify the deluge of alerts of transient sources expected by new survey telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Since 2022, KOA has ingested new data in near-real time, generally within one minute of creation, and has made them immediately accessible to observers through a dedicated web interface. The archive is now deploying a new, scalable, Python-based, VO-compliant query infrastructure built with the Plotly-Dash framework and R-tree indices to speed-up queries by a factor of 20.
  The project described here exploits the new query infrastructure to develop a dashboard that will return live metrics on the performance and growth of the archive. These metrics assess the current health of the archive and guide planning future hardware and software upgrades. This single dashboard will enable, for example, monitoring of real-time ingestion, as well as studying the long-term growth of the archive. Current methods of gathering metrics that have been in place since the archive opened will not support the archive as it continues to scale. These methods suffer from high latency, are not optimized for on-demand metrics, are scattered among various tools, and are cumbersome to use.</description>

      <title>Spectral response of SPHEREx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spectro Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) is conducting the first all-sky near infrared spectral survey spanning 0.75 to 5.0um with resolving power R~35 to 130. Linear variable filters mounted in front of six H2RG detectors produce a position dependent spectral response across the focal plane.
  This paper presents the ground-based spectral calibration of SPHEREx, including the cryogenic apparatus, optical configuration, measurement strategy, analysis pipeline, and resulting calibration products. Monochromatic wavelength scans are used to derive the spectral response function, band center, and resolving power for every pixel. Band centers are measured to better than 1nm for Bands 1 through 4 (0.75 to 3.82um) and better than 10nm for Bands 5 and 6 (3.82 to 5.0um). Out-of-band leakage is negligible for detectors above 1.64um and is present at the percent level below this wavelength. The resolving power is measured to within 5% and agrees with design expectations to within 10%.
  An on-sky spectrum of the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) constructed from repeated observations provides in-flight verification and shows agreement between ground calibrated response and astrophysical emission features. Calibration products, including per-pixel band center and resolving power maps, are released through IPAC to support community use of SPHEREx data. The absolute spectral calibration will continue to improve through in-flight measurements, with further reductions in uncertainty expected for the longest-wavelength bands.</description>

      <title>NIAC project report: Solar system-scale VLBI to dramatically improve cosmological distance measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility and scientific potential of the Cosmic Positioning System (CPS), a space mission concept enabling purely geometric distance measurements to sources at hundreds of megaparsecs by directly detecting electromagnetic wavefront curvature. CPS consists of a constellation of radio antennas distributed across the outer Solar System, operating on baselines of tens of astronomical units. By precisely timing the arrival of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), CPS infers source distances via trilateration -- analogous to global navigation satellite systems such as GPS but on cosmological scales.
  We show that CPS distance measurements could result in sub-percent constraints on the Hubble constant with even a handful of detections, whereas we predict that 10-100 FRB sources are likely visible. We evaluate dominant sources of uncertainty -- wavefront timing precision, interstellar refractive delays, spacecraft positional knowledge, and onboard clock stability -- finding these controllable at required levels using near-term technologies. Our nominal design employs five spacecraft with 8 m deployable antennas, 3-6 GHz receivers with sub-30 K system temperatures, and space-qualified atomic clocks similar to those on GPS satellites, supported by a ground network for ranging calibration and FRB alerts.
  Beyond cosmic expansion, CPS may enable frontier measurements in astrophysics and fundamental physics, including constraints on small-scale dark matter structure, microhertz gravitational waves (bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA), and the outer Solar System mass distribution. The most significant viability issue concerns FRB properties at several-GHz frequencies; we recommend observational campaigns to characterize repeating FRBs in this band.</description>

      <title>astromorph: Self-supervised machine learning pipeline for astronomical morphology analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern telescopes generate increasingly large and diverse datasets, often consisting of complex and morphologically rich structures. To efficiently explore such data requires automated methods that can extract and organize physically meaningful information, ideally without the need for extensive manual interaction. We aim to provide a user-friendly implementation of a self-supervised machine learning framework to explore morphological properties of large datasets, based on the BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latents) method. By enabling the generation of meaningful image embeddings without manually labelled data, the framework will enable key tasks such as clustering, anomaly detection, and similarity based exploration. In contrast to existing BYOL implementations, astromorph accommodates data of varying dimensions and resolutions, including both single-channel FITS images and multi-channel spectral cubes. The package is built with usability in mind, offering streamlined pipeline scripts for ease of use as well as deeper customization options via PyTorch-based classes. To demonstrate the utility of astromorph, we apply it in two contrasting science cases representing different astronomical domains: images of protoplanetary disks observed with ALMA, and infrared dark clouds observed with Spitzer and Herschel. In both cases, we demonstrate how astromorph produces scientifically meaningful embeddings that capture morphological differences and similarities across large samples. astromorph enables users to apply a robust, label-free approach for uncovering morphological patterns in astronomical datasets. The successful application to two markedly different datasets suggest that the pipeline is broadly applicable across a wide range of imaging-rich astronomical context, providing a user friendly tool for advancing discovery in observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>A new strategy for achieving multiple continuous cooling stages in an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a three-stage continuous adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (CADR) simultaneously providing cooling platforms at two different temperatures. Unlike conventional CADR with two continuous stages, this system does not require an extra continuous stage. It is achieved with carefully designed heat switch operations and stage sequences. This new strategy significantly reduces system complexity and mass. The detailed implementation of the two cooling platforms is described, and factors limiting system performance are analyzed. This CADR system has achieved a cooling power of 20 {\mu}W@1 K and 4 {\mu}W@300 mK simultaneously, offering a new design strategy for the development of CADR with multiple continuous stages.</description>

      <title>Talking with the Latents -- how to convert your LLM into an astronomer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unique opportunities for scientific tasks, yet their ability to reason over complex numerical data remains largely unexplored. We propose a simple mechanism to introduce domain-specific physical knowledge into LLMs by fusing pre-trained latent physical features with a pre-trained language model. Our method employs a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework where a large LLM (teacher) generates synthetic question-answer supervision to transfer physical reasoning to a smaller LLM (student). The student is conditioned on latent physical features and trained via a lightweight adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We demonstrate that this approach, applied to models with 1B, 8B, and 32B parameters, enables effective reasoning over real scientific data. Our models substantially outperform strong baselines, such as Gemini 3 Pro, across multiple downstream tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. We show that the model combines latent information with general physical understanding to predict complex properties and can be "steered" by identifying physically meaningful directions in the latent space. This allows for explicit physical manipulation and natural language interpretation of latent structures. While our experiments focus on astrophysics, the framework is domain-agnostic and applicable to various scientific fields. Our main contribution is a general framework for using LLMs as interpretable interfaces to scientific latent spaces, enabling a single model to perform diverse tasks through natural language guidance. This work marks a step toward developing scientifically capable and useful LLMs.</description>

      <title>The Pollux European instrument concept for HWO: a high-resolution spectrograph and spectropolarimeter from the far-UV to the near-IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pollux is a high-resolution spectrograph and spectropolarimeter working from 100 nm to 1.8 microns proposed for HWO by a European consortium. Pollux will allow us to study stellar and (exo)planetary systems, as well as cosmic ecosystems. For example, Pollux will provide new insights on exoplanet formation and evolution, characterization of the atmospheres and magnetospheres of stars and planets, and star-planet interactions. It will also allow us to resolve narrow UV emission and absorption lines, enabling us to follow the baryon cycle over cosmic time -- from galaxies forming stars out of interstellar gas and grains, and planets forming in circumstellar disks, to the various forms of feedback into the interstellar and intergalactic medium -- and from active galactic nuclei. The most innovative characteristic of Pollux is its unique spectropolarimetric capability in the UV, which will open a new parameter space. Its very high spectral resolution (~70000 to ~100000) and stability over a very large wavelength range will also be a major asset. In this paper, we summarize the main scientific drivers of Pollux and present its current design, technological challenges, and the Pollux consortium organization.</description>

      <title>Reference File Updates Following the Application of New Geometric Distortion and Walk Corrections I: Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calibration of Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) data is performed by the data processing pipeline known as CalCOS. CalCOS utilizes several reference files that store information required for data processing (e.g., dispersion solutions), and these reference files can be updated for the purpose of improving calibrated data products. In 2024 a major effort to improve the far-ultraviolet (FUV) geometric distortion, delta-geometric, and walk corrections was completed. Those three corrections occur early in the CalCOS workflow and shift photon events into the corrected reference frame ((XCORR, YCORR) coordinate system) in which subsequent calibration steps-and their reference files-are defined. This change necessitated the re-derivation of all "downstream" reference files in use at the time. Here we summarize the effort to create new versions of 56 reference files applicable to lifetime positions 1 through 6 and intended for use with the new geometric distortion, delta geometric, and walk corrections. The primary outcome of this work is improved wavelength and flux calibrations for COS FUV spectra.</description>

      <title>Operational Mass Measurement for Flyby Reconnaissance Missions of Potentially Hazardous Asteroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates a technique for determining the mass of a potentially hazardous asteroid from a high-speed flyby in the context of a rapid reconnaissance planetary defense scenario. We consider a host spacecraft that dispenses a small CubeSat, which acts as a test-mass. Both spacecraft perform approach maneuvers to target their flyby locations, with the host targeting a close proximity flyby and the CubeSat targeting a distant flyby. By incorporating short-range intersatellite measurements between the host and the CubeSat, the mass measurement sensitivity is substantially improved. We evaluate a set of proposed host and CubeSat hardware options against the 2023 and 2025 Planetary Defense Conference hypothetical threats, as well as a hypothetical flyby of 2024 YR4. These scenarios differ predominantly in their flyby speeds, which span from 1.7 to 22 km/s. Based on these scenarios, we demonstrate that a typical radio-frequency intersatellite measurement is ineffective for asteroids with diameters relevant to planetary defense (i.e., 50 - 500 m). However, we find that augmenting the system with a laser-based intersatellite ranging system or a high-precision Doppler system can enable mass measurements of asteroids as small as 100 m across all cases, and as small as 50 m for the slower (&lt; 8 km/s) cases. The results are very sensitive to the timing of the final maneuver, which is used to target the low-altitude flyby point. This presents an operational challenge for the smallest objects, where optical detection times are comparatively late and the optical navigation targeting knowledge converges too slowly.</description>

      <title>A Narrowband Technosignature Search Toward the Hycean Candidate K2-18b Using the VLA and MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K2-18b, a sub-Neptune exoplanet located in the habitable zone of its host star, has emerged as an important target for atmospheric characterization and assessments of potential habitability. Motivated by recent interpretations of JWST observations suggesting a hydrogen-rich atmosphere consistent with Hycean-world scenarios, we conducted a coordinated, multi-epoch search for narrowband radio technosignatures using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array equipped with the COSMIC backend and the MeerKAT telescope with the BLUSE backend. Our observations span frequencies from 544MHz to 9.8GHz and include multiple epochs that cover at least one full orbital period of the planet. In this work, we outline, create, and apply a comprehensive post-processing framework that incorporates observatory-informed RFI masking, drift-rate filtering based on the expected dynamics of the K2-18 system, multibeam spatial discrimination, primary and secondary transit filtering (when applicable), and SNR-based excision of weak and strong spurious signals. Across all bands and epochs, no signals consistent with an astrophysical or artificial origin were identified at a limit of 10^12 to 10^13W. These non-detections allow us to place upper limits on the presence of persistent, isotropic narrowband transmitters within the K2-18 system, providing the first interferometric technosignature constraints for a Hycean-planet candidate. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of coordinated multiepoch interferometric searches and establish a methodological framework for future technosignature studies of nearby potentially habitable exoplanets.</description>

      <title>A comparison of G-band brightness as a proxy-magnetometer in various magnetic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the diagnostic potential of the G-band at 430.4 nm for probing small-scale magnetic fields in the solar photosphere. Combining three-dimensional MHD simulations from the MURaM code and spectral synthesis via the RH 1.5D code, we evaluate the intensity contrast in the G-band filtergrams by comparing the filter centered at 430.4 nm in comparison to the conventional 430.5 nm. Our results show that filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm provide higher contrast across varying magnetic environments, particularly at narrow filter widths. This enhancement arises from its slightly higher formation height and greater sensitivity to temperature variations in magnetized regions. These findings indicate that G-band filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm show enhanced diagnostic potential under the assumptions of the present modeling. The obtained results are also relevant and suggest potential applications in stellar contexts, where molecular bands are often used as proxies for magnetic activity.</description>

      <title>Space AI: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Space to Improve Life on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming domains from healthcare and agriculture to finance and industry. As progress on Earth meets growing constraints, the next frontier is outer space, where AI can enable autonomous, resilient operations under extreme uncertainty and limited human oversight. This paper introduces Space AI as a unified interdisciplinary field at the intersection of artificial intelligence and space science and technology. We consolidate historical developments and contemporary progress, and propose a systematic framework that organises Space AI into four mission contexts: 1 AI on Earth, covering intelligent mission planning, spacecraft design optimisation, simulation, and ground-based data analytics; 2 AI in Orbit, focusing on satellite and station autonomy, space robotics, on-board/near-real-time data processing, communication optimisation, and orbital safety; 3 AI in Deep Space, enabling autonomous navigation, adaptive scientific discovery, resource mapping, and long-duration human-AI collaboration under communication constraints; and 4 AI for Multi-Planetary Life, supporting in-situ resource utilisation, habitat and infrastructure construction, life-support and ecological management, and resilient interplanetary networks. Ultimately, Space AI can accelerate humanity's capability to explore and operate in space, while translating advances in sensing, robotics, optimisation, and trustworthy AI into broad societal impact on Earth.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Cell-based Coadds and Metadetection Weak Lensing Shape Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Metadetection weak lensing galaxy shape catalogue from the six-year Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) imaging data. This dataset is the final release from DES, spanning 4422 deg$^2$ of the southern sky. We describe how the catalogue was constructed, including the two new major processing steps, cell-based image coaddition and shear measurements with Metadetection. The DES Y6 Metadetection weak lensing shape catalogue consists of 151,922,791 galaxies detected over riz bands, with an effective number density of $n_{\rm eff}$ =8.22 galaxies per arcmin$^2$ and shape noise of $\sigma_e$ = 0.29. We carry out a suite of validation tests on the catalogue, including testing for PSF leakage, testing for the impact of PSF modeling errors, and testing the correlation of the shear measurements with galaxy, PSF, and survey properties. In addition to demonstrating that our catalogue is robust for weak lensing science, we use the DES Y6 image simulation suite (Mau, Becker et al. 2025) to estimate the overall multiplicative shear bias of our shear measurement pipeline. We find no detectable multiplicative bias at the roughly half-percent level, with m = (3.4 $\pm$ 6.1) x $10^{-3}$, at 3$\sigma$ uncertainty. This is the first time both cell-based coaddition and Metadetection algorithms are applied to observational data, paving the way to the Stage-IV weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Substructures with Free-Form Modelling: A Case Study of the `Jackpot' Strong Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterising the population and internal structure of sub-galactic halos is critical for constraining the nature of dark matter. These halos can be detected near galaxies that act as strong gravitational lenses with extended arcs, as they perturb the shapes of the arcs. However, this method is subject to false-positive detections and systematic uncertainties, particularly degeneracies between an individual halo and larger-scale asymmetries in the distribution of lens mass. We present a new free-form lens modelling code, developed within the framework of the open-source software \texttt{PyAutoLens}, to address these challenges. Our method models mass perturbations that cannot be captured by parametric models as pixelized potential corrections and suppresses unphysical solutions via a Mat\'ern regularisation scheme that is inspired by Gaussian process regression. This approach enables the recovery of diverse mass perturbations, including subhalos, line-of-sight halos, external shear, and multipole components that represent the complex angular mass distribution of the lens galaxy, such as boxiness/diskiness. Additionally, our fully Bayesian framework objectively infers hyperparameters associated with the regularisation of pixelized sources and potential corrections, eliminating the need for manual fine-tuning. By applying our code to the well-known `Jackpot' lens system, SLACS0946+1006, we robustly detect a highly concentrated subhalo that challenges the standard cold dark matter model. This study represents the first attempt to independently reveal the mass distribution of a subhalo using a fully free-form approach.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Release of A databaSe of millimeTeR ObservatioNs of Asteroids Using acT (ASTRONAUT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present A databaSe of millimeTeR ObservatioNs of Asteroids Using acT (ASTRONAUT) hosted on Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) in the form of a public Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. This bucket is an Amazon cloud storage database containing flux measurements for a group of asteroids at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. These measurements were collected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021 in frequency bands centered near 90, 150, and 220 GHz. The ASTRONAUT database contains observation times, normalized flux values, and associated error bars for 170 asteroids above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 for a single frequency band over the stacked co-added maps. We provide an example in generating light curves with this database. We also present a Jupyter notebook to serve as a reference guide when using the S3 bucket. The container and notebook are publicly available in a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of the Absolute Sky Brightness at 60 to 350 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a precision measurement of radio sky brightness over 60-350 MHz. Accurate knowledge of the radio sky over these frequencies is essential for modelling foregrounds in experiments targeting cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization. Measurements below 1 GHz are also needed to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, constrain nanojansky radio source populations and dark matter models, understand origins of the diffuse radio background, and improve calibration of long-wavelength radio telescopes. Here we show that current all-sky maps and the 2016 Global Sky Model (GSM2016) require substantial corrections over 60-350 MHz. GSM2016 has an offset exceeding 100 K below 100 MHz and must be scaled up by a factor increasing from 1.2 below 200 MHz to 1.5 at 350 MHz. This significantly increases previously inferred excess radio background, motivating review of faint source populations and dark-matter decay models. Our measurement used a new receiver architecture that self-calibrates its noise contribution and bandpass in situ while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, log-periodic SKALA4.1 antenna on a 40 m diameter SKA-Low station ground mesh. Sky models scaled to our measurements can set the absolute flux-density scale for SKA-Low and other low-frequency radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>YOLO-CIANNA: Galaxy detection with deep learning in radio data: II. Winning the SKA SDC2 using a generalized 3D-YOLO network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the scientific exploitation of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) approaches, there is a need for new advanced data analysis and visualization tools capable of processing large high-dimensional datasets. In this study, we aim to generalize the YOLO-CIANNA deep learning source detection and characterization method for 3D hyperspectral HI emission cubes. We present the adaptations we made to the regression-based detection formalism and the construction of an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. We then describe a processing pipeline for applying the method to simulated 3D HI cubes from the SKA Observatory Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset. The YOLO-CIANNA method was originally developed and used by the MINERVA team that won the official SDC2 competition. Despite the public release of the full SDC2 dataset, no published result has yet surpassed MINERVA's top score. In this paper, we present an updated version of our method that improves our challenge score by 9.5%. The resulting catalog exhibits a high detection purity of 92.3%, best-in-class characterization accuracy, and contains 45% more confirmed sources than concurrent classical detection tools. The method is also computationally efficient, processing the full ~1TB SDC2 data cube in 30 min on a single GPU. These state-of-the-art results highlight the effectiveness of 3D CNN-based detectors for processing large hyperspectral data cubes and represent a promising step toward applying YOLO-CIANNA to observational data from SKA and its precursors.</description>

      <title>ExoIris: fast exoplanet transmission spectroscopy in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present ExoIris, a user-friendly Python package for exoplanet transmission and emission spectroscopy. Unlike existing tools, ExoIris models two-dimensional spectrophotometric transit time series directly and supports the joint analysis of multiple datasets obtained with different instruments and at different epochs, as well as modeling stellar spot crossings and the influence of unocculted heterogeneities (the transit light source effect). These features enable a self-consistent estimation of both wavelength-independent and wavelength-dependent parameters. They offer a more robust workflow than the commonly used two-step approach, in which a "white" light curve is fitted first, and the transmission spectrum is then derived from independent fits constrained by the white-light solution. Despite its increased flexibility and robustness, ExoIris remains computationally efficient. A low-resolution transmission spectrum can be estimated from a single JWST NIRISS transit observation in ~5 minutes assuming white noise, and in ~15 minutes when accounting for time-correlated systematics using a Gaussian process noise model, on a standard desktop computer.</description>

      <title>NovaMoon: A Strategic Lunar Reference Station for Positioning, Timing, and Largely Enhanced Science in the Earth-Moon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links -- making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity.</description>
