      <title>A fluctuation-sensitivity-timescale trade-off in feedback-controlled dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback control is a renowned mechanism for attenuating intrinsic fluctuation in regulatory networks. However, its impact on the response sensitivity to external signals and the response timescale, which are also critical for signal transmission, has yet to be understood. In this letter, we study a general feedback-controlled network in which the feedback is achieved by a complex interactive module. By comparing the solution of Langevin equations with and without feedback, we analytically derive a fundamental trade-off between fluctuation, sensitivity, and timescale altered by the feedback. We show that feedback control cannot infinitely suppress fluctuation without the cost of reducing sensitivity or response speed. Furthermore, the lower bound for this trade-off can be reduced up to half in non-gradient dynamical systems compared to gradient systems. We validate this trade-off as a tight bound for high-dimensional systems in nonlinear regime through numerical simulations. These results elucidate the fundamental limitation of feedback control in enhancing the information transmission capacity of regulatory networks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the complex interplay of anisotropies in magnetosomes of magnetotactic bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are of significant interest for biophysical applications, particularly in cancer treatment. The biomineralized magnetosomes produced by these bacteria are high-quality magnetic nanoparticles that form chains through a highly reproducible natural process. Specifically, Magnetovibrio blakemorei and Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense exhibit distinct magnetosome morphologies: truncated hexa-octahedral and truncated octahedral shapes, respectively. Despite having identical compositions (magnetite, Fe3O4) and comparable dimensions, their effective uniaxial anisotropies differ significantly, with M. blakemorei showing ~25 kJ/m^3 and M. gryphiswaldense ~11 kJ/m^3 at 300K. This variation presents a unique opportunity to explore the role of different anisotropy contributions in the magnetic responses of magnetite-based nanoparticles. This study systematically investigates these responses by examining static magnetization as a function of temperature (M vs. T, 5 mT) and magnetic field (M vs. H, up to 1 T). Above the Verwey transition temperature (110 K), the effective anisotropy is dominated by shape anisotropy, notably increasing coercivity for M. blakemorei by up to two-fold compared to M. gryphiswaldense. Below this temperature, the effective uniaxial anisotropy increases non-monotonically, significantly altering magnetic behavior. Our simulations based on dynamic Stoner-Wohlfarth models indicate that below the Verwey temperature, a uniaxial magnetocrystalline contribution emerges, peaking at ~22-24 kJ/m^3 at 5 K, values close to those of bulk magnetite. This demonstrates the profound impact of anisotropic properties on the magnetic behaviors and applications of magnetite-based nanoparticles and highlights the exceptional utility of magnetosomes as ideal model systems for studying the complex interplay of anisotropies in magnetite-based nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Growth of Stress-Responsive Bacteria in 3D Colonies under Confining Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study three-dimensional colonies of nonmotile stress-responsive bacteria growing under confining isotropic pressure in a nutrient-rich environment. We develop a novel simulation method to demonstrate how imposing an external pressure leads to a denser aggregate and strengthens the mechanical interactions between bacteria. Unlike rigid confinements that prevent bacterial growth, confining pressure acts as a soft constraint and allows colony expansion with a nearly linear long-term population growth and colony size. Enhancing the mechanosensitivity reduces instantaneous bacterial growth rates and the overall colony size, though its impact is modest compared to pressure for our studied set of biologically relevant parameter values. The doubling time grows exponentially at low mechanosensitivity or pressure in our bacterial growth model. We provide an analytical estimate of the doubling time and develop a population dynamics model consistent with our simulations. Our findings align with previous experimental results for E. coli colonies under pressure. Understanding the growth dynamics of stress-responsive bacteria under mechanical stresses provides insight into their adaptive response to varying environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry, a possible avenue for thermal ablation in oncology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a model for hyperthermia therapies based on heat diffusion in a biological tissue containing a topological defect. Biological tissues behave like active liquid crystals with the presence of topological defects which are likely to anchor tumors during the metastatic phase of cancer evolution and the therapy challenge is to destroy the cancer cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissues. The defect creates an effective non-Euclidean geometry for low-energy excitations, modifying the bio-heat equation. Applications to protocols of thermal ablation for various biological tissues (liver, prostate, and skin) is analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Self-replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a theoretical model for a self-replicating mechanical system inspired by biological processes within living cells and supported by computer simulations. The model decomposes self-replication into core components, each of which is executed by a single machine constructed from a set of basic block types. Key functionalities such as sorting, copying, and building, are demonstrated. The model provides valuable insights into the constraints of self-replicating systems. The discussion also addresses the spatial and timing behavior of the system, as well as its efficiency and complexity. This work provides a foundational framework for future studies on self-replicating mechanisms and their information-processing applications.</description>

      <title>Identifying Influential and Vulnerable Nodes in Interaction Networks through Estimation of Transfer Entropy Between Univariate and Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer entropy (TE) is a powerful tool for measuring causal relationships within interaction networks. Traditionally, TE and its conditional variants are applied pairwise between dynamic variables to infer these causal relationships. However, identifying the most influential or vulnerable node in a system requires measuring the causal influence of each component on the entire system and vice versa. In this paper, I propose using outgoing and incoming transfer entropy-where outgoing TE quantifies the influence of a node on the rest of the system, and incoming TE measures the influence of the rest of the system on the node. The node with the highest outgoing TE is identified as the most influential, or "hub", while the node with the highest incoming TE is the most vulnerable, or "anti-hub". Since these measures involve transfer entropy between univariate and multivariate time series, naive estimation methods can result in significant errors, particularly when the number of variables is comparable to or exceeds the number of samples. To address this, I introduce a novel estimation scheme that computes outgoing and incoming TE only between significantly interacting partners. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by using synthetic data, and by applying it to real data of oral microbiota. The method successfully identifies the bacterial species known to be key players in the bacterial community, demonstrating the power of the new method.</description>
