      <title>A note on blinded continuous monitoring for continuous outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring is becoming more popular due to its significant benefits, including reducing sample sizes and reaching earlier conclusions. In general, it involves monitoring nuisance parameters (e.g., the variance of outcomes) until a specific condition is satisfied. The blinded method, which does not require revealing group assignments, was recommended because it maintains the integrity of the experiment and mitigates potential bias. Although Friede and Miller (2012) investigated the characteristics of blinded continuous monitoring through simulation studies, its theoretical properties are not fully explored. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by presenting the asymptotic and finite-sample properties of the blinded continuous monitoring for continuous outcomes. Furthermore, we examine the impact of using blinded versus unblinded variance estimators in the context of continuous monitoring. Simulation results are also provided to evaluate finite-sample performance and to support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Stacked SVD or SVD stacked? A Random Matrix Theory perspective on data integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern data analysis increasingly requires identifying shared latent structure across multiple high-dimensional datasets. A commonly used model assumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with a shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for estimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information across datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the datasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second approach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset, then aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally computes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they have not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which is of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and dimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty about which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their potential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the asymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop optimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals that while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case, optimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend our analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical algorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical guidance for method selection in practical data integration problems. Extensive numerical simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on genomic data corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Generalized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many causal and structural parameters in economics can be identified and estimated by computing the value of an optimization program over all distributions consistent with the model and the data. Existing tools apply when the data is discrete, or when only disjoint marginals of the distribution are identified, which is restrictive in many applications. We develop a general framework that yields sharp bounds on a linear functional of the unknown true distribution under i) an arbitrary collection of identified joint subdistributions and ii) structural conditions, such as (conditional) independence. We encode the identification restrictions as a continuous collection of moments of characteristic kernels, and use duality and approximation theory to rewrite the infinite-dimensional program over Borel measures as a finite-dimensional program that is simple to compute. Our approach yields a consistent estimator that is $\sqrt{n}$-uniformly valid for the sharp bounds. In the special case of empirical optimal transport with Lipschitz cost, where the minimax rate is $n^{2/d}$, our method yields a uniformly consistent estimator with an asymmetric rate, converging at $\sqrt{n}$ uniformly from one side.</description>

      <title>A quantum experiment with joint exogeneity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In randomized experiments, the assumption of potential outcomes is usually accompanied by the \emph{joint exogeneity} assumption. Although joint exogeneity has faced criticism as a counterfactual assumption since its proposal, no evidence has yet demonstrated its violation in randomized experiments. In this paper, we reveal such a violation in a quantum experiment, thereby falsifying this assumption, at least in regimes where classical physics cannot provide a complete description. We further discuss its implications for potential outcome modelling, from both practial and philosophical perspectives.</description>

      <title>Inference on Common Trends in a Cointegrated Nonlinear SVAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of performing inference on the number of common stochastic trends when data is generated by a cointegrated CKSVAR (a two-regime, piecewise-linear SVAR; Mavroeidis, 2021), using a modified version of the Breitung (2002) multivariate variance ratio test that is robust to the presence of nonlinear cointegration (of a known form). To derive the asymptotics of our test statistic, we prove a fundamental LLN-type result for a class of stable but nonstationary autoregressive processes, using a novel dual linear process approximation. We show that our modified test yields correct inferences regarding the number of common trends in such a system, whereas the unmodified test tends to infer a higher number of common trends than are actually present, when cointegrating relations are nonlinear.</description>

      <title>Estimating invertible processes in Hilbert spaces, with applications to functional ARMA processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invertible processes are central to functional time series analysis, making the estimation of their defining operators a key problem. While asymptotic error bounds have been established for specific ARMA models on $L^2[0,1]$, a general theoretical framework has not yet been considered. This paper fills in this gap by deriving consistent estimators for the operators characterizing the invertible representation of a functional time series with white noise innovations in a general separable Hilbert space. Under mild conditions covering a broad class of functional time series, we establish explicit asymptotic error bounds, with rates determined by operator smoothness and eigenvalue decay. These results further provide consistency-rate estimates for operators in Hilbert space-valued causal linear processes, including functional MA, AR, and ARMA models of arbitrary order.</description>

      <title>Jackknife Empirical Likelihood Ratio Test for Cauchy Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions, such as the Cauchy distribution, are acknowledged for providing more accurate models for financial returns, as the normal distribution is deemed insufficient for capturing the significant fluctuations observed in real-world assets. Data sets characterized by outlier sensitivity are critically important in diverse areas, including finance, economics, telecommunications, and signal processing. This article addresses a goodness-of-fit test for the Cauchy distribution. The proposed test utilizes empirical likelihood methods, including the jackknife empirical likelihood (JEL) and adjusted jackknife empirical likelihood (AJEL). Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed test. The application of the proposed test is illustrated through the analysing two real data sets.</description>

      <title>Testing hypotheses generated by constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02974v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-variables are nonnegative random variables with expected value at most one under any distribution from a given null hypothesis. Every nonasymptotically valid test can be obtained by thresholding some e-variable. As such, e-variables arise naturally in applications in statistics and operations research, and a key open problem is to characterize their form. We provide a complete solution to this problem for hypotheses generated by constraints -- a broad and natural framework that encompasses many hypothesis classes occurring in practice. Our main result is an abstract representation theorem that describes all e-variables for any hypothesis defined by an arbitrary collection of measurable constraints. We instantiate this general theory for three important classes: hypotheses generated by finitely many constraints, one-sided sub-$\psi$ distributions (including sub-Gaussian distributions), and distributions constrained by group symmetries. In each case, we explicitly characterize all e-variables as well as all admissible e-variables. Numerous examples are treated, including constraints on moments, quantiles, and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Building on these, we prove existence and uniqueness of optimal e-variables under a large class of expected utility-based objective functions used for optimal decision making, in particular covering all criteria studied in the e-variable literature to date.</description>

      <title>Bounding Conditional Value-at-Risk via Auxiliary Distributions with Bounded Discrepancies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for bounding the CVaR of a random variable $X$ using another related random variable $Y$, under assumptions on their cumulative and density functions. Our results yield practical tools for approximating $\operatorname{CVaR}_\alpha(X)$ when direct information about $X$ is limited or sampling is computationally expensive, by exploiting a more tractable or observable random variable $Y$. Moreover, the derived bounds provide interpretable concentration inequalities that quantify how the tail risk of $X$ can be controlled via $Y$.</description>

      <title>Mitigating loss of variance in ensemble data assimilation: machine learning-based and distance-free localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two new methods based/inspired by machine learning for tabular data and distance-free localization to enhance the covariance estimations in an ensemble data assimilation. The main goal is to enhance the data assimilation results by mitigating loss of variance due to sampling errors. We also analyze the suitability of several machine learning models and the balance between accuracy and computational cost of the covariance estimations. We introduce two distance-free localization techniques leveraging machine learning methods specifically tailored for tabular data. The methods are integrated into the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework. The results show that the proposed localizations improve covariance accuracy and enhance data assimilation and uncertainty quantification results. We observe reduced variance loss for the input variables using the proposed methods. Furthermore, we compare several machine learning models, assessing their suitability for the problem in terms of computational cost, and quality of the covariance estimation and data match. The influence of ensemble size is also investigated, providing insights into balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that certain machine learning models are more suitable for this problem. This study introduces two novel methods that mitigate variance loss for model parameters in ensemble-based data assimilation, offering practical solutions that are easy to implement and do not require any additional numerical simulation or hyperparameter tuning.</description>
