      <title>SUSY design of smooth quantum rings in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a suitable technique to design zero-energy graphene models with radial electrostatic potentials capable of achieving electrostatic confinement. Using the Gaussian law for electrostatics, we derive the charge density associated with these potentials that correspond to concentric electrostatic rings. The technique is based on a modified supersymmetric transformation that allows to design time-reversal invariant interaction terms and to find the corresponding zero-energy bound states in analytical form. Consequently, solutions with the same probability density but different angular momentum are characterized by circular probability currents flowing in opposite directions. The energies of the systems defined in two Dirac valleys (one-valley) have a fourfold (twofold) degeneracy. As an example of the technique, we construct a ring-decorated Coulomb potential that exhibits zero energy collapse and bound states together.</description>

      <title>Boundary-induced Majorana coupling in a planar topological Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding environmental effects in a topological Josephson junction is vital for identifying signatures of Majorana modes. We consider a planar Josephson junction formed on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, which possesses Majorana modes inside the junction and boundary modes outside. We find that tunneling between the inner and outer modes gives rise to effective coupling between the inner Majorana modes, and hence induces energy splitting of their states even in the absence of the direct spatial overlap of their wave functions. The energy splitting is obtained analytically in the weak tunneling limit and is numerically investigated for an arbitrary tunneling strength. We discuss in detail the evolution of the energy splitting with an external perpendicular magnetic field and its effect on the shape of the Fraunhofer pattern.</description>

      <title>Theory of Band Gap Reduction Due to Conduction Electrons in 2D TMDs: Imaginary Frequency Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two Dimensional (2D) Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess a large direct band gap which has been experimentally observed to shrink with increasing charge carrier density (doping). The effect has been the subject of theoretical study in recent years using various approaches and approximations. In this work we develop the theory of bandgap renormalization based on Feynman diagrammatic technique in the imaginary frequency formalism. We consider dynamical screening from conduction band electrons using the random phase approximation (RPA), as well as screening from a metallic gate. While our theory is general for any 2D semiconductor, to be specific we consider MoS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ and compare with available experimental data. In both cases we calculate large band gap renormalization that reaches several hundred meV at relatively low carrier density. This is in good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Spin-flip Scattering at the Chiral Interface of Helical Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-flip scattering processes of electrons when they pass a chiral interface, which is the boundary between right- and left-handed one-dimensional chain. We construct a minimal $p$-orbital model consisting of the right- and left-handed one-dimensional threefold helical chains connected at $z=0$ with the nearest neighbor hopping and the spin-orbit coupling. The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.</description>

      <title>The parametric instability landscape of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) hold promise as for the realization of neuromorphic and quantum computation. Yet, their rich bifurcation structure remains largely not understood. Here, we employ secular perturbation theory to map the stability regions of these networks, and identify the regime where the system can be mapped to an Ising model. Starting with two coupled KPOs, we show how the bifurcations arise from the competition between the global parametric drive and linear coupling between the KPOs. We then extend this framework to larger networks with all-to-all equal coupling, deriving analytical expressions for the full cascade of bifurcation transitions. In the thermodynamic limit, we find that these transitions become uniformly spaced, leading to a highly regular structure. Our results reveal the precise bounds under which KPO networks have an Ising-like solution space, and thus provides crucial guidance for their experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Resonant inter-mode second harmonic generation by backward spin waves in YIG nano-waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study nonlinear generation of the second harmonic by backward volume spin waves propagating in microscopic magnonic waveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator with a thickness of several tens of nanometers. We show that highly efficient resonant second harmonic generation is possible in the inter-mode regime at microwave powers of the order of 10^-4 W. In contrast to previously observed second harmonic generation processes, the generation by backward waves is characterized by the nonlinearly generated waves propagating opposite to the initial waves, and can be realized at zero bias magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Edge states and persistent current in a PT-symmetric extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with generic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) model by including next-nearest-neighbour(NNN) interaction and balanced loss-gain(BLG), and subjecting the whole system to an external uniform magnetic field. We study the band structure, edge states and persistent current in this extended SSH model under General Boundary Condition(GBC) of which the periodic and open boundary conditions appear as special cases. It is shown that the point band gap decreases with the increasing value of the strength of the NNN interaction and vanish beyond a critical value. Further, the line gap exhibits closed-loop like structures for non-vanishing NNN interaction under the Periodic Boundary Condition(PBC). We show that the NNN interaction has no effect on the persistent current in the half-filled limit for the case of PBC, while for other fillings less than the half-filling, it enhances the magnitude of the current significantly. We numerically study the variation of the persistent current with respect to the system parameters under the GBC, for the case the Hamiltonian admits entirely real spectra. We obtain analytic expressions for the edge states in the case of Open Boundary Condition(OBC) for vanishing NNN interaction.We show numerically for OBC that edge states in the topologically trivial phase appear for non vanishing NNN interaction only when the strength of the loss-gain term is greater than the modulus of the difference between the intercell and intracell hopping strengths. In the topologically non-trivial phase, the edge states under OBC exists only up to a critical value of the NNN strength and vanishes beyond this critical value. We show that the NNN interaction, the loss-gain and the boundary terms play a crucial role in the creation and destruction of edge states for the GBC.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity extraction of MoS$_2$ nanoribbons using THz nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nanoscale optical properties of high-quality MoS$_2$ nanoribbons are investigated using THz nanoscopy based on a scattering-type scanning probe. The nanoribbons comprise a multi-layer core, surrounded by monolayer edges. A featureless complex permittivity spectrum covering the range 0.6-1.6 THz is extracted from experimental time-domain measurements through a minimization procedure, adopting an extended finite-dipole model of the probe-sample interaction. Real-space mapping of the nanoribbon reveals variations in the local permittivity down to the instrument-limited resolution, on the order of 30 nm. Clustering analysis statistically identifies regions of lower apparent permittivity that we attribute to a high curvature at the edges of the nanoribbon causing an increase in local material strain or cross-talk in the measured signal with topography-induced measurement artifacts. The core of the nanoribbon contains two regions that follow tightly distributed, but slightly shifted Gaussian statistics in complex permittivity space, with the real part mean of both distributions lying around 5.4 and compatible with literature values of the static permittivity of thin-film MoS$_2$ reported previously. Our results show that the nanoribbons exhibit a modest degree of dielectric variation at the nanoscale that could be explained by heterogeneous doping or variations in the local defect density. We believe that our approach could be useful for the direct real-space measurement of dielectric disorder in other low-dimensional semiconducting material systems.</description>

      <title>Design and Benchmarks for Emulating Kondo Dynamics on a Quantum Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum simulation and the overall prospective of solving correlated many-electron problems using quantum algorithms, we design a gate-based quantum circuit that emulates the dynamics of the Kondo impurity model. We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Observation of Impurity-Induced Scale-Free Localization in a Disordered Non-Hermitian Electrical Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of unique features of non-Hermitian systems is the extreme sensitive to their boundary conditions, e.g., the emergence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under the open boundary conditions, where most of bulk states become localized at the boundaries. In the presence of impurities, the scale-free localization can appear, which is qualitatively distinct from the NHSE. Here, we experimentally design a disordered non-Hermitian electrical circuits in the presence of a single non-Hermitian impurity and the nonreciprocal hopping. We observe the anomalous scale-free accumulation of eigenstates, opposite to the bulk hopping direction. The experimental results open the door to further explore the anomalous skin effects in non-Hermitian electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Magnon cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit system via two-magnon driving and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ABACUS (Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at USTC) is an open-source software for first-principles electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. It mainly features density functional theory (DFT) and is compatible with both plane-wave basis sets and numerical atomic orbital basis sets. ABACUS serves as a platform that facilitates the integration of various electronic structure methods, such as Kohn-Sham DFT, stochastic DFT, orbital-free DFT, and real-time time-dependent DFT, etc. In addition, with the aid of high-performance computing, ABACUS is designed to perform efficiently and provide massive amounts of first-principles data for generating general-purpose machine learning potentials, such as DPA models. Furthermore, ABACUS serves as an electronic structure platform that interfaces with several AI-assisted algorithms and packages, such as DeePKS-kit, DeePMD, DP-GEN, DeepH, DeePTB, etc.</description>

      <title>Effect of spontaneous emission on a tanh model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of spontaneous emission on a tanh model. The effect is characterized by introducing an imaginary term and a shift in the model, resulting in its non-Hermitian nature. This leads to the appearance of light beams in the population evolution, primarily influenced by the coupling strength and the shift. We derive the necessary conditions to identify the allowed and forbidden regions in the diagram of the real part of the energy. Additionally, we analyze how sweep velocity and time affect the imaginary part of the energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the similarities between our model and the Rabi and Landau-Zener models. Throughout this work, we confirm that our theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Unconventional bias-dependent tunneling magnetoresistance in van der Waals ferromagnetic/semiconductor heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic/semiconductor heterojunctions represent an ideal platform for studying and exploiting tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effects due to the versatile band structure of semiconductors and their high-quality interfaces. In the all-vdW magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices, both the magnitude and sign of the TMR can be tuned by an applied voltage. Typically, as the bias voltage increases, first the amplitude of the TMR decreases, then the sign of the TMR reverses and/or oscillates. Here, we report on an unconventional bias-dependent TMR in the all-vdW Fe3GaTe2/GaSe/Fe3GaTe2 MTJs, where the TMR first increases, then decreases, and finally undergoes a sign reversal as the bias voltage increases. This dependence cannot be explained by traditional models of MTJs. We propose an in-plane electron momentum (k//) resolved tunneling model that considers both the coherent degree of k// and the decay of the electron wave function through the semiconductor spacer layer. This can explain well the conventional and unconventional bias-dependent TMR. Our results thus provide a deeper understanding of the bias-dependent spin-transport in semiconductor-based MTJs and offer new insights into semiconductor spintronics.</description>

      <title>Tunable anharmonicity in cavity optomechanics in the unresolved sideband regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing a controlled and strong anharmonicity in mechanical systems is a present challenge of nanomechanics. In cavity optomechanics a mechanical oscillator may be made anharmonic by ponderomotively coupling its motion to the light field of a laser-driven cavity. In the regime where the mechanical resonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared to the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a high-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly non-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead to a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator. We present a theory that predicts the measurable signatures left by the mechanical anharmonicity. In particular, we obtain analytically and numerically the mechanical displacement spectrum, and explore the imprints of the mechanical anharmonicity on the cavity light field.</description>

      <title>Topological Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconducting quantum rings</title>

Abstract: Quantum rings have emerged as a playground for quantum mechanics and topological physics, with promising technological applications. Experimentally realizable quantum rings, albeit at the scale of a few nanometers, are 3D nanostructures. Surprisingly, no theories exist for the topology of the Fermi sea of quantum rings, and a microscopic theory of superconductivity in nanorings is also missing. In this paper, we remedy this situation by developing a mathematical model for the topology of the Fermi sea and Fermi surface, which features non-trivial hole pockets of electronic states forbidden by quantum confinement, as a function of the geometric parameters of the nanoring. The exactly solvable mathematical model features two topological transitions in the Fermi surface upon shrinking the nanoring size either, first, vertically (along its axis of revolution) and, then, in the plane orthogonal to it, or the other way round. These two topological transitions are reflected in a kink and in a characteristic discontinuity, respectively, in the electronic density of states (DOS) of the quantum ring, which is also computed. Also, closed-form expressions for the Fermi energy as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring are provided. These, along with the DOS, are then used to derive BCS equations for the superconducting critical temperature of nanorings as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring. The $T_c$ varies non-monotonically with the dominant confinement size and exhibits a prominent maximum, whereas it is a monotonically increasing function of the other, non-dominant, length scale. For the special case of a perfect square toroid (where the two length-scales coincide), the $T_c$ increases monotonically with increasing the confinement size, and in this case, there is just one topological transition.</description>

      <title>Localization-Delocalization Transitions in Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm Cages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unique feature of non-Hermitian systems is the extreme sensitivity of the eigenspectrum to boundary conditions with the emergence of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). A NHSE originates from the point-gap topology of complex eigenspectrum, where an extensive number of eigenstates are anomalously localized at the boundary driven by nonreciprocal dissipation. Two different approaches to create localization are disorder and flat-band spectrum, and their interplay can lead to the anomalous inverse Anderson localization, where the Bernoulli anti-symmetric disorder induce mobility in a full-flat band system in the presence of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) Cage. In this work, we study the localization-delocalization transitions due to the interplay of the point-gap topology, flat band and correlated disorder in the one-dimensional rhombic lattice, where both its Hermitian and non-Hermitian structures show AB cage in the presence of magnetic flux. Although it remains the coexistence of localization and delocalization for the Hermitian rhombic lattice in the presence of the random anti-symmetric disorder, it surprisingly becomes complete delocalization, accompanied by the emergence of NHSE. To further study the effects from the Bernoulli anti-symmetric disorder, we found the similar NHSE due to the interplay of the point-gap topology, correlated disorder and flat bands. Our anomalous localization-delocalization property can be experimentally tested in the classical physical platform, such as electrical circuit.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Origin and Microscopic Mechanism of Electrical Magnetochiral Anisotropy in Tellurium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-linear transport effects in response to external magnetic fields, i.e. electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), have attracted much attention for their importance to study quantum and spin-related phenomena. Indeed, they have permitted the exploration of topological surface states and charge-to-spin conversion processes in low-symmetry systems. Nevertheless, despite the inherent correlation between the symmetry of the material under examination and its non-linear transport characteristics, there is a lack of experimental demonstration to delve into this relationship and to unveil their microscopic mechanisms. Here, we study eMChA in chiral elemental Tellurium (Te) along different crystallographic directions, establishing the connection between the different eMChA components and the crystal symmetry of Te. We observed different longitudinal eMChA components with collinear current and magnetic field, demonstrating experimentally the radial angular momentum texture of Te. We also measured a transverse non-linear resistance which, as the longitudinal counterpart, scales bilinearly with current and magnetic fields, illustrating that they are different manifestations of the same effect. Finally, we study the scaling law of the eMChA, evidencing that extrinsic scattering from dynamic sources is the dominant microscopic mechanism. These findings underscore the efficacy of symmetry-based investigations in understanding and predicting non-linear transport phenomena, with potential applications in spintronics and energy harvesting.</description>

Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Amplifying the antiferromagnetic spin Seebeck effect through topological magnons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological magnons emerge as topologically protected spin wave states at the edges of magnets. Here, we theoretically explore how these surface states can be harnessed to amplify the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in antiferromagnets (AFMs) interfaced with normal metals (NMs). Based on a microscopic model of a kagome AFM, we demonstrate that broken mirror symmetry, combined with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), drives the system into a topological phase hosting spin-polarized magnons at the boundaries. Notably, linear response calculations reveal that in AFM/NM heterostructures, the topological magnons exhibit strong coupling to the metal's charge carriers, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the SSE. The relative contribution of the topological magnons is found to be 4-5 times greater than that of the trivial magnon bands. Moreover, our results show that this enhancement is highly sensitive to the strength of the DMI.</description>

      <title>Role of asymmetry in thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot out of equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot system coupled to two metallic reservoirs, focusing on two main effects: (i) the influence of coupling asymmetry between the quantum dot and the reservoirs on the Seebeck coefficient, and (ii) the impact of asymmetry in the energy levels of the dots on current rectification. In the first case, we find that introducing moderate asymmetry significantly enhances the Seebeck coefficient. In the second case, while rectification vanishes when the energy levels are degenerate, substantial rectification is achieved when one energy level lies below and the other above the Fermi level. We further interpret the dependence of rectification magnitude and shape on system parameters using analytical results from a spinless model.</description>

      <title>Influence of carrier density and disorder on the Quantum Hall plateau widths in epitaxial graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since its discovery, graphene has been one of the most prominent 2D materials due to its unique properties and broad range of possible applications. In particular, the half-integer Quantum Hall Effect (HI-QHE) characterized by the quantization of Hall resistivity as a function of applied magnetic field, offers opportunities for advancements in quantum metrology and the understanding of topological quantum states in this 2D material. While the role of disorder in stabilizing quantum Hall plateaus (QHPs) is widely recognized, the precise interplay between the plateaus width, disorder, mobility and carrier density remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the width of the $\nu=6$ QHP in epitaxial graphene Hall bars, focusing on two distinct regions of the device with markedly different electronic mobilities. Depending on the storage conditions, it is possible to modify the carrier density of graphene QHE devices and consequently increase or reduce the mobility. Our experiments reveal mobility variations of up to 200$\%$ from their initial value. In particular, the sample storage time and ambient conditions cause also noticeable changes in the positions and extension of the QHPs. Our results show that the QHP extension for $\nu=6$ differs significantly between the two regions, influenced by both mobility and disorder, rather than solely by carrier density. Transport simulations based on the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism with Anderson disorder in a scaled model reveal the critical role of impurities in shaping graphene transport properties defining the extension of the QHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay between mobility, disorder, and quantum transport in graphene systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Periodically-Driven Dissipative Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), featured by the collapse of bulk-band eigenstates into the localized boundary modes of the systems, is one of most striking properties in the fields of non-Hermitian physics. Unique physical phenomena related to the NHSE have attracted a lot of interest, however, their experimental realizations usually require nonreciprocal hopping, which faces a great challenge in ultracold-atom systems. In this work, we propose to realize the NHSE in a 1D optical lattice by periodically-driven ultracold atoms in the presence of staggered atomic loss. By studying the effective Floquet Hamiltonian in the high-frequency approximation, we reveal the underlying mechanism for the periodic-driving-induced the NHSE. We found that the robust NHSE can be tuned by driving phase, which is manifested by the dynamical localization. Most remarkably, we uncover the periodic-driving-induced critical skin effect for two coupled chains with different driving phases, accompanied by the appearance of size-dependent topological in-gap modes. Our studies provide a feasible way for observing the NHSE and exploring corresponding unique physical phenomena due to the interplay of non-Hermiticity and many-body statistics in ultracold-atom systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ) at equilibrium, using linear response, an exact path integral technique and symmetry considerations. All three approaches independently lead to conclude that the superconducting - insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ, cannot exist. For all parameters, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We reveal that the UV cutoff of the resistor plays an unforeseen key role in these systems, and show that the erroneous prediction of an insulating state resulted in part from assuming it would not. We also explain why the RSJ physics differs from that of 1D quantum impurity problems. Our results fully support and confirm the experimental invalidation of this quantum phase transition by Murani et al. in 2020.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating magnetism and Pomeranchuk effect in multilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wave functions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG), in contrast, magnetism-manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavors[1-7]-originates from itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here, we show experimentally that the electronic entropy in this system shows signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments, unexpected for electrons in a fully itinerant metal. Specifically, we find a contribution $\Delta$ S $\approx$ 1k$_B$/charge carrier that onsets at the Curie temperature and survives over one order of magnitude in temperature. First order phase transitions show an isospin `Pomeranchuk effect' in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favored over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid[8, 9]. Our results imply that despite the itinerant nature of the electron wave functions, the spin- and valley polarization of individual electrons are decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He[10]. Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite temperature resistance minimum within the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two-dimensional flat band systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sodium niobate, a lead-free ferroic material, hosts delicately-balanced, competing order parameters, including ferroelectric states that can be stabilized by epitaxial strain. Here, we show that the resulting macroscopic ferroelectricity exhibits an unconventional microscopic structure using multislice electron ptychography. This technique overcomes multiple scattering artifacts limiting conventional electron microscopy, enabling both lateral spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit and recovery of three-dimensional structural information. These imaging capabilities allow us to separate the ferroelectric interior of the sample from the relaxed surface structure and identify the soft phonon mode and related structural distortions with picometer precision. Unlike conventional ferroelectric perovskites, we find that the polar distortion in this material involves minimal distortions of the cation sublattices and is instead dominated by anion displacements relative to the niobium sublattice. We establish limits on film thickness for interfacial octahedral rotation engineering and directly visualize a random octahedral rotation pattern, arising from the flat dispersion of the associated phonon mode.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, kagome materials have attracted significant attention due to their rich emergent phenomena arising from the quantum interplay of geometry, topology, spin, and correlations. However, in the search for kagome materials, it has been found that bulk compounds with electronic properties related to the kagome lattice are relatively scarce, primarily due to the hybridization of kagome layers with adjacent layers. Therefore, researchers have shown increasing interest in the discovery and construction of two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials, aiming to achieve clean kagome bands near the Fermi level in monolayer or few-layer systems. Substantial advancements have already been made in this area. In this review, we summarize the current progress in the construction and development of 2D kagome materials. We begin by introducing the geometric and electronic structures of the kagome lattice model and its variants, followed by discussions on the experimental realizations and electronic structure characterizations of 2D kagome materials. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future developments of 2D kagome materials.</description>

Abstract: Among the most significant macroscopic quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics is the Meissner effect observed in superconductivity, which arises from the unique interaction between superfluids of charged particles and electromagnetic fields. However, superfluids can also emerge from particles possessing distinct electromagnetic properties. In particular, there has been growing interest in superfluids composed of charge-neutral particles with magnetic or electric dipole moments, such as Bose-Einstein condensates of magnons or excitons. Despite this interest, the electromagnetic response of dipole superfluids, including potential analogs or contrasts to the Meissner effect, remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a Ginzburg-Landau phenomenological theory to describe magnetic and electric dipole superfluids subjected to pseudo-magnetic fields induced by geometric phases. For magnetic dipole superfluids interacting with the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase, we find that they form vortex lattices with sharply localized pseudo-magnetic fields along hexagonal domain walls, leading to singular and discontinuous change of physical variables at these boundaries. For electric dipole superfluids influenced by the He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) phase, in contrast, we identify vortex lattices where the pseudo-magnetic field and supercurrent are concentrated at vortex cores, resembling superconductors. These results reveal strikingly different electromagnetic responses in dipole superfluids, opening new directions for exploring superfluid systems with unconventional electromagnetic responses.</description>

      <title>Electron-irradiation effects on monolayer MoS2 at elevated temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of electron irradiation on 2D materials is an important topic, both for the correct interpretation of electron microscopy experiments and for possible applications in electron lithography. After the importance of including inelastic scattering damage in theoretical models describing beam damage, and the lack of oxygen-sensitivity under electron irradiation in 2D MoS2 were recently shown, the role of temperature has remained unexplored on a quantitative level. Here we show the effect of temperature on both the creation of individual defects as well as the effect of temperature on defect dynamics. Based on the measured displacement cross section of sulphur atoms in MoS2 by atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, we find an increased probability for defect creation for temperatures up to 150{\deg}C, in accordance with theoretical predictions. However, higher temperatures lead to a decrease of the observed cross sections. Despite this apparent decrease, we find that the elevated temperature does not mitigate the creation of defects as this observation would suggest, but rather hides the created damage due to rapid thermal diffusion of the created vacancies before their detection, leading to the formation of vacancy lines and pores outside the measurement's field of view. Using the experimental data in combination with previously reported theoretical models for the displacement cross section, we estimate the migration energy barrier of sulphur vacancies in MoS2 to be 0.26 +- 0.13 eV. These results mark another step towards the complete understanding of electron beam damage in MoS2.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</description>

      <title>Quantum Friction near the Instability Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an analytical framework to understand quantum friction across distinct stability regimes, providing approximate expressions for frictional forces both in the deep stable regime and near the critical threshold of instability. Our primary finding is analytical proof that, near the instability threshold, the quantum friction force diverges logarithmically. This result, verified through numerical simulations, sheds light on the behavior of frictional instabilities as the system approaches criticality.
  Our findings offer new insights into the role of instabilities, critical divergence and temperature in frictional dynamics across quantum and classical regimes.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary manifestation of near electrostatic field caused by macroscopic quantum shell effects in submicron hemispherical clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of macroscopic shell structure of submicron metal clusters is known for several decades. Since the most studies provide theoretical analysis for clusters of spherical shape, the electron density inhomogeneities caused by shell effects are spherically symmetric and do not provide long range electrostatic fields. However, similar shell structure should exist in a hemispherical cluster which conserves the closed periodic orbits of electrons, but not the spherical symmetry of electron distribution. As a result, we demonstrate that a strong electrostatic field ($E \sim 10^8$~V/m) exists in the vicinity of the flat surface of an isolated, uncharged metal nanocluster of hemispherical shape using modern approaches for electronic structure evaluation. This physical phenomenon is a consequence of the large-scale spatial inhomogeneity in distribution of electrons related to quantum shell effects in submicron metal clusters, which may find numerous applications in various fields of science and technology.</description>
