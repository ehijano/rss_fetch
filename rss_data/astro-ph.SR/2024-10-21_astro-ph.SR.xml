      <title>A search for self-lensing binaries with TESS and constraints on their occurrence rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five self-lensing binaries (SLBs) have been discovered with Kepler light curves. They contain white dwarfs (WDs) in AU-scale orbits that gravitationally lens solar-type companions. Forming SLBs likely requires common envelope evolution when the WD progenitor is an AGB star and has a weakly bound envelope. No SLBs have yet been discovered with data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which observes far more stars than Kepler did. Identifying self-lensing in TESS data is made challenging by the fact that TESS only observes most stars for $\sim$25 days at a time, so only a single lensing event will be observed for typical SLBs. TESS's smaller aperture also makes it sensitive only to SLBs a factor of $\sim$100 brighter than those to which Kepler is sensitive. We demonstrate that TESS has nevertheless likely already observed $\sim$4 times more detectable SLBs than Kepler. We describe a search for non-repeating self-lensing signals in TESS light curves and present preliminary candidates for which spectroscopic follow-up is ongoing. We calculate the sensitivity of our search with injection and recovery tests on TESS and Kepler light curves. Based on the 5 SLBs discovered with Kepler light curves, we estimate that $(1.1 \pm 0.6)\%$ of solar-type stars are orbited by WDs with periods of 100-1000 d. This implies a space density of AU-scale WD + main sequence (MS) binaries a factor of 20-100 larger than that of astrometrically-identified WD + MS binaries with orbits in Gaia DR3. We conclude that the Gaia sample is still quite incomplete, mainly because WD + MS binaries can only be unambiguously identified as such for high mass ratios.</description>

      <title>Orbits and masses in two triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an effort to determine accurate orbital and physical properties of a large number of bright stars, a method was developed to fit simultaneously stellar parameters (masses, luminosities, effective temperatures), distance, and orbits to the available data on multiple systems, namely the combined and differential photometry, positional measurements, radial velocities (RVs), accelerations, etc. The method is applied to a peculiar resolved triple system HIP 86286. The masses of its components estimated using observations and standard relations are 1.3, 0.9, and 0.9 Mmsun; the main star is a G8IV subgiant, while its two companions are main-sequence dwarfs. The inner and outer orbital periods are 35 and 287 years, respectively, and the orbits are nearly coplanar. The second system, HIP 117258, is an accelerating star with a resolved companion; its 35.7-yr orbit based on relative astrometry and precise RVs yields the secondary mass of 0.95 Msun, much larger than inferred from the photometry. The apparent paradox is explained by assuming that the secondary is a close pair of M-type dwarfs with yet unknown period.</description>

      <title>Quantifying systematic uncertainties in white dwarf cooling age determinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooling ages of white dwarfs are routinely determined by mapping effective temperatures and masses to ages using evolutionary models. Typically, the reported uncertainties on cooling ages only consider the error propagation of the uncertainties on the spectroscopically or photometrically determined $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. However, cooling models are themselves uncertain, given their dependence on many poorly constrained inputs. This paper estimates these systematic model uncertainties. We use MESA to generate cooling sequences of $0.5-1.0 M_{\odot}$ hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen cores under different assumptions regarding the chemical stratification of their core, the thickness of their helium envelope, their hydrogen content, and the conductive opacities employed in the calculations. The parameter space explored is constrained by the range of values predicted by a variety of stellar evolution models and inferred from asteroseismological studies. For a $0.6 M_{\odot}$ white dwarf, we find an uncertainty of 0.03 Gyr at 10,000 K (corresponding to a 5% relative uncertainty) and 0.8 Gyr at 4000 K (9%). This uncertainty is significant, as it is comparable to the age uncertainty obtained by propagating the measurement errors on $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass for a typical white dwarf. We also separately consider the potential impact of $^{22}$Ne shell distillation, which plausibly leads to an additional uncertainty of $\sim 1$ Gyr for crystallized white dwarfs. We provide a table of our simulation results that can be used to evaluate the systematic model uncertainty based on a white dwarf's $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. We encourage its use in all future studies where white dwarf cooling ages are measured.</description>

      <title>The red supergiant progenitor luminosity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of pre-explosion imaging has confirmed red supergiants (RSGs) as the progenitors to Type II-P supernovae (SNe). However, extracting the RSG's luminosity requires assumptions regarding the star's temperature or spectral type and the corresponding bolometric correction, circumstellar extinction, and possible variability. The robustness of these assumptions is difficult to test, since we cannot go back in time and obtain additional pre-explosion imaging. Here, we perform a simple test using the RSGs in M31, which have been well observed from optical to mid-IR. We ask the following: By treating each star as if we only had single-band photometry and making assumptions typically used in SN progenitor studies, what bolometric luminosity would we infer for each star? How close is this to the bolometric luminosity for that same star inferred from the full optical-to-IR spectral energy distribution (SED)? We find common assumptions adopted in progenitor studies systematically underestimate the bolometric luminosity by a factor of 2, typically leading to inferred progenitor masses that are systematically too low. Additionally, we find a much larger spread in luminosity derived from single-filter photometry compared to SED-derived luminosities, indicating uncertainties in progenitor luminosities are also underestimated. When these corrections and larger uncertainties are included in the analysis, even the most luminous known RSGs are not ruled out at the 3$\sigma$ level, indicating there is currently no statistically significant evidence that the most luminous RSGs are missing from the observed sample of II-P progenitors. The proposed correction also alleviates the problem of having progenitors with masses below the expected lower-mass bound for core-collapse.</description>

      <title>On Finding Black Holes in Photometric Microlensing Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are expected to be millions of isolated black holes in the Galaxy resulting from the death of massive stars. Measuring the abundance and properties of this remnant population would shed light on the end stages of stellar evolution and the evolution paths of black hole systems. Detecting isolated black holes is currently only possible via gravitational microlensing which has so far yielded one definitive detection. The difficulty in finding microlensing black holes lies in having to choose a small subset of events based on characteristics of their lightcurves to allocate expensive and scarce follow-up resources to confirm the identity of the lens. Current methods either rely on simple cuts in parameter space without using the full distribution information or are only effective on a small subsets of events. In this paper we present a new lens classification method. The classifier takes in posterior constraints on lightcurve parameters and combines them with a Galactic simulation to estimate the lens class probability. This method is flexible and can be used with any set of microlensing lightcurve parameters making it applicable to large samples of events. We make this classification framework available via the popclass python package. We apply the classifier to $\sim10,000$ microlensing events from the OGLE survey and find $23$ high-probability black hole candidates. Our classifier also suggests that the only known isolated black hole is an observational outlier according to current Galactic models and allocation of astrometric follow-up on this event was a high-risk strategy.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Common Envelope Ejection from Double Helium White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double helium white dwarfs (He WDs) are one type of gravitational wave source and are greatly important in the studies of binary interaction, particularly in the common envelope (CE) ejection physics. Most double He WDs with mass ratios of q~1 are formed through a particular channel. In this channel, one He WD is initially produced from a red giant (RG) with a degenerate core via stable Roche lobe overflow, and another He WD is formed from an RG with a degenerate core via CE ejection. They may have significant implications for the binary evolution processes yet have not received specific studies, especially for the CE phase. This paper adopts a semi-analytic method and a detailed stellar evolution simulation to model the formation of double He WDs. We find that most double He WDs show mass ratios being slightly greater than 1, and their orbital periods and mass ratios relation are broadly consistent with observations. There is also a relation between the mass ratios and the progenitors' masses of the He WDs produced via CE ejection for double He WDs with determined WD masses. Based on this relation, the mass of the He WD progenitor can be inferred from the mass ratio. Then, the CE ejection efficiency can be constrained with the orbital period. In addition, we constrain the CE ejection efficiency for two double He WDs, J1005-2249 and WD0957-666. The results show that the CE ejection efficiencies increase with the WD progenitor masses.</description>

      <title>Spectral evolution of hot hybrid white dwarfs I. Spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-rich white dwarfs (WDs) comprise the majority of the WD population, but are only rarely found at the very hot end of the WD cooling sequence. A small subgroup that exhibits both hydrogen and helium lines in their spectra, the so-called hybrid (or DAO) WDs, represents the majority of hydrogen-rich WDs at effective temperatures $T_{eff}$ $\approx$ 100 kK. We aim to understand the spectral evolution of hot hybrid WDs. Although small in number, they represent an evolutionary phase for most ($\approx$ 75 %) WDs. We conducted a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) analysis with fully metal line blanketed model atmospheres for the ultraviolet (UV) and optical spectra of a sample of 19 DA and 13 DAO WDs with $T_{eff}$ $&gt;$ 60 kK. The UV spectra allow us to precisely measure the temperature through model fits to metal lines in different ionization stages. This enables us to place the WDs accurately on the cooling sequence. In contrast to earlier studies that typically relied on temperature measurements made from hydrogen lines alone, all DAOs in our sample are clearly hotter than the DAs. DAOs transform into DAs when they cool to $T_{eff}$ $\approx$ 75$-$85 kK, depending on their mass. Along the cooling sequence, we witness a gradual decrease in the abundance of helium and the CNO elements in the DAOs due to gravitational settling. Simultaneously, iron and nickel abundances increase up to the transition region because radiative forces act more efficiently on them. This is followed by a steady decline. We discuss the implications of our results on atomic diffusion theory and on the role of weak radiation-driven winds in hot hydrogen-rich WDs.</description>

      <title>Gaia Data Release 3: spectroscopic binary-star orbital solutions and the SB1 processing chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia is an astrometric space experiment that is measuring positions, proper motions as well as parallaxes for a huge number of stars. It operates a medium-dispersion spectrometer, the RVS, that provides spectra and thus radial velocity time-series. The paper is centred on the analysis of the RV time-series. We try to fit orbital and trend models and restrict ourselves to the objects of spectral types F-G-K brighter than magnitude 12 presenting only one single spectrum (SB1). Suitable time-series are processed and analysed object per object, providing orbital or trend solutions. The results of the various fits are further filtered on the basis of several quality measures in order to discard spurious solutions. The objects only having a spectroscopic solution are classified in one of the three classes SB1 (eccentric model), SB1C (circular model) or TrendSB1 (mere trend model). We detail the methods used and describe the derived parameters and results. After a description of the models considered, and of the related quality tests of the fit, we detail the internal filtering that is intended to reject bad solutions. We also present a full validation of the pipeline. A description of the current content of the catalogue is provided. We present the SB1, SB1C and the TrendSB1 spectroscopic solutions contained in the SB-subcatalogue which is part of the DR3 catalogue. We delivered some 181327 orbital solutions in the class SB1, 202 in the class SB1C and 56808 in the associated class TrendSB1. This is a first release and the delivered SB-subcatalogue could be tuned and refined. However the majority of the entries are correct; this data set constitutes by far the largest set of spectroscopic orbital solutions ever constituted.</description>

      <title>X-raying the wind-wind collisions in HD 168112 and HD 167971</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The O-type long-period binary HD 168112 and triple HD 167971 star systems have been known for several decades for their non-thermal synchrotron radio emission. This emission arises from relativistic electrons accelerated in the hydrodynamic shocks of the wind collisions in these systems. Such wind collisions are expected to produce a strong X-ray emission that varies as a function of orbital phase. In wide eccentric binaries, such as our targets, the X-ray emission arises from an adiabatic plasma and its intensity should scale as the inverse of the orbital separation. We present a set of XMM-Newton observations of these systems which help us gain insight into the properties of their wind interactions.</description>

      <title>The effects of resistivity on oscillatory reconnection and consequences for solar flare Quasi Periodic Pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are often observed in flare emissions. While these may reveal much about the time-dependent reconnection involved in flare energy release, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this paper, we use 2D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the magnetic reconnection in two merging flux ropes, focusing on the effects of the resistivity on the time variation of the reconnection. We consider both uniform resistivity and current-dependent anomalous resistivity profiles. Our findings reveal that resistivity plays a critical role in controlling the reconnection dynamics, including reconnection rate oscillations and the rate of decay of the reconnection rate. Resistivity also influences the oscillations in emitted gyrosynchrotron radiation. However, in contrast to this strong influence of resistivity on reconnection rates, we observed a different behaviour for the emitted waves, whose frequencies are almost independent of resistivity variations.</description>

      <title>Spirals, rings, and vortices shaped by shadows in protoplanetary disks: from radiative hydrodynamical simulations to observable signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous protoplanetary disks exhibit shadows in scattered light observations. These shadows are typically cast by misaligned inner disks and are associated with observable structures in the outer disk such as bright arcs and spirals. Investigating the dynamics of the shadowed outer disk is therefore essential in understanding the formation and evolution of these structures. We carry out twodimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations that include radiative diffusion and dust-gas dynamics to study the formation of substructure in shadowed disks. We find that spiral arms are launched at the edge of each shadow, permeating the entire disk. The local dissipation of these spirals results in an angular momentum flux, opening multiple gaps and leading to a series of concentric, regularly-spaced rings We find that ring formation is favored in weakly turbulent disks where dust growth is taking place. These conditions are met for typical class-II disks, in which bright rings should form well within a fraction of their lifetime (0.1-0.2 Myr). For hotter disks gap opening is more efficient, such that the gap edges quickly collapse into vortices that can appear as bright arcs in continuum emission before decaying into rings or merging into massive, long-lived structures. Synthetic observations show that these structures should be observable in scattered light and millimeter continuum emission, providing a new way to probe the presence of substructure in protoplanetary disks. Our results suggest that the formation of rings and gaps is a common process in shadowed disks, and can explain the rich radial substructure observed in several protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Structure, maximum mass, and stability of compact stars in f(Q,T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physically based changes to general relativity (GR) often predict significant differences in how spacetime behaves near massive neutron stars. One of these modifications is represented by $f(\mathcal{Q}, { \mathcal{T}})$, with $\mathcal{Q}$ being the non-metricity and ${ \mathit{T}}$ representing the energy-momentum tensor trace. This theory is viewed as a neutral expansion of GR. Neutron stars weighing more than 1.8 times the mass of the Sun, when observed as radio pulsars, provide valuable opportunities to test fundamental physics under extreme conditions that are rare in the observable universe and cannot be replicated in experiments conducted on land. We derive an exact solution through utilizing the form $f(\mathcal{Q}, { \mathcal{T}})=\mathcal{Q}+\psi { \mathcal{T}}$, where $\psi$ represents a dimensional expression. We elucidate that all physical quantities within the star can be expressed using the dimensional parameter $\psi$ and the compactness, which is defined as $C=\frac{ 2GM}{Rc^2}$. We set $\psi$ to a maximum value of $\psi_1=\frac{\psi}{\kappa^2}=-0.04$ in the negative range, based on observational constraints related to radius and mass of the pulsar ${\textit SAX J1748.9-2021}$. Here, ${\mathrm \kappa^2}$ represents the coupling constant of Einstein, defined as ${\mathrm \kappa^2=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}}$. Unlike in GR, the solution we derived results in a stable compact object without violating the conjectured sound speed condition $c_s^2\leq\frac{c^2}3$.It is crucial to mention that no equations of state were assumed in this investigation. Nevertheless, our model fits nicely with linear form. Generally, when $\psi$ is negative, the theory predicts a star with a slightly larger size than GR for the same mass. The difference in predicted size between the theory with a negative $\psi$ and GR for the same mass is attributed to an additional force.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: popclass is a python package that provides a flexible, probabilistic framework for classifying the lens of a gravitational microlensing event. popclass allows a user to match characteristics of a microlensing signal to a simulation of the Galaxy to calculate lens type probabilities for an event. Constraints on any microlensing signal characteristics and any Galactic model can be used. popclass comes with an interface to common inference libraries for microlensing signal constraints, pre-loaded Galactic models, plotting functionality, and classification uncertainty quantification methods.</description>

      <title>HD 28185 Revisited: An Outer Planet, Instead of a Brown Dwarf, On a Saturn-like Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As exoplanet surveys reach ever-higher sensitivities and durations, planets analogous to the solar system giant planets are increasingly within reach. HD 28185 is a Sun-like star known to host a $m\sin i=6 M_J$ planet on an Earth-like orbit; more recently, a brown dwarf with a more distant orbit has been claimed. In this work we present a comprehensive reanalysis of the HD 28185 system, based on 22 years of radial velocity observations and precision Hipparcos-Gaia astrometry. We confirm the previous characterisation of HD 28185 b as a temperate giant planet, with its $385.92^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ day orbital period giving it an Earth-like incident flux. In contrast, we substantially revise the parameters of HD 28185 c; with a new mass of $m=6.0\pm0.6 M_J$ we reclassify this companion as a super-jovian planet. HD 28185 c has an orbital period of $24.9^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ years, a semi-major axis of $8.50^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$ AU, and a modest eccentricity of $0.15\pm0.04$, resulting in one of the most Saturn-like orbits of any known exoplanet. HD 28185 c lies at the current intersection of detection limits for RVs and direct imaging, and highlights how the discovery of giant planets at $\approx$10 AU separations is becoming increasingly routine.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic boundaries in kinematic and self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic simulations of precession-driven dynamo action in a closed cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically examine dynamo action generated by a flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a precessing cylindrical cavity. We compare a simplified kinematic approach based on the solution of the magnetic induction equation with a prescribed velocity field with the results from a self-consistent three-dimensional simulation of the complete set of magnetohydrodynamic equations. The different kinematic models show a strong influence of the electromagnetic properties of outer layers, which manifests itself in the existence of two different branches with dynamo action. In all cases, we observe a minimum for the onset of dynamo action in a transitional regime, within which the hydrodynamic flow undergoes a change from a large-scale to a more small-scale, turbulent behaviour. However, significant differences in the absolute values for the critical magnetic Reynolds number occur, and they can be explained by the low rotation rate in the MHD simulations achievable for technical reasons. In these models the character of the dynamo solution is small-scale and the magnetic energy remains significantly smaller than the kinetic energy of the flow. In irregular intervals, we observe dynamo bursts with a local concentration of the magnetic field, resulting in a global increase of the magnetic energy by a factor of 3 to 5. However, diffusion of the local patches caused by strong local shear is too rapid, causing these features to exist for only a short period (i.e., shorter than a rotation period) so that their dynamical impact on the dynamo remains small. As the magnetic field is small-scale and weak, the nonlinear feedback on the flow through the Lorentz force remains small and arises essentially in terms of a slight damping of the fast timescales, whereas there is no noticeable change in flow amplitude compared to the hydrodynamic case.</description>

      <title>Sputter Yields of the Lunar Surface: Experimental Validation and Numerical Modelling of Solar Wind Sputtering of Apollo 16 Soils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sputtering by solar wind ions is a key process driving the ejection of high-energy particles into the exospheres of airless bodies like asteroids, Mercury and the Moon. In view of upcoming missions which will deliver new in-situ data on these exospheres like the Artemis program at the Moon and BepiColombo at Mercury, a deeper understanding of sputtering effects is crucial. In this work, we combine sensitive quartz crystal microbalance measurements and numerical simulations to quantify sputter yields of Apollo soil 68501 under solar wind relevant conditions. We find that none of the commonly used simulation codes can reliably predict laboratory sputter yields without experimental benchmarks. All of the employed packages significantly overestimate the sputter yields of flat samples by at least a factor of 2 for the case of hydrogen. When accounting for surface roughness and regolith-like porosity, sputter yields are decreased even further to 7.3E-3 atoms\ion and 7.6E-2 atoms\ion for H and He at solar wind energies of 1 keV\amu, respectively. The reduced yields of porous regolith structures are largely independent of the ion incidence angle, making them applicable across a wide range of lunar latitudes. This study highlights the need for experimental validation of sputtering models to ensure accurate predictions for space weathering and lunar exosphere composition.</description>

      <title>Existence of slowly rotating bipolytropes with prolate cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of hydrostatic equilibrium states for a composite body made of two rigidly rotating, homogeneous layers bounded by spheroidal surfaces, where the core has a prolate shape. These new configurations require an oblate envelope that spins faster than the core. No solution with a prolate envelope is found. For some parameters, the prolate core can even be at rest. Numerical experiments based on the self-consistent field method support this result in the case of heterogeneous layers with polytropic equations of state. The possible cancellation of the first gravitational moment, $J_2$, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Constraining a relativistic mean field model using neutron star mass-radius measurements II: Hyperonic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether measurements of the neutron star mass and radius or the tidal deformability can provide information about the presence of hyperons inside a neutron star. This is achieved by considering two inference models, with and without hyperons, based on a field-theoretical approach. While current observations do not distinguish between the two scenarios, we have shown that data simulating expected observations from future large area X-ray timing telescopes could provide some information through Bayes factors. Inference using simulated data generated from an EOS containing hyperons decisively favours the hyperonic model over the nucleonic model. However, a 2\% uncertainty in the mass and radius determination may not be sufficient to constrain the parameters of the model when only six neutron star mass-radius measurements are considered.</description>

      <title>Enhanced extra mixing in low-mass stars approaching the RGB tip and the problem of Li-rich red-clump stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A few percent of red giants are enriched in Lithium with $A(\mathrm{Li}) &gt; 1.5$. Their evolutionary status has remained uncertain because these Li-rich giants can be placed both on the red-giant branch (RGB) near the bump luminosity and in the red clump (RC) region. However, thanks to asteroseismology, it has been found that most of them are actually RC stars. Starting at the bump luminosity, RGB progenitors of the RC stars experience extra mixing in the radiative zone separating the H-burning shell from the convective envelope followed by a series of convective He-shell flashes at the RGB tip, known as the He-core flash. The He-core flash was proposed to cause fast extra mixing in the stars at the RGB tip that is needed for the Cameron-Fowler mechanism to produce Li. We propose that the RGB stars are getting enriched in Li by the RGB extra mixing that is getting enhanced and begins to produce Li, instead of destroying it, when the stars are approaching the RGB tip. After a discussion of several mechanisms of the RGB extra mixing, including the joint operation of rotation-driven meridional circulation and turbulent diffusion, the Azimuthal Magneto-Rotational Instability (AMRI), thermohaline convection, buoyancy of magnetic flux tubes, and internal gravity waves, and based on results of (magneto-) hydrodynamics simulations and asteroseismology observations, we are inclined to conclude that it is the mechanism of the AMRI or magnetically-enhanced thermohaline convection, that is most likely to support our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Magnetometry: solving the fundamental ambiguity from line pair inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All magnetic field vector measurements lead to ambiguous results. We show that observations in two different lines belonging to the same multiplet but having different absorption coefficients so that they are formed at two different depths like Fe I 6302.5 A and 6301.5 A, enable the resolution of the azimuth ambiguity remaining from the Zeeman signal interpretation. What is measured by interpretation of the Zeeman effect is the magnetic field H, and not the divergence-free magnetic induction B. We analyze how the anisotropy of the photosphere, which is strongly stratified due to gravity and density at the star surface, affects divH and how the ambiguity resolution has to be performed in these conditions. As a consequence, two ambiguity-resolved field vector maps are obtained at two different but close altitudes, which enable the derivation of the current density full vector via curlH=J. This reveals the horizontal component of the current density, which is generally found markedly larger than the better known vertical one. We observe some systematical trends, of which we present examples in the paper, like circular currents wrapping spots clockwise about a positive polarity spot and anticlockwise about a negative polarity spot and strong horizontal current components crossing active region neutral lines. We finally remark that the Na I D1 and D2 lines form another such line pair. We propose them as an access to the low chromosphere where they are formed. However, a better spatial resolution for both observations and analysis would probably be necessary in such a medium.</description>

      <title>New Rotation Period Measurements for Kepler Stars Using Deep Learning: The 100K Sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new framework to predict stellar properties from light curves. We analyze the light-curve data from the Kepler space mission and develop a novel tool for deriving the stellar rotation periods for main-sequence stars. Using this tool, we provide the largest (108785 stars) and most accurate (an average error of $1.6$ Days) sample of stellar rotations to date. Our model, LightPred, is a novel deep-learning model designed to extract stellar rotation periods from light curves. The model utilizes a dual-branch architecture combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer components to capture both temporal and global features within the data. We train LightPred on a dataset of simulated light curves generated using a realistic spot model and enhance its performance through self-supervised contrastive pre-training on Kepler light curves. Our evaluation demonstrates that LightPred outperforms classical methods like the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) in terms of accuracy and robustness. We apply LightPred to the Kepler dataset, generating the largest catalog to date of stellar rotation periods for main-sequence stars. Our analysis reveals a systematic shift towards shorter periods compared to previous studies, suggesting a potential revision of stellar age estimates. We also investigate the impact of stellar activity on period determination and find evidence for a distinct period-activity relation. Additionally, we confirm tidal synchronization in eclipsing binaries with orbital periods shorter than 10 days. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning in extracting fundamental stellar properties from light curves, opening new avenues for understanding stellar evolution and population demographics.</description>

Abstract: We hereby reported a new physical binary cluster (ASCC~19 and ASCC~21) near the Orion star-forming complex based on the data in the literature. Analysis of the results shows that it is a primordial binary cluster. It is possible that this binary cluster is undergoing two-body relaxation by inspecting the radial velocity anomalies of its member stars. In addition, based on the analysis of its metal abundances, we found that the components of this binary cluster may have been formed by the deep fusion of multiple subclusters. Finally, we investigated the 3D morphology of this binary cluster, simulated the trajectories of its components in the galactic disk, and concluded that its components may not merge into a single cluster.</description>

      <title>Gaia BH1 and BH2 -- evolutionary models with overshooting of the black hole progenitors within the present-day binary separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three black holes (BHs) in wide binaries - Gaia BH1, BH2 and BH3 - were recently discovered. The likely progenitors of the BHs were massive stars that experienced a supergiant phase, reaching radii of ~1000 Rsun, before collapsing to form the BH. Such radii are difficult to accommodate with the present-day orbits of BH1 and BH2 - with semi-major axes of 1.4 and 3.7 au, respectively. In this letter, we show that the maximal radii of the supergiants are not necessarily so large, and realistic stellar evolution models, with some assumed overshooting above the convective core into the radiative stellar envelope, produce substantially smaller maximal radii. The limited expansion of supergiants is consistent with the empirical Humphreys-Davidson limit - the absence of red supergiants above an upper luminosity limit, notably lower than the highest luminosity of main-sequence stars. We propose that the evolution that led to the formation of Gaia BH1 and BH2 simply did not involve an expansion to the cool supergiant phase.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Chemical Composition of WD 1145+017: Impact of Circumstellar Disks Contamination on Photospheric Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a chemical analysis of the asteroid-bearing white dwarf WD 1145+017 using optical and ultraviolet spectroscopic data from 25 epochs between 2015 and 2023. We present an updated gas disk model with improved opacity calculations and temperature profiles to properly account for all circumstellar absorption features. Incorporating these changes into our models, we identified at least 10 elements in the disk, including a detection of circumstellar Na. We detected 16 elements in the photosphere, including new detections of P, Co and Cu. At 16 elements, WD 1145+017 ties GD 362 as one of the most polluted white dwarfs in terms of the number of elements detected. We find that both the disk and photosphere compositions align, to first order, with CI Chondrite. Our study underscores the importance of accounting for circumstellar absorption, as neglecting them leads to significant abundance errors. Additionally, the analysis of the disk's opacity highlighted a ultraviolet flux reduction due to a pseudo-continuum due to a optically thick component. This result may affect previous analyses of other polluted white dwarfs, suggesting a need for revisiting some studies.</description>

      <title>Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars: A Demonstration in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how near infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT J and K-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past $\sim8$ Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; $\sim3.3\times10^{7}$ stars with $M_{F814W} \lesssim +2$), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD ($\sim2.3\times10^{4}$ stars with $M_{J} \lesssim -5$). We find that only hundreds of AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo ($D_{M31, projected} \sim20-30$ kpc) using $\sim10^4$ AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's inner stellar halo from $4-5$ Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation $\sim1-2$ Gyr ago; (ii) a younger 'quenching time' in the vicinity of NGC 205 ($\sim1$ Gyr ago) than near M32 ($\sim1.6$ Gyr ago); (iii) $M_{\star}\sim4\pm0.5\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed over the past $\sim8$ Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs ($\sim13$ Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances ($D\gtrsim20$ Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.</description>
