      <title>The Determinants of Net Interest Margin in the Turkish Banking Sector: Does Bank Ownership Matter? Central Bank Digital Currencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presented an empirical investigation of the determinants of the net interest margin in Turkish Banking sector with a particular emphasis on the bank ownership structure. This study employed a unique bank-level dataset covering Turkey`s commercial banking sector for the 2001-2012. Our main results are as follows. Operation diversity, credit risk and operating costs are important determinants of margin in Turkey. More efficient banks exhibit lower margin and also price stability contributes to lower margin. The effect of principal determinants such as credit risk, bank size, market concentration and inflation vary across foreign-owned, state-controlled and private banks. At the same time, the impacts of implicit interest payment, operation diversity and operating cost are homogeneous across all banks</description>

      <title>Becoming Immutable: How Ethereum is Made</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze blocks proposed for inclusion in the Ethereum blockchain during 8 minutes on December 3rd, 2024. Our dataset comprises 38 winning blocks, 15,097 proposed blocks, 10,793 unique transactions, and 2,380,014 transaction-block pairings. We find that exclusive transactions--transactions present only in blocks proposed by a single builder--account for 85% of the fees paid by all transactions included in winning blocks. We also find that a surprisingly large number of user transactions are delayed: although proposed during a bidding cycle, they are not included in the corresponding winning block. Many such delayed transactions are exclusive to a losing builder. We also identify two arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX). By examining their bidding dynamics, we estimate that the implied price at which these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on CEXes is between 3.4 and 4.2 basis points better than the contemporaneous price reported on Binance.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic Persistence of Economic Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for modeling time-varying persistence in economic time series, allowing for smoothly evolving heterogeneity in shock dynamics. We leverage localized regression techniques to flexibly identify changes in persistence over time, offering a data-driven alternative to traditional parametric models. We applied this methodology to U.S. inflation and stock market volatility data and found substantial persistence variations that align with key macroeconomic events and market conditions. The results reveal previously undetected pockets of predictability and provide significant increases in out-of-sample forecast accuracy. These findings have important implications for economic modeling, forecasting, and policy analysis.</description>

      <title>The Surprising Irrelevance of Total-Value-Locked on Cryptocurrency Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common assumption in cryptocurrency markets is a positive relationship between total-value-locked (TVL) and cryptocurrency returns. To test this hypothesis we examine whether the returns of TVL-sorted portfolios can be explained by common cryptocurrency factors. We find evidence that portfolios formed on TVL exhibit returns that are linear functions of aggregate crypto market returns, that is they can be replicated with appropriate weights on the crypto market portfolio. Thus, strategies based on TVL can be priced with standard asset pricing tools. This result holds true both for total TVL and a simple TVL measure that removes a number of ways TVL may be overstated.</description>
