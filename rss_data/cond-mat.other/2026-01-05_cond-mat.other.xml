      <title>Interplay of electric and magnetic fields in skyrmion phases of the classical Heisenberg model on a square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stable spin textures, have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in information storage and processing. They are typically stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the presence of a magnetic field and can be manipulated by electric fields in magnetoelectric systems. Here we investigate, using Monte Carlo simulations, the behavior of skyrmions in a classical Heisenberg magnetoelectric model on the square lattice under combined magnetic and electric fields. We analyze spin and dipolar textures, structure factors, magnetization, chirality, and polarization for different field directions and magnitudes, identifying ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, spiral, skyrmion crystal, skyrmion gas, and bimeron phases, as well as the field-induced transitions between them. We find that the competition between electric and magnetic fields can destroy or transform skyrmion lattices into skyrmion-gas or bimeron phases. While magnetic fields induce chiral phases even in the presence of an electric field, electric fields strongly reshape the chiral region and deform skyrmion textures. This reciprocal influence between magnetic and electric orders reflects the intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling characteristic of multiferroic materials. Specifically, we observe the simultaneous sudden growth in magnetization with a switch-off in the polarization, typically observed in experiments. In this context, localized magnetoelectric entities, such as skyrmions carrying electric quadrupoles, exemplify the intertwined nature of spin and charge degrees of freedom, providing a microscopic basis for the control of topological states in ME systems and their potential use in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Helicity Locking of Bloch Skyrmions in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials exhibit Bloch-type spin textures with degenerate helicity states due to the absence of Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI), resulting in random nucleation and uncontrolled chirality. Here, we present a comprehensive micromagnetic study demonstrating a fully DMI free strategy for deterministic helicity control by interfacing ferromagnetic (FM) stripes or notch structures with centrosymmetric magnetic (CM) films. We first show that a geometrically constrained configuration comprising two FM stripes with opposite in-plane magnetizations stabilizes skyrmions with a selected helicity, either clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW). We further extend this concept to achieve deterministic nucleation of CW or CCW skyrmions using current pulses applied to an FM notch patterned on the CM film. The combined effects of the FM stripe/notch geometry and interfacial exchange coupling generate dipolar fields that lift the helicity degeneracy, enabling controlled formation of skyrmions with fixed chirality. These results establish FM/CM heterostructures as a robust, DMI-free platform for deterministic generation and guided motion of helicity-locked skyrmions, opening new pathways for advanced spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>The Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule as a consequence of a non-singular optical susceptibility in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn optical (TRK) sum rules for bulk materials have customarily been obtained by combining the Kramers-Kronig relations with the high frequency limit of the optical susceptibility tensor $\chi_{ij}$. Also, a non-singular expression for $\chi_{ij}$ involve the reduction of some its parts to an effective mass tensor. In this paper we show that the latter procedure is intimately connected to the TRK sum rules, and in fact these sum rules can be obtained from it. In reaching this result, we present before a thorough description of the momentum matrix elements of Bloch eigenfunctions bypassing the so-called $\bf{k}-$representation.</description>

      <title>A compellingly simple proof of the speed of sound for interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On physical grounds, one expects locally interacting quantum many-body systems to feature a finite group velocity. This intuition is rigorously underpinned by Lieb-Robinson bounds that state that locally interacting Hamiltonians with finite-dimensional constituents on suitably regular lattices always exhibit such a finite group velocity. This also implies that causality is always respected by the dynamics of quantum lattice models. It had been a long-standing open question whether interacting bosonic systems also feature finite speeds of sound in information and particle propagation, which was only recently resolved. This work proves a strikingly simple such bound for particle propagation - shown in literally a few elementary, yet not straightforward, lines - for generalized Bose-Hubbard models defined on general lattices, proving that appropriately locally perturbed stationary states feature a finite speed of sound in particle numbers.</description>

      <title>Massless graviton in de Sitter as second sound in two-fluid hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of gravitons and their masses, clear in the case of Minkowski spacetime, remains ambiguous for de Sitter spacetime. Here, we used a two-fluid approach to de Sitter thermodynamics and found a collective mode that is analogous to second sound in the two-fluid dynamics of the de Sitter state. This mode is massless and propagates at the speed of light. This suggests that this second-sound analog is a massless graviton propagating in de Sitter spacetime. The type of graviton this mode represents requires further consideration.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gate Dynamics Beyond the Rotating-Wave Approximation using Multi-Timescale Quantum Averaging Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary gate dynamics in driven quantum systems beyond the rotating-wave approximation. QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By accounting for the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate that high-fidelity two-qubit gates in strongly driven systems are achievable by going beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The QAT results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong coupling regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Averaging Theory for Multi-Timescale Driven Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-timescale Quantum Averaging Theory (QAT), a unitarity-preserving generalized Floquet framework for analytically modeling periodically and almost-periodically driven quantum systems across multiple timescales. By integrating the Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT captures the effects of both far-detuned and near-resonant interactions on system dynamics. The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of QAT results toward exact numerical solutions in both detuning regimes for touchstone problems in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of generalized squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing Hamiltonians corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.</description>
