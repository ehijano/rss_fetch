      <title>Hyperboloidal neutron star and black hole initial data in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this work is on the construction of initial data including a neutron star on a hyperboloidal slice. As simplest scenario for this first step, spherical symmetry is considered together with a polytropic-like equation of state for the neutron star. Constraint-satisfying hyperboloidal initial data are obtained for a single neutron star and for a combination of neutron star with a black hole in its center. To the author's best knowledge this is the first time that full hyperboloidal slices of a neutron star spacetime are constructed. The obtained initial data are suitable for evolutions of the Einstein and relativistic hydrodynamic equations on hyperboloidal slices.</description>

      <title>Stringent requirements for detecting light-induced gravitational effects using interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense laser fields have been proposed as a means to generate light-induced gravitational effects, providing a novel approach to investigate gravity and its coupling to electromagnetism in a controlled laboratory setting. In this article, a detection scheme based on interferometry is introduced to assess the feasibility of observing such effects. Initially, the space-time deformation and the resulting induced phase difference are evaluated in homogeneous electric fields. Using the theoretical minimum phase sensitivity bound -- a known result in quantum information -- and accounting for background signal coming from photon-photon scattering -- a fundamental quantum electrodynamics effect related to vacuum properties -- a set of stringent requirements for detectability is obtained. Then, a more realistic scenario is considered where gravitational effects are generated by an e-dipole pulse. In all cases considered, it is demonstrated that observing these effects presents significant challenges, even with the capabilities of current and foreseen laser infrastructures.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the light bending phenomenon for a pulsar in a binary with a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of light-bending on the signal of a pulsar in binaries with rotating black hole companions, focusing on stellar mass black holes. We show that the impacts of various parameters on the bending delays visually match with those observed for a non-rotating black holes, because the magnitude of the spin as well as the orientation of the spin axis of the black hole introduce changes in the nanosecond order and other parameters do so in the microsecond order. Consequently, the distortion of the beam and the resulting changes in the pulse shape are minimally influenced by spin-related parameters of the black hole. We also investigate the impact of various parameters on the difference of the delays with and without the spin of the black hole and notice nanosecond scale discontinuities at orbital phases where the path of the light ray changes its direction with respect to the direction of the spin of the black hole. Moreover, as in the Schwarzschild case, the bending delays become irregular (on the microsecond scale) near the superior conjunction. We also explore the effect of bending on the pulse profiles and bending delays if the companion of the pulsar is a rotating super-massive black hole. We find significant enhancement and change in the shape of the profiles at and near the superior conjunction in comparison to stellar mass black holes. Moreover, bending delays are about three orders of magnitude higher than those in case of the stellar mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Impact of the $(\ell=2,m=0)$ spherical harmonic mode with memory on parameter estimation for ground-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently presented an efficient and accurate waveform model for the $(2,0)$ spherical harmonic mode including both the displacement memory contribution and the ringdown oscillations for aligned-spin binary black holes in quasi-circular orbits. The model we developed is constructed in time domain and implemented within the computationally efficient IMRPhenomTHM waveform model. In this article, we employ it to perform in-depth parameter estimation studies for future ground-based detectors, specifically considering LIGO A$^{\#}$, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein Telescope, combining them in different detector networks. While previous studies have reviewed the impact of the memory contribution in parameter estimation, we assess the effect of incorporating the complete mode in the analysis on the posterior estimation of source parameters, performing zero-noise injections of high signal-to-noise ratio signals. We investigate the impact of this mode on the distance-inclination degeneracy and compare its impact in edge-on and face-on configurations. We find that including this mode helps mitigate biases in the estimation of individual spin components, which may otherwise arise when the mode is neglected.</description>

      <title>MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R &lt; 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers.</description>

      <title>Fractional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole with a fractal event horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the implementation of the fractional and non-local Wheeler--DeWitt (WDW) equation within the context of Schwarzschild geometry leads to the emergence of a Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black hole (BH), which is uniquely characterized by an event horizon that exhibits fractal properties and is defined by a non-integer dimension that lies in the continuum between the values of 1 and 2. Our calculations further reveal that this intriguing fractional BH may potentially possess a temperature that is substantially lower than that of a conventional BH, thereby suggesting a significant deviation from the expected thermodynamic properties of standard BHs. These remarkable characteristics, which are intrinsically linked to the non-integer dimensionality of the event horizon, likely arise from applying the Riesz fractional derivative as a sophisticated non-local operator, thus introducing fascinating dynamics into the theoretical framework of BH physics.</description>

      <title>Gravitomagnetism from Temporal Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00525v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the Taub-NUT metric can be envisaged as a (3+1) dimensional analog of the Kaluza-Klein (4+1) dimensional metric. After dimensional reduction of the Taub-NUT metric to (3) spatial dimensions, by treating time as the extra curled dimension (since the closed time-like curves can exist in the Taub-NUT framework, such a dimensional reduction is justified), we end up with three dimensional Einstein field equations plus the Maxwell equations for the gravitomagnetic field, which also acts as a source to Einstein field equations. Hence, the Taub-NUT metric unifies gravity and the NUT charge related gavitomagnetism in four dimensions, at the same footing the Kaluza-Klein metric unifies gravity and electromagnetism in five dimensions. We also find an interesting relation between the four dimensional gravitational constant and the Taub-NUT charge. The result is derived from classical field equations in Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption in Topological Solitons and the Emergence of an Effective Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the dynamics of particles and strings falling into smooth horizonless spacetimes that match the Schwarzschild black hole but replace its horizon with a smooth cap in supergravity. The cap consists of a regular topological structure formed by the deformations of extra compact dimensions. We show that infalling particles follow Schwarzschild-like trajectories down to the cap, but experience rapidly growing tidal forces that reach extreme values. In addition, infalling strings encounter a region of tidal instability localized at the cap, where transverse modes are excited. This stringy excitation drains their kinetic energy, resulting in tidal trapping. We demonstrate that the onset and strength of this instability depend sensitively on the Kaluza-Klein scale, the string scale, and the mass of the spacetime, ensuring that strings cannot escape the cap region. These results show that horizonless geometries can reproduce key features of black hole absorption while maintaining regularity at the horizon scale, offering compelling evidence for the emergence of effective horizon-like behavior from topological spacetime structures.</description>

      <title>Emulating compact binary population synthesis simulations with robust uncertainty quantification and model comparison: Bayesian normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Observational Insights on DBI K-essence Models Using Machine Learning and Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative observational data analysis of two DBI-type k-essence scalar field models for late-time cosmic acceleration: one treats dark energy with standard matter, while the other unifies dark energy and dark matter within a single scalar field, each governed by distinct non-canonical Lagrangians. The background dynamics are formulated via modified Friedmann and scalar field equations, constrained by Pantheon+ SNe Ia, Hubble, and BAO data, using Bayesian inference (NUTS in NumPyro) and a neural network-based emulator for efficiency. Introducing a nuisance parameter $\mu_0$ improves the robustness and interpretability of key cosmological parameters, particularly $H_0$, $r_d$, and $\Omega_{d0}$ by absorbing residual systematics, thereby mitigating the Hubble tension. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ is computed for both models, revealing key differences in cosmic acceleration history: Model I yields a present value $q^{Bayes}_0=-0.589$ or $q^{ML}_0=-0.559$ with transition redshift $z^{Bayes}_{trans}=0.740$ or $z^{ML}_{trans}=0.686$, closely aligning with $\Lambda$CDM predictions, while Model II shows a stronger present acceleration $q^{Bayes}_0=-0.893$ or $q^{ML}_0=-0.819$ but with a later transition at $z^{Bayes}_{trans}=0.605$ or $z^{ML}_{trans}=0.564$, indicating a steeper late time evolution. Based on $\chi^2$, $\chi^2_\nu$, AIC, and BIC statics, Model II performs worse than Model I despite its conceptual appeal. Finally, Symbolic regression (GPlearn) is performed to reconstructs $\omega_{eff}(z)$. Our analysis shows that Model I is statistically favored across all metrics and offers a physically consistent alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, capable of addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Exploration of features in the black hole mass spectrum inspired by non-parametric analyses of gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current gravitational-wave data reveal structures in the mass function of binary compact objects. Properly modelling and deciphering such structures is the ultimate goal of gravitational-wave population analysis: in this context, non-parametric models are a powerful tool to infer the distribution of black holes from gravitational waves without committing to any specific functional form. Here, we aim to quantitatively corroborate the findings of non-parametric methods with parametrised models incorporating the features found in such analyses. We propose two modifications of the currently favoured PowerLaw+Peak model, inspired by non-parametric studies, and use them to analyse the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogue. Our analysis marginally supports the existence of two distinct, differently redshift-evolving subpopulations in the black hole primary mass function, and suggests that, to date, we are still unable to robustly assess the shape of the mass ratio distribution for symmetric ($q&gt;0.7$) binaries.</description>

      <title>Representing Equations of State With Strong First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric representations of the high-density nuclear equation of state are used in constructing models for interpreting the astrophysical observations of neutron stars. This study explores how accurately equations of state with strong first-order phase transitions can be represented using spectral or piecewise analytic methods that assume no {\it{a priori}} knowledge of the location or the strength of the phase transition. The model equations of state used in this study have phase transitions strong enough to induce a gravitational instability that terminates the sequence of stable neutron stars. These equations of state also admit a second sequence of stable stars with core matter that has undergone this strong first-order phase transition (possibly driven by quark deconfinement). These results indicate that spectral representations generally achieve somewhat higher accuracy than piecewise analytic representations having the same number of parameters. Both types of representation show power-law convergence at approximately the same rate.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency with De Sitter Spacetime in a New Approach to Gravitational Particle Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the recent Physical Review Letter [1] which presents a new mechanism for particle production and black hole evaporation through a spatially dependent temperature. This new temperature is comparable to the Hawking result near the black hole, but is very small far away, and therefore could be a small correction. Here we apply the proposed reasoning to the case of de Sitter space, finding that it over predicts the de Sitter temperature of a minimally coupled scalar by factor of $\approx 4.3$ and over predicts the particle production rate by a factor of $\approx 52$. For non-minimally coupled scalars, it has other various problems; it predicts a negative particle production for conformal, or nearly conformal, coupled scalars; it predicts unsuppressed productions of heavy scalars. This all demonstrates an inconsistency in the proposed formalism.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\langle \Phi^2\rangle$ and quantum fluxes at the polar interior of a spinning black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Renormalization of physical quantities for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes can be achieved via the consistent subtraction of counterterms within a regularization scheme such as a point-splitting method. Pragmatic mode-sum regularization (PMR) is a point-splitting method which is particularly suitable for rotating black hole spacetimes. We extend and tailor the t-splitting variant of PMR specifically for the interior of a Kerr black hole on the axis of rotation, focusing on a minimally-coupled massless scalar field in the physically-motivated Unruh state. The method addresses unique challenges in the black hole interior that do not occur outside. In particular, while the infinite sum over multipolar number l converges in the black hole exterior, it diverges in the interior, necessitating the subtraction of a so-called intermediate divergence which includes introducing an additional "small" split in the direction of the polar angle. This procedure is outlined and justified, along with the standard PMR method's counterterms subtraction. We apply this method to calculate the renormalized energy-momentum fluxes $\langle T_{uu}\rangle^U_\text{ren}$, $\langle T_{vv}\rangle^U_\text{ren}$ (where u and v are the standard Eddington coordinates) and the renormalized field square $\langle \Phi^2\rangle^U_\text{ren}$ throughout the black hole interior, spanning from (just off) the event horizon to (just off) the inner horizon. Special emphasis is placed on the inner horizon vicinity, where our t-splitting results for the fluxes asymptote to those obtained directly at the inner horizon using a different method in a previous work. In an Appendix, we develop an alternative t-splitting PMR variant which does not include the intermediate divergence subtraction. We utilize it for independent computations that are used to verify the standard t-splitting variant presented in the main text.</description>

      <title>Revisiting semiclassical effective dynamics for quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revise the technique of semiclassical effective dynamics, in particular reexamining the evaluation of Poisson structure of the so-called central moments capturing quantum corrections, providing a systematic, pedagogical, and efficient algorithm for evaluation of said structure. The resulting closed formulae for Poisson brackets involve less summatios than recent results in the literature, thus being more optimal for applications. Found formulae are then applied to a general class of isotropic cosmological models with locally observable configuration variables for the admitted matter fields. In particular, this allowed to formulate a consistent and nontrivial limit or fiducial cell (infrared regulator) removal for models describing spatially noncompact spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal initial data without logarithmic singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Andersson and Chru\'sciel showed that generic asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets admit polyhomogeneous expansions, and that only a non-generic subclass of solutions of the conformal constraint equations is free of logarithmic singularities. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, within the evolutionary framework of the constraint equations, we show that the existence of a well-defined Bondi mass brings the asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets into a subclass whose Cauchy development guaranteed to admit a smooth boundary, by virtue of the results of Andersson and Chru\'sciel. Second, by generalizing a recent result of Beyer and Ritchie, we show that the existence of well-defined Bondi mass and angular momentum, together with some mild restrictions on the free data, implies that the generic solutions of the parabolic-hyperbolic form of the constraint equations are completely free of logarithmic singularities. We also provide numerical evidence to show that in the vicinity of Kerr, asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data without logarithmic singularities can indeed be constructed.</description>

      <title>Can spacetime fluctuations generate entanglement between co-moving accelerated detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies [Class. Quant. Grav. 42, 03LT01 (2025); Phys. Rev. D 111, 045023 (2025)] indicate that in a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum of former Rindler frame appears to be thermally populated for an observer in shifted Rindler frame. Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift parameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift parameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a set-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find that if their Rindler frames (consequently their trajectories) get infinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this entanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift parameter, provided it is non-vanishing. Further we observe the vanishing of mutual information and discord. It implies the absence of both classical and non-classical correlations which are not related to entanglement. We investigate the dependence of entanglement on acceleration of the detectors. The present study indicates that the entanglement between two detectors, moving on the same Rindler wedge, is possible. Moreover, small spacetime fluctuations can lead to entanglement between detectors, moving along same classical trajectory. Hence we feel that such theoretical prediction has potential to probe the Planck length nature of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Black hole absorption cross sections: Spin and Regge poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational fields propagating in the Schwarzschild black hole geometry. Using complex angular momentum techniques, we first derive a representation of the absorption cross section that separates it into smooth background integrals and a discrete Regge pole series. This decomposition reveals the physical mechanisms underlying black hole absorption, including classical capture, surface wave interference near the photon sphere, and subleading background effects. We then construct a refined high-frequency analytical approximation that captures both the dominant oscillations and the fine structure of the absorption spectra for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational fields, incorporating spin-dependent phase corrections and higher-order effects. In addition, we provide a simplified expression that generalizes the sinc approximation to describe the leading oscillations for electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Our analysis offers a unified semiclassical interpretation of black hole absorption, combining geometric optics, surface wave dynamics, and resonant phenomena encoded by the Regge pole structure.</description>

      <title>Light deflection in unified gravity and measurable deviation from general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light does not travel in a perfectly straight line when it passes near massive objects. Instead, it follows the curvature of spacetime as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we apply the gauge theory of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)], formulated as an extension of the Standard Model to include gravity. Using dynamical equations, we calculate gravitational deflection of light near astrophysical objects without need to use a curved metric. We do not use a single free parameter, and the ray optics method for the present problem is extremely accurate. The deflection angles obtained from unified gravity and general relativity are equal in the first power of the gravitational constant, which explains previous experiments. However, the second-order terms reveal a measurable relative difference of $1/15\approx6.7\%$. Therefore, experimentally differentiating between the two theories will become possible in the near future.</description>

      <title>Eye of the vortex: bound spectra in tunable horizonless rotational analogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the bound spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we utilize an analog vortex endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the spacetime of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon--characteristic of an acoustic black hole--for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the latter case, where the vortex flow is purely rotational, and compute the spectral properties of the analog system. The resulting bound-state spectrum is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of superfluid Helium giant quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime geometry used here holds significant potential to replicate the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the physical topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a thermodynamic formalism, within the particle-frame, for the energy-momentum tensor of irreversible anisotropic imperfect fluids subject to causality. Building on the Israel-Stewart extension of Eckart's theory, we further generalize these formalisms to incorporate anisotropic effects while ensuring the preservation of causality. In this framework, the second law of thermodynamics includes an additional term accounting for the system's anisotropy, which we derive explicitly in closed form for both first- and second-order theories. Notably, when anisotropy is removed, our model recovers Eckart's theory at first order and Israel-Stewart's at second order.</description>

Abstract: We present broadly applicable tools for determining the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors under the addition of self-adjoint operators and under the multiplication of unitaries, in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The new tools provide explicit non-perturbative expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. To illustrate the broad applicability of the new tools, we outline several applications, for example, to Shannon sampling in information theory. A longer companion paper applies the new tools to adiabatic quantum evolution, thereby shedding new light on the connection between an adiabatic quantum computation's usage of the resource of entanglement and the quantum computation's speed.</description>

      <title>The one-loop bispectrum of galaxies in redshift space from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the kernels and the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure counterterms for the one-loop bispectrum of dark matter and of biased tracers in real and redshift space. This requires the expansion of biased tracers up to fourth order in fluctuations. In the process, we encounter several subtleties related to renormalization. One is the fact that, in renormalizing the momentum, a local counterterm contributes non-locally. A second subtlety is related to the renormalization of local products of the velocity fields, which need to be expressed in terms of the renormalized velocity in order to preserve Galilean symmetry. We check that the counterterms we identify are necessary and sufficient to renormalize the one-loop bispectrum at leading and subleading order in the derivative expansion. The kernels that we originally present here have already been used for the first analyses of the one-loop bispectrum in BOSS data [1, 2].</description>

      <title>Halo Formation from Yukawa Forces in the Very Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where dark matter fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, dark stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at matter-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.</description>

      <title>Space-time-symmetric non-relativistic quantum mechanics: Time and position of arrival and an extension of a Wheeler-DeWitt-type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize a space-time-symmetric (STS) extension of non-relativistic quantum mechanics (QM) to describe a particle moving in three spatial dimensions. In addition to the conventional time-conditional (Schr\"odinger) wave function $\psi(x, y, z | t)$, we introduce space-conditional wave functions such as $\phi(t, y, z | x)$, where $x$ plays the role of the evolution parameter. The function $\phi(t, y, z | x)$ represents the probability amplitude for the particle to arrive on the plane $x = \text{constant}$ at time $t$ and transverse position $(y, z)$. Within this framework, the coordinate $x^\mu \in \{t, x, y, z\}$ can be conveniently chosen as the evolution parameter, depending on the experimental context under consideration. This leads to a unified formalism governed by a generalized Schr\"odinger-type equation, $\hat{P}^{\mu} |\phi^\mu(x^\mu)\rangle = -i\hbar \, \eta^{\mu\nu} \frac{d}{dx^\nu} |\phi^\mu(x^\mu)\rangle$. It reproduces standard QM when $x^\mu = t$, with $|\phi^0(x^0)\rangle = |\psi(t)\rangle$, and recovers the STS extension when $x^\mu = x^i \in \{x, y, z\}$. For a free particle, we show that $\phi(t, y, z | x) = \langle t, y, z | \phi(x) \rangle$ naturally reproduces the same dependence on the momentum wave function as the axiomatic Kijowski distribution. Possible experimental tests of these predictions are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate that the different states $|\phi^\mu(x^\mu)\rangle$ can emerge by conditioning (i.e., projecting) a timeless and spaceless physical state onto the eigenstate $|x^\mu\rangle$, leading to constraint equations of the form $\hat{\mathbb{P}}^\mu |\Phi^\mu\rangle = 0$. This formulation generalizes the spirit of the Wheeler-DeWitt-type equation: instead of privileging time as the sole evolution parameter, it treats all coordinates on equal footing.</description>

Abstract: We construct the first binary black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. The attractive force between the two black holes is balanced by the addition of a background electric field, sourced at the conformal boundary. There is a continuous family of bulk solutions for a given boundary profile and temperature, suggesting there is continuous non-uniqueness. We investigate the charges of the solutions and verify numerically that they satisfy a first law of black hole mechanics relation.</description>

      <title>Morphology of Relativistically Broadened Line Emission from Axisymmetric Equatorial Accretion Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-frequency emission from an accretion disk around a black hole is broadened into a line profile due to gravitational redshift and the motion of the disk's particles relative to the observer. The ensemble of relativistically broadened emission frequencies from the disk elements forms the spectrum viewed by an observer. Over the past decades, the broadened spectra of accreting systems have been used to constrain the spin of the black hole, the observer's inclination, and the astrophysical model parameters of the system. These inferences are usually made under the assumption that the accretion disk consists of particles orbiting around the black hole on stable circular orbits in the equatorial plane. Under this Standard disk model, in this work, we revisit line profile morphology, i.e., its extent, kinks, and fall-off. We provide a unified analytical explanation for these line profile morphological features, which encode the black hole spin, viewing inclination, and locations of the disk's inner and outer edges. We then show that these features, however, are model-dependent, by parametrically relaxing some of the astrophysical assumptions. In particular, we explore how allowing the disk particles to deviate from stable circular orbits rapidly degenerates the characteristic features of the line profile under the Standard disk model. Our results further demonstrate how sensitive our understanding of black hole and system properties can be to assumptions we make when interpreting these types of measurements.</description>

Abstract: Proposed experiments for obtaining empirical evidence for a quantum description of gravity in a table-top setting focus on detecting quantum information signatures, such as entanglement or non-Gaussianity production, in gravitationally interacting quantum systems. Here, we explore an alternative approach where the quantization of gravity could be inferred through measurements of macroscopic, thermodynamical quantities, without the need for addressability of individual quantum systems. To demonstrate the idea, we take as a case study a gravitationally self-interacting Bose gas, and consider its heat capacity. We find a clear-cut distinction between the predictions of a classical gravitational interaction and a quantum gravitational interaction in the heat capacity of the Bose gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

Abstract: We propose a method for demonstrating equivalences beyond the saddlepoint approximation between quantities in quantum gravity that are defined by the Euclidean path integral, without assumptions about holographic duality. The method involves three ingredients: (1) a way of resolving the identity with an overcomplete basis of microstates that is under semiclassical control, (2) a drastic simplification of the sum over topologies in the limit where the basis is infinitely overcomplete, and (3) a way of cutting and splicing geometries to demonstrate equality between two different gravitational path integrals even if neither can be explicitly computed. We illustrate our methods by giving a general argument that the thermal partition function of quantum gravity with two boundaries factorises. One implication of our results is that universes containing a horizon can sometimes be understood as superpositions of horizonless geometries entangled with a closed universe.</description>

      <title>Sphere amplitudes and observing the universe's size</title>

Abstract: Sine dilaton gravity is holographically related to DSSYK. We explain how to interpret sine dilaton as 2d quantum cosmology. This paves the way for using two copies of DSSYK as hologram for Big-Bang cosmologies. We study the most basic cosmological observable: the sphere amplitude. Via canonical quantization we find a finite answer that matches the on-shell action of a dual matrix integral. The sphere amplitude (or the norm of the no-boundary wavefunction) also gives a prediction for the universe's size. In the context of slow-roll inflation, the no-boundary state is non-normalizable, and predicts a small universe, in contradiction with experiments. We argue that an avatar of these issues exists in dS JT gravity. By considering sine dilaton as a UV completion of dS JT gravity, the state becomes normalizable. We then consider the observer's no-boundary state and show that this prefers neither small nor large universes. The resulting distribution is flat.</description>
