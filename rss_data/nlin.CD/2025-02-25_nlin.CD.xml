      <title>Deviations from Random Matrix Theory in quantum chaotic systems: A Perspective from Observable Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study deviations from random matrix theory (RMT) in quantum chaotic systems from a perspective of observable properties. Specifically, we focus on the envelope function of the off-diagonal elements of few-body observables written in the eigenbasis of a quantum chaotic manybody system, as introduced in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ansatz. Our objective is to understand the origin of the nontrivial structure of the envelope function in real systems and its connection to the distance of the system from a fully random system described by RMT. To this end, we introduce a method to systematically induce randomness into a real model, which eventually transitions into a random matrix model. Our numerical simulations of a defect Ising model show that the nontrivial structure of the envelope function of local spins becomes less pronounced as the randomness of the system increase, eventually disappearing when the system becomes fully random. Our results imply that the structure of the envelope function of few-body observables is closely related to the randomness of the system, which can be used to characterize the deviation from random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Induced Fluctuating Interfaces in Heterogeneously-Active Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of heterogeneous (spatially varying) activity in a hydrodynamical model for dense bacterial suspensions, confining ourselves to experimentally realizable, simple, quenched, activity patterns. We show that the evolution of the bacterial velocity field under such activity patterning leads to the emergence of hydrodynamic interfaces separating spatially localized turbulence from jammed frictional surroundings. We characterise the intermittent and multiscale fluctuations of this interface and also investigate how heterogeneity influences mixing via the residence times of Lagrangian tracers. This work reveals how naturally occurring heterogeneities could decisively steer active flows into more complex configurations than those typically studied, opening up parallels to droplet dynamics, front propagation and turbulent mixing layers.</description>

      <title>Extended Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the one-dimensional Cellular Automaton is extended to one that involves two sets of symbols and two global rules. As a main result, the Extended Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon Theorem is demonstrated. Such constructions can be useful in studying complex systems involving two related phenomena and provide a way to their co-study.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Bifurcations in Stochastic Non-Normal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We challenge the prevailing emphasis on bifurcations as the primary mechanism behind many abrupt changes in complex systems and propose an alternative, more universally applicable explanation based on non-normal dynamics. We demonstrate that linear or approximately linear stochastic systems near a dynamical attractor exhibit transient repulsive dynamics - termed pseudo-bifurcations - when interacting components are sufficiently asymmetric and hierarchically organized, i.e., non-normal. These pseudo-bifurcations produce early-warning signals commonly linked to bifurcations, such as dimension reduction, critical slowing down, and increased variance. Furthermore, we show that, as actual bifurcations approach, non-normal transients also emerge, complicating their distinction and potentially creating a bias that suggests the system is much closer to a critical point than it actually is. We support our analytical derivations by empirically demonstrating that the brain exhibits clear signs of such non-normal transients during epileptic seizures. Many systems suspected of approaching critical bifurcation points should be reconsidered, as non-normal dynamics offer a more generic explanation for the observed phenomena across natural, physical, and social systems.</description>

      <title>Streams and Graphs of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While studying gradient dynamical systems (DSs), Morse introduced the idea of encoding the qualitative behavior of a DS into a graph. Smale later refined Morse's idea and extended it to Axiom-A diffeomorphisms on manifolds. In Smale's vision, nodes are indecomposable closed invariant subsets of the non-wandering set with a dense orbit and there is an edge from node N to node M if the unstable manifold of N intersects the stable manifold of M. Since then, the decomposition of the non-wandering set was studied in many other settings, while the edges component of Smale's construction has been often overlooked. In the same years, more sophisticated generalizations of the non-wandering set were elaborated first by Auslander in 60s, by Conley in 70s and later by Easton and other authors. In our language, each of these generalizations involves the introduction of a closed and transitive extension of the non-wandering relation, that is closed but not transitive. In the present article, we develop a theory that generalizes at the same time both these lines of research. We study the general properties of closed transitive relations ("streams") containing the space of orbits of a discrete- or continuous-time semi-flow and we argue that these relations play a central role in the qualitative study of DSs. All most studied concepts of recurrence currently in literature can be defined in terms of our streams. Finally, we show how to associate to each stream a graph encoding its qualitative properties.
  The current revision fixes some proof, adds some missing one and adds some example and clarification.</description>
