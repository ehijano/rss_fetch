      <title>Global well-posedness and scattering in weighted space for nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations below the Strauss exponent without gauge-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a general homogeneous nonlinearity in dimensions up to three. We assume that the degree (i.e., power) of the nonlinearity is such that the equation is mass-subcritical and short-range. We establish global well-posedness (GWP) and scattering for small data in the standard weighted space for a class of homogeneous nonlinearities, including non-gauge-invariant ones. Additionally, we include the case where the degree is less than or equal to the Strauss exponent. When the nonlinearity is not gauge-invariant, the standard Duhamel formulation fails to work effectively in the weighted Sobolev space; for instance, the Duhamel term may not be well-defined as a Bochner integral. To address this issue, we introduce an alternative formulation that allows us to establish GWP and scattering, even in the presence of poor time continuity of the Duhamel term.</description>

      <title>Modified Wasserstein gradient flow formulation of time-fractional porous medium equations with nonlocal pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of time-fractional porous medium equations with nonlocal pressure. We show the existence of their weak solutions by proposing a JKO scheme for modified Wasserstein distance and a square fractional Sobolev norm. Moreover, the regularization effect and the Lp norm estimate are established in this paper.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal R$-bounded operator families arising from a compressible fluid model of Korteweg type with surface tension in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a resolvent problem arising from the free boundary value problem for the compressible fluid model of Korteweg type, which is called as the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system, with surface tension in the half-space. The Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system is known as a diffuse interface model for liquid-vapor two-phase flows. Our purpose is to show the $\mathcal R$-boundedness for the solution operator families of the resolvent problem, which gives us the maximal regularity estimates in the $L_p$-in-time and $L_q$-in-space setting by applying the Weis's operator valued Fourier multiplier theorem.</description>

      <title>On a class of coupled obstacle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore cooperative and competitive coupled obstacle systems, which, up to now, are new type obstacle systems and formed by coupling two equations belonging to classical obstacle problem. On one hand, applying the constrained minimizer in variational methods we establish the existence of solutions for the systems. Moreover, the optimal regularity of solutions is obtained, which is the cornerstone for further research on so-called free boundary. Furthermore, as coefficient $\lambda\to0$, there exists a sequence of solutions converging to solutions of the single classical obstacle equation. On the other hand, motivated by the heartstirring ideas of single classical obstacle problem, based on the corresponding blowup methods, Weiss type monotonicity formula and Monneau type monotonicity formula of systems to be studied, we investigate the regularity of free boundary, and on the regular and singular points in particular, as it should be, which is more challenging but exceedingly meaningful in solving free boundary problems.</description>

      <title>Phaseless uniqueness for determining internal source in photo-thermal effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates an inverse problem of recovering the internal source from external temperature measurements in photo-thermal effect. The photo-thermal effect actually involves two physical processes: electromagnetic scattering and heat transfer, described by a nonlinear coupled system of Maxwell's equation and the heat transfer equation. The nonlinear coupling term in the system is represented by the square of the modulus of the electromagnetic (missing the phase information of the electromagnetic field), and the absence of this phase information poses a significant challenge to the reconstruction of the internal source. In addition, the interaction and mutual influence of multiple physical fields, including electric field, magnetic field and temperature field, add to the complexity involved in the inversion of the internal source. Based on the potential theory and asymptotic analysis, we prove that the internal source can be uniquely determined up to sign by the external temperature field. This provides a solid theoretical basis for designing the internal source inversion algorithm and further exploring the theoretical aspects of photo-thermal effect.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and linearization for a semilinear wave equation with spatially growing nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the initial value problem for a defocusing semi-linear wave equation with spatially growing nonlinearity. Our analysis leads to global well-posedness in the energy space. Furthermore, we obtain the linearization of energy-bounded solutions using the methodology outlined in \cite{P.GR}. The proof hinges on Moser-Trudinger type inequalities and Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction for elastoplastic rods in the bending regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously derive an effective bending model for elastoplastic rods starting from three-dimensional finite plasticity. For the derivation we lean on a framework of evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence for rate-independent systems. The main contribution of this paper is an ansatz for the mutual recovery sequence in the bending regime. In difference to previous works that deal with infinitesimal deformations in the limit, in the bending regime we are concerned with finite deformations that admit infinitesimally small strain but large rotations. To overcome these difficulties we provide new ideas based on a multiplicative decomposition for the Cosserat rod ansatz. As regularizing terms, we introduce strain gradient terms into the energy that vanish as the thickness of the rod tends to zero.</description>

      <title>$\mathscr{A}$-free truncation and higher integrability of minimisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show higher integrability of minimisers of functionals
  \[
  I(u) = \int_{\Omega} f(x,u(x)) ~\mathrm{d}x
  \]
  subject to a differential constraint $\mathscr{A} u=0$ under natural $p$-growth and $p$-coercivity conditions for $f$ and regularity assumptions on $\Omega$. For the differential operator $\mathscr{A}$ we asssume a rather abstract truncation property that, for instance, holds for operators $\mathscr{A}=\mathrm{curl}$ and $\mathscr{A}=\mathrm{div}$. The proofs are based on the comparison of the minimiser to the truncated version of the minimiser.</description>

      <title>Mean flow velocities and mass transport for Equatorially-trapped water waves with an underlying current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of the mean flow velocities, and related mass transport, which are induced by certain Equatorially-trapped water waves. In particular, we examine a recently-derived exact and explicit solution to the geophysical governing equations in the $\beta-$plane approximation at the Equator which incorporates a constant underlying current.</description>

      <title>Equivalent formulations for steady periodic water waves of fixed mean-depth with discontinuous vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we prove the equivalence between three different weak formulations of the steady periodic water wave problem where the vorticity is discontinuous. In particular, we prove that generalised versions of the standard Euler and stream function formulation of the governing equations are equivalent to a weak version of the recently introduced modified-height formulation. The weak solutions of these formulations are considered in H\"older spaces.</description>

      <title>Another look at qualitative properties of eigenvalues using effective Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to review several qualitative properties of well-known eigenvalue problems using a different perspective based on the theory of effective Hamiltonians, working exclusively on the Hopf-Cole transform of the equation. We revisit some monotonicity results as well as the derivation of several scaling limits by means of the Donsker-Varadhan formula, and we point out several differences between the case of quadratic Hamiltonians and non-quadratic ones.</description>

      <title>Regularity results for minimizers of non-autonomous integral functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the higher fractional differentiability for the minimizers of non-autonomous integral functionals of the form \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}(u,\Omega):=\int_\Omega \left[ f(x,Du)- g \cdot u \right] dx , \notag \end{equation} under $(p,q)$-growth conditions. Besides a suitable differentiability assumption on the partial map $x \mapsto D_\xi f(x,\xi)$, we do not need to assume any differentiability assumption on the function $g$. Moreover, we show that the higher differentiability result holds true also assuming strict convexity and growth conditions on $f$ only at infinity.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Higher Order Sobolev Inequality on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ m, n $ be integers such that $ \frac{n}{2} &gt; m \geq 1 $ and let $ (M, g) $ be a closed $ n-$dimensional Riemannian manifold. We prove there exists some $ B \in \mathbb{R} $ depending only on $ (M, g) $, $ m $, and $ n $ such that for all $ u \in H_m^2(M) $, $$ \lVert u \rVert_{2^\#}^2 \leq K(m,n) \int_M (\Delta^\frac{m}{2} u)^2 dv_g + B \lVert u \rVert_{H_{m-1}^2(M)}^2 $$ where $ 2^\# = \frac{2n}{n-2m} $, $ K(m,n) $ is the square of the best constant for the embedding $ W^{m,2}(\mathbb{R}^n) \subset L^{2^\#}(\mathbb{R}^n) $, $ H_m^2(M) $ is the Sobolev space consisting of functions on $ M $ with $ m $ weak derivatives in $ L^2(M) $, and $ \Delta^\frac{m}{2} = \nabla \Delta^{\frac{m-1}{2}} $ if $ m $ is odd. This inequality is sharp in the sense that $ K(m,n) $ cannot be lowered to any smaller constant. This extends the work of Hebey-Vaugon and Hebey which correspond respectively to the cases $ m=1 $ and $ m=2 $.</description>

      <title>Some recent developments on isometric immersions via compensated compactness and gauge transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey recent developments on the analysis of Gauss--Codazzi--Ricci equations, the first-order PDE system arising from the classical problem of isometric immersions in differential geometry, especially in the regime of low Sobolev regularity. Such equations are not purely elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic in general, hence calling for analytical tools for PDEs of mixed types. We discuss various recent contributions -- in line with the pioneering works by G.-Q. Chen, M. Slemrod, and D. Wang [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. (2010); Comm. Math. Phys. (2010)] -- on the weak continuity of Gauss--Codazzi--Ricci equations, the weak stability of isometric immersions, and the fundamental theorem of submanifold theory with low regularity. Two mixed-type PDE techniques are emphasised throughout these developments: the method of compensated compactness and the theory of Coulomb--Uhlenbeck gauges.</description>

      <title>Uniform $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity for almost-minimizers of some nonlocal perturbations of the perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity theorem for almost-minimizers of the functional $\mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon,\gamma}=P-\gamma P_{\varepsilon}$, where $\gamma\in(0,1)$ and $P_{\varepsilon}$ is a nonlocal energy converging to the perimeter as $\varepsilon$ vanishes. Our theorem provides a criterion for $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity at a point of the boundary which is uniform as the parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to $0$. Since the two terms in the energy are of the same order when $\varepsilon$ is small, we are considering here much stronger nonlocal interactions than those considered in most related works. As a consequence of our regularity result, we obtain that, for $\varepsilon$ small enough, volume-constrained minimizers of $\mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon,\gamma}$ are balls. For small $\varepsilon$, this minimization problem corresponds to the large mass regime for a Gamow-type problem where the nonlocal repulsive term is given by an integrable $G$ with sufficiently fast decay at infinity.</description>

  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{n},n\geq 2$. As we will see, the presence of the boundary changes the usual form of the Modica estimate for entire solutions. We will also discuss the equality case. From such estimates we will deduce information about the curvature of $\partial \Omega$ under a certain condition on $\kappa$ and $f$. The proof uses the maximum principle together with scaling arguments and a careful passage to the limit in the arguments by contradiction.</description>

      <title>Maximizers of nonlocal interactions of Wasserstein type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the maximizers of a functional that involves the minimization of the Wasserstein distance between sets of equal volume. We prove that balls are the only maximizers by combining a symmetrization-by-reflection technique with the uniqueness of optimal transport plans. Further, in one dimension, we provide a sharp quantitative refinement of this maximality result.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of the Laplacian on closed manifolds and the heat asymptotics near conical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a smooth, closed and connected manifold of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$, endowed with a Riemannian metric $g$. Moreover, let $\mathcal{B}$ be an $(n+1)$-dimensional compact manifold with boundary equal to $\mathcal{M}$. Endow $\mathcal{B}$ with a Riemannian metric $h$ such that, in local coordinates $(x,y)\in [0,1)\times \mathcal{M}$ on the collar part of the boundary, it admits the warped product form $h=dx^{2}+x^{2}g(y)$. We consider the homogeneous heat equation on $(\mathcal{B},h)$ and find an arbitrary long asymptotic expansion of the solutions with respect to $x$ near $0$. It turns out that the spectrum of the Laplacian on $(\mathcal{M},g)$ determines explicitly the above asymptotic expansion and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Front propagation in hybrid reaction-diffusion epidemic models with spatial heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-species reaction-diffusion system in one space dimension that is derived from an epidemiological model in a spatially periodic environment with two types of pathogens: the wild type and the mutant. The system is of a hybrid nature, partly cooperative and partly competitive, but neither of these entirely. As a result, the comparison principle does not hold. We study spreading properties of solution fronts when the infection is localized initially. We show that there is a well-defined spreading speed and that it coincides with the minimal speed of the traveling waves. Next we study the case where the coefficients are spatially homogeneous and show that, when spreading occurs, every solution to the Cauchy problem converges to the unique positive stationary solution as $t\to\infty$. Finally we consider the case of rapidly oscillating coefficients, that is, when the spatial period of the coefficients, denoted by $\varepsilon$, is very small. We show that there exists a unique positive stationary solution, and that every positive solution to the Cauchy problem converges to this stationary solution as $t\to\infty$. We then discuss the homogenization limit as $\varepsilon\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Note on the existence of classical solutions of derivative semilinear models for one dimensional wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is a supplement with a new result to the review paper by Takamura [13] on nonlinear wave equations in one space dimension. We are focusing here to the long-time existence of classical solutions of semilinear wave equations in one space dimension, especially with derivative nonlinear terms of product-type. Our result is an extension of the single component case, but it is meaningful to provide models as possible as many to cover the optimality of the general theory. The proof is based on the classical iteration argument of the point-wise estimate of the solution.</description>

      <title>Convergence and non-convergence in a nonlocal gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic convergence of solutions as $t\rightarrow\infty$ of $\partial_t u=-f(u)+\int f(u)$, a nonlocal differential equation that is formally a gradient flow in a constant-mass subspace of $L^2$ arising from simplified models of phase transitions. In case the solution takes finitely many values, we provide a new proof of stabilization that uses a {\L}ojasiewicz-type gradient inequality near a degenerate curve of equilibria. Solutions with infinitely many values in general need not converge to equilibrium, however, which we demonstrate by providing counterexamples for piecewise linear and cubic functions $f$. Curiously, the exponential rate of convergence in the finite-value case can jump from order $O(1)$ to arbitrarily small values upon perturbation of parameters.</description>

      <title>The total Q-curvature, volume entropy and polynomial growth polyharmonic functions (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our previous work (Advances in Mathematics 450 (2024), Paper No. 109768). In this paper, we characterize complete metrics with finite total Q-curvature as normal metrics for all dimensional cases. Secondly, we introduce another volume entropy to provide geometric information regarding complete non-normal metrics with finite total Q-curvature. In particular, we show that if the scalar curvature is bounded from below, the volume growth of such complete metrics is controlled.</description>
