      <title>Machine Learning Visualization Tool for Exploring Parameterized Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the computational study of shock hydrodynamics, i.e. problems involving compressible solids, liquids, and gases that undergo large deformation. These problems are dynamic and nonlinear and can exhibit complex instabilities. Due to advances in high performance computing it is possible to parameterize a hydrodynamic problem and perform a computational study yielding $\mathcal{O}\left({\rm TB}\right)$ of simulation state data. We present an interactive machine learning tool that can be used to compress, browse, and interpolate these large simulation datasets. This tool allows computational scientists and researchers to quickly visualize "what-if" situations, perform sensitivity analyses, and optimize complex hydrodynamic experiments.</description>

      <title>NeuralSCF: Neural network self-consistent fields for density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) has found widespread application in accurate electronic structure calculations. However, it can be computationally demanding especially for large-scale simulations, motivating recent efforts toward its machine-learning (ML) acceleration. We propose a neural network self-consistent fields (NeuralSCF) framework that establishes the Kohn-Sham density map as a deep learning objective, which encodes the mechanics of the Kohn-Sham equations. Modeling this map with an SE(3)-equivariant graph transformer, NeuralSCF emulates the Kohn-Sham self-consistent iterations to obtain electron densities, from which other properties can be derived. NeuralSCF achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in electron density prediction and derived properties, featuring exceptional zero-shot generalization to a remarkable range of out-of-distribution systems. NeuralSCF reveals that learning from KS-DFT's intrinsic mechanics significantly enhances the model's accuracy and transferability, offering a promising stepping stone for accelerating electronic structure calculations through mechanics learning.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for tsunami inundation modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use physics-informed neural networks for solving the shallow-water equations for tsunami modeling. Physics-informed neural networks are an optimization based approach for solving differential equations that is completely meshless. This substantially simplifies the modeling of the inundation process of tsunamis. While physics-informed neural networks require retraining for each particular new initial condition of the shallow-water equations, we also introduce the use of deep operator networks that can be trained to learn the solution operator instead of a particular solution only and thus provides substantial speed-ups, also compared to classical numerical approaches for tsunami models. We show with several classical benchmarks that our method can model both tsunami propagation and the inundation process exceptionally well.</description>

      <title>A hybrid quantum-classical framework for computational fluid dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Great progress has been made in quantum computing in recent years, providing opportunities to overcome computation resource poverty in many scientific computations like computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this work, efforts are made to exploit quantum potentialities in CFD, and a hybrid classical and quantum computing CFD framework is proposed to release the power of current quantum computing. In this framework, the traditional CFD solvers are coupled with quantum linear algebra libraries in weak form to achieve collaborative computation between classical and quantum computing. The quantum linear solver provides high-precision solutions and scalable problem sizes for linear systems and is designed to be easily callable for solving linear algebra systems similar to classical linear libraries, thus enabling seamless integration into existing CFD solvers. Some typical cases are performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed framework and the correctness of quantum linear algorithms in CFD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16639v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deterministic-stochastic coupling scheme is developed for simulating rarefied gas flows, where the key process is the alternative solving of the macroscopic synthetic equations [Su et al., J. Comput. Phys., 407 (2020) 109245] and the mesoscopic equation via the asymptotic-preserving time-relaxed Monte Carlo scheme [Fei, J. Comput. Phys., 486 (2023) 112128]. Firstly, the macroscopic synthetic equations are exactly derived from the Boltzmann equation, incorporating not only the Newtonian viscosity and Fourier thermal conduction laws but also higher-order constitutive relations that capture rarefaction effects; the latter are extracted from the stochastic solver over a defined sampling interval. Secondly, the macroscopic synthetic equations, with the initial field extracted from the stochastic solver over the same sampling interval, are solved to the steady state or over certain iteration steps. Finally, the simulation particles in the stochastic solver are updated to match the density, velocity, and temperature obtained from the macroscopic synthetic equations. Moreover, simulation particles in the subsequent interval will be partly sampled according to the solutions of macroscopic synthetic equations. As a result, our coupling strategy enhances the asymptotic-preserving characteristic of the stochastic solver and substantially accelerates convergence towards the steady state. Several numerical tests are performed, and it is found that our method can reduce the computational cost in the near-continuum flow regime by two orders of magnitude compared to the direct simulation Monte Carlo method.</description>

Abstract: Neutron-Transformer Reflectometry and Advanced Computation Engine (N-TRACE ), a neural network model using transformer architecture, is introduced for neutron reflectometry data analysis. It offers fast, accurate initial parameter estimations and efficient refinements, improving efficiency and precision for real-time data analysis of lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction for electrochemical ammonia synthesis, with relevance to other chemical transformations and batteries. Despite limitations in generalizing across systems, it shows promises for the use of transformers as the basis for models that could replace trial-and-error approaches to modeling reflectometry data.</description>

      <title>Catalysis in Extreme Field Environments: The Case of Strongly Ionized $SiO_{2}$ Nanoparticle Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15602v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High electric fields can significantly alter catalytic environments and the resultant chemical processes. Such fields arise naturally in biological systems but can also be artificially induced through localized excitations at nanoscale. Recently, strong field excitation of dielectric nanoparticles has emerged as an avenue for studying catalysis in highly ionized environments producing extreme electric fields. While the dynamics of surface ion emission driven by ultrafast laser ionization has been heavily explored, understanding the molecular dynamics leading to fragmentation has remained elusive. To address this, we employed a multiscale approach utilizing non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NAQMD) simulations on hydrogenated silica surfaces in both bare and wetted environments under field conditions mimicking those of an ionized nanoparticle. Our findings indicate that hole localization drives fragmentation dynamics, leading to surface silanol dissociation within 50 fs and charge transfer-induced water splitting in wetted environments within 150 fs. Further insight into such ultrafast mechanisms is critical for advancement of catalysis on the surface of charged nanosystems.</description>

Abstract: Within the expansive domain of optical sciences, achieving the precise characterization of light beams stands as a fundamental pursuit, pivotal for various applications, including telecommunications and imaging technologies. This study introduces an innovative methodology aimed at reconstructing the Wigner distribution function of optical signals; a crucial tool in comprehending the time-frequency behavior exhibited by these signals. The proposed approach integrates two robust mathematical tools: the discrete realization of fractional Fourier transform, and the propagator of the quantum harmonic oscillator in waveguide arrays. This integration offers a direct and efficient method for characterizing optical signals by reconstructing their Wigner distribution function in the scope of integrated optics. We provide evidence of how having knowledge of the signal propagation amid the phase-space reconstruction, has desirable advantages in respect to only knowing the signal state.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study of frustrated Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions in generalized triangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model with nearest-neighbor interaction $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ in two kinds of generalized triangular lattices (GTLs) employing the Wang--Landau Monte Carlo method and finite-size scaling analysis. In the first GTL (GTL1), featuring anisotropic properties, we identify three kinds of super-antiferromagnetic ground states with stripe structures. Meanwhile, in the second GTL (GTL2), which is non-regular in next-nearest-neighbor interaction, the ferrimagnetic 3$\times$3 and two kinds of partial spin liquid ground states are observed. We confirm that residual entropy is proportional to the number of spins in the partial spin liquid ground states. Additionally, we construct finite-temperature phase diagrams for ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. In GTL1, the transition into the ferromagnetic phase is continuous, contrasting with the first-order transition into the stripe phase. In GTL2, the critical temperature into the ferromagnetic ground state decreases as antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interaction intensifies until it meets the 3$\times$3 phase boundary. For intermediate values of the next-nearest-neighbor interaction, two successive transitions emerge: one from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase, followed by the other transition from the ferromagnetic phase to the 3$\times$3 phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Can Quantum Computers Do Nothing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing platforms are subject to contradictory engineering requirements: qubits must be protected from mutual interactions when idling ('doing nothing'), and strongly interacting when in operation. If idling qubits are not sufficiently protected, information can 'leak' into neighbouring qubits, become non-locally distributed, and ultimately inaccessible. Candidate solutions to this dilemma include patterning-enhanced many-body localization, dynamical decoupling, and active error correction. However, no information-theoretic protocol exists to actually quantify this information loss due to internal dynamics in a similar way to e.g. SPAM errors or dephasing times. In this work, we develop a scalable, flexible, device non-specific protocol for quantifying this bitwise idle information loss based on the exploitation of tools from quantum information theory. We implement this protocol in over 3500 experiments carried out across 4 months (Dec 2023 - Mar 2024) on IBM's entire Falcon 5.11 series of processors. After accounting for other sources of error, and extrapolating results via a scaling analysis in shot count to zero shot noise, we detect idle information leakage to a high degree of statistical significance. This work thus provides a firm quantitative foundation from which the protection-operation dilemma can be investigated and ultimately resolved.</description>

      <title>Jacobian-Scaled K-means Clustering for Physics-Informed Segmentation of Reacting Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces Jacobian-scaled K-means (JSK-means) clustering, which is a physics-informed clustering strategy centered on the K-means framework. The method allows for the injection of underlying physical knowledge into the clustering procedure through a distance function modification: instead of leveraging conventional Euclidean distance vectors, the JSK-means procedure operates on distance vectors scaled by matrices obtained from dynamical system Jacobians evaluated at the cluster centroids. The goal of this work is to show how the JSK-means algorithm -- without modifying the input dataset -- produces clusters that capture regions of dynamical similarity, in that the clusters are redistributed towards high-sensitivity regions in phase space and are described by similarity in the source terms of samples instead of the samples themselves. The algorithm is demonstrated on a complex reacting flow simulation dataset (a channel detonation configuration), where the dynamics in the thermochemical composition space are known through the highly nonlinear and stiff Arrhenius-based chemical source terms. Interpretations of cluster partitions in both physical space and composition space reveal how JSK-means shifts clusters produced by standard K-means towards regions of high chemical sensitivity (e.g., towards regions of peak heat release rate near the detonation reaction zone). The findings presented here illustrate the benefits of utilizing Jacobian-scaled distances in clustering techniques, and the JSK-means method in particular displays promising potential for improving former partition-based modeling strategies in reacting flow (and other multi-physics) applications.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics with the MARTINI "Lego" approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MARTINI is a popular coarse-grained force-field that is mainly used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is based on the ``Lego'' approach where intermolecular interactions between coarse-grained beads representing chemical units of different polarity are obtained through water--octanol partition coefficients. This enables the simulation of a wide range of molecules by only using a finite number of parametrized coarse-grained beads, similar to the Lego game, where a finite number of bricks are used to create larger structures. Moreover, the MARTINI force-field is based on the Lennard-Jones potential with the shortest possible cutoff including attractions, thus rendering it very efficient for MD simulations. However, MD simulation is in general a computationally expensive method. Here, we demonstrate that using the MARTINI ``Lego'' approach is suitable for many-body dissipative particle (MDPD) dynamics, a method that can simulate multi-component and multi-phase soft matter systems in a much faster time (about 4--7 times) than MD. In this study, a DPPC lipid bilayer is chosen to provide evidence for the validity of this approach and various properties are compared to highlight the potential of the method. Thus, we anticipate that our study opens new possibilities for faster simulations of a wide range of soft matter systems by using the MDPD method.</description>

      <title>Consensus-based construction of high-dimensional free energy surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One essential problem in quantifying the collective behaviors of molecular systems lies in the accurate construction of free energy surfaces (FESs). The main challenges arise from the prevalence of energy barriers and the high dimensionality. Existing approaches are often based on sophisticated enhanced sampling methods to establish efficient exploration of the full-phase space. On the other hand, the collection of optimal sample points for the numerical approximation of FESs remains largely under-explored, where the discretization error could become dominant for systems with a large number of collective variables (CVs). We propose a consensus sampling-based approach by reformulating the construction as a minimax problem which simultaneously optimizes the function representation and the training set. In particular, the maximization step establishes a stochastic interacting particle system to achieve the adaptive sampling of the max-residue regime by modulating the exploitation of the Laplace approximation of the current loss function and the exploration of the uncharted phase space; the minimization step updates the FES approximation with the new training set. By iteratively solving the minimax problem, the present method essentially achieves an adversarial learning of the FESs with unified tasks for both phase space exploration and posterior error-enhanced sampling. We demonstrate the method by constructing the FESs of molecular systems with a number of CVs up to 30.</description>

      <title>Corner cases of the tau method: symmetrically imposing boundary conditions on hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polynomial spectral methods produce fast, accurate, and flexible solvers for broad ranges of PDEs with one bounded dimension, where the incorporation of general boundary conditions is well understood. However, automating extensions to domains with multiple bounded dimensions is challenging because of difficulties in imposing boundary conditions at shared edges and corners. Past work has included various workarounds, such as the anisotropic inclusion of partial boundary data at shared edges or approaches that only work for specific boundary conditions. Here we present a general system for imposing boundary conditions for elliptic equations on hypercubes. We take an approach based on the generalized tau method, which allows for a wide range of boundary conditions for many different spectral schemes. The generalized tau method has the distinct advantage that the specified polynomial residual determines the exact algebraic solution; afterwards, any stable numerical scheme will find the same result. We can, therefore, provide one-to-one comparisons to traditional collocation and Galerkin methods within the tau framework. As an essential requirement, we add specific tau corrections to the boundary conditions, in addition to the bulk PDE, which produce a unique set of compatible boundary data at shared subsurfaces. Our approach works with general boundary conditions that commute on intersecting subsurfaces, including Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and any combination of these on all boundaries. The boundary tau corrections can be made hyperoctahedrally symmetric and easily incorporated into existing solvers. We present the method explicitly for the Poisson equation in two and three dimensions and describe its extension to arbitrary elliptic equations (e.g. biharmonic) in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Local primordial non-Gaussianity from the large-scale clustering of photometric DESI luminous red galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use angular clustering of luminous red galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys to constrain the local primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $\fnl$. Our sample comprises over 12 million targets, covering 14,000 square degrees of the sky, with redshifts in the range $0.2&lt; z &lt; 1.35$. We identify Galactic extinction, survey depth, and astronomical seeing as the primary sources of systematic error, and employ linear regression and artificial neural networks to alleviate non-cosmological excess clustering on large scales. Our methods are tested against simulations with and without $\fnl$ and systematics, showing superior performance of the neural network treatment. The neural network with a set of nine imaging property maps passes our systematic null test criteria, and is chosen as the fiducial treatment. Assuming the universality relation, we find $\fnl = 34^{+24(+50)}_{-44(-73)}$ at 68\%(95\%) confidence. We apply a series of robustness tests (e.g., cuts on imaging, declination, or scales used) that show consistency in the obtained constraints. We study how the regression method biases the measured angular power-spectrum and degrades the $\fnl$ constraining power. The use of the nine maps more than doubles the uncertainty compared to using only the three primary maps in the regression. Our results thus motivate the development of more efficient methods that avoid over-correction, protect large-scale clustering information, and preserve constraining power. Additionally, our results encourage further studies of $\fnl$ with DESI spectroscopic samples, where the inclusion of 3D clustering modes should help separate imaging systematics and lessen the degradation in the $\fnl$ uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free Ergodicity of Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06510v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum thermal average plays a central role in describing the thermodynamic properties of a quantum system. Path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) is a prevailing approach for computing quantum thermal averages by approximating the quantum partition function as a classical isomorphism on an augmented space, enabling efficient classical sampling, but the theoretical knowledge of the ergodicity of the sampling is lacking. Parallel to the standard PIMD with $N$ ring polymer beads, we also study the Matsubara mode PIMD, where the ring polymer is replaced by a continuous loop composed of $N$ Matsubara modes. Utilizing the generalized $\Gamma$ calculus, we prove that both the Matsubara mode PIMD and the standard PIMD have uniform-in-$N$ ergodicity, i.e., the convergence rate towards the invariant distribution does not depend on the number of modes or beads $N$.</description>

      <title>Improving physics-informed DeepONets with hard constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current physics-informed (standard or deep operator) neural networks still rely on accurately learning the initial and/or boundary conditions of the system of differential equations they are solving. In contrast, standard numerical methods involve such conditions in computations without needing to learn them. In this study, we propose to improve current physics-informed deep learning strategies such that initial and/or boundary conditions do not need to be learned and are represented exactly in the predicted solution. Moreover, this method guarantees that when a deep operator network is applied multiple times to time-step a solution of an initial value problem, the resulting function is at least continuous.</description>

      <title>An unstructured geometrical un-split VOF method for viscoelastic two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since viscoelastic two-phase flows arise in various industrial and natural processes, developing accurate and efficient software for their detailed numerical simulation is a highly relevant and challenging research task. We present a geometrical unstructured Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method for handling two-phase flows with viscoelastic liquid phase, where the latter is modeled via generic rate-type constitutive equations and a one-field description is derived by conditional volume averaging of the local instantaneous bulk equations and interface jump conditions. The method builds on the plicRDF-isoAdvector geometrical VOF solver that is extended and combined with the modular framework DeboRheo for viscoelastic computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A piecewise-linear geometrical interface reconstruction technique on general unstructured meshes is employed for discretizing the viscoelastic stresses across the fluid interface. DeboRheo facilitates a flexible combination of different rheological models with appropriate stabilization methods to address the high Weissenberg number problem.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scalability of Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices for Ground State Preparation through Adaptive Finer Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a domain where quantum computers have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts due to their inherent quantum behavior. One of the main challenges of such quantum algorithms is up-scaling the system size, which is necessary to achieve meaningful quantum advantage. In this work, we present an approach to improve the scalability of eigenspace filtering for the ground state preparation of a given Hamiltonian. Our method aims to tackle limitations introduced by a small spectral gap and high degeneracy of low energy states. It is based on an adaptive sequence of eigenspace filtering through Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) followed by spectrum profiling. By combining our proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art phase estimation methods, we achieved good approximations for the ground state energy with local, two-qubit gate depolarizing probability up to $10^{-4}$. To demonstrate the key results in this work, we ran simulations with the transverse-field Ising Model on classical computers using Qiskit. We compare the performance of our approach with the static implementation of QETU and show that we can consistently achieve three to four orders of magnitude improvement in the absolute error rate.</description>

      <title>Multi-Derivative Runge-Kutta Flux Reconstruction for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the fourth order, two stage Multi-Derivative Runge Kutta (MDRK) scheme to the Flux Reconstruction (FR) framework by writing both stages in terms of a time averaged flux and then using the approximate Lax-Wendroff procedure to compute the time averaged flux. Numerical flux is carefully constructed to enhance Fourier CFL stability and accuracy. A subcell based blending limiter is developed for the MDRK scheme which ensures that the limited scheme is provably admissibility preserving. Along with being admissibility preserving, the blending scheme is constructed to minimize dissipation errors by using Gauss-Legendre solution points and performing MUSCL-Hancock reconstruction on subcells. The accuracy enhancement of the blending scheme is numerically verified on compressible Euler's equations, with test cases involving shocks and small-scale structures.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Novel Silicon Allotropes with Optimized Band Gaps to Enhance Solar Cell Efficiency through Evolutionary Algorithms and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advancing solar energy technologies, this study presents 20 direct and quasi-direct band gap silicon crystalline semiconductors that satisfy the Shockley-Queisser limit, a benchmark for solar cell efficiency. Employing two evolutionary algorithm-based searches, we optimize structures and calculate fitness function using the DFTB method and Gaussian approximation potential. Following the preselection of structures based on energy considerations, we further optimize them using PBEsol DFT. Subsequently, we screen the structures based on their band gap, employing a DFTB method tailored for band gap calculation of silicon crystals. To validate the structural stability, we employ phonon analysis via linear regression algorithm applied to PBEsol DFT data. To ensure accurate band gap determination, we employ HSE and GW methods. Significantly, the structures unveiled in this study are of great importance due to their proven stability from both mechanical and dynamic perspectives. Furthermore, the ductility and low density of certain structures enhance their potential application. Moreover, the study harnesses various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for the band gap energy of these silicon structures. Input data for machine learning models are derived from structural MBTR and SOAP descriptors, as well as DFT outputs. Notably, the results reveal that features extracted from DFT outperform the MBTR and SOAP descriptors.</description>
