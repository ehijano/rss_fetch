      <title>The role of the Lorentz force in sunspot equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspots survive on the solar surface for time-scales ranging from days to months. This requires them to be in an equilibrium involving magnetic fields and hydrodynamic forces. Unfortunately, theoretical models of sunspot equilibrium are very simplified as they assume that spots are static and possess a self-similar and axially symmetric magnetic field. These assumptions neglect the role of small scale variations of the magnetic field along the azimuthal direction produced by umbral dots, light bridges, penumbral filaments, and so forth. We aim at studying whether sunspot equilibrium is maintained once azimuthal fluctuations in the magnetic field, produced by the sunspot fine structure, are taken into account. To this end we apply the FIRTEZ Stokes inversion code to spectropolarimetric observations to infer the magnetic and thermodynamic parameters in two sunspots located at disk center and observed with two different instruments: one observed from the ground with the 1.5-meter German GREGOR Telescope and another with the Japanese spacecraft Hinode. We compare our results with three dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a sunspot carried out with the MuRAM code. We infer clear variations in the gas pressure and density of the plasma directly related to fluctuations in the Lorentz force and associated with the filamentary structure in the penumbra. Similar results are obtained in the umbra despite its lack of observed filamentary structure. Results from the two observed sunspots are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations. Our results indicate that the magnetic topology of sunspots along the azimuthal direction is very close to magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, thereby helping to explain why sunspots are such long-lived structures capable of surviving on the solar surface for days or even full solar rotations.</description>

      <title>The incidence of magnetic cataclysmic variables can be explained by the late appearance of white dwarf magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming that white dwarf (WD) magnetic fields are generated by a crystallization- and rotation-driven dynamo, the impact of the late appearance of WD magnetic fields in cataclysmic variables (CVs) has been shown to potentially solve several long-standing problems of CV evolution. However, recent theoretical works show that the dynamo idea might not be viable and that the late appearance of WD magnetic fields might be an age effect rather than related to the cooling of the core of the WD. We investigated the impact of the late appearance of WD magnetic fields on CV evolution assuming that the fields appear at fixed WD ages. We performed CV population synthesis with the BSE code to determine the fractions of CVs that become magnetic atcdifferent evolutionary stages. These simulations were complemented with MESA tracks that take into account the transfer of spin angular momentum to the orbit which can cause a detached phase. We find that the observed fraction of magnetic CVs as a function of orbital period is well reproduced by our simulations, and that in many CVs the WD should become magnetic close to the period minimum. The detached phase generated by the transfer of spin angular momentum is longest for period bouncers. Interpreting the late appearance of strong WD magnetic fields as a simple age effect naturally explains the relative numbers of magnetic CVs in observed samples. As many period bouncers might detach for several gigayears, the late appearance of WD magnetic fields at a fixed age and independent of the core temperature of the WD can significantly reduce the predicted number of accreting period bouncers.</description>

      <title>Relationship between prominence eruptions and coronal mass ejections during solar cycle 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the relationship between prominence eruptions (PEs) and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from May 2010 to December 2019 covering most of solar cycle 24. We used data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for PEs and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) for CMEs. We identified 1225 PEs, with 67% being radial, 32% transverse, and 1% failed PEs. The radial, transverse PEs, and the combined set have average speeds of ~53, 9, and 38 km/s, respectively. The PE association with CMEs is examined by assigning a confidence level (CL) from 0 (no association) to 3 (clear association). Out of 1225 PEs, 662 (54%) are found to be associated to CMEs including CL 1, 2, and 3. Our study reveals that the spatial and temporal relationships between PEs and CMEs vary over the solar cycle. During solar minima, CMEs tend to deflect towards the equator, possibly due to a stronger polar field. Temporal offsets are larger during solar maxima and smaller during the minima. This implies that the PEs appear in LASCO C2 FOV earlier during the minima than during the maxima. Among the 662 CMEs associated with PEs, 78% show clear bright core structures. Investigation of the morphological and temporal behavior of these CMEs indicate that the prominences evolves into CME cores at higher altitudes suggesting that PEs and CME cores are the same structure. The average speeds of the PEs, CME core, and CME leading edge are 62, 390, and 525 km/s, respectively. The speed of CME cores are more than the speed of PEs because the former are observed at larger heights where they have accelerated to higher speeds.</description>

      <title>Long-term investigation of an open cluster Berkeley 65</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a decade-long investigation of a poorly studied cluster, Berkeley 65 (Be 65), using deep optical data from the telescopes of ARIES, Nainital Observatory. We estimate its radius ($R_{cluster}$ = 1.6$^{'}$, aspect ratio of $\sim$1.1), distance (2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc) and age ($\sim$160 Myrs). A clear turn-off point at $\sim$1.7 M$_\odot$ in the mass function suggests the escape of low-mass stars, and the lower photometric mass compared to the dynamical mass indicates ongoing disruption due to external forces. Our long-baseline optical photometric data also identifies 64 periodic and 16 non-periodic stars in this region. We have presented the light curves and the classification of those variables. The periodic stars have periods ranging from $\sim$0.05 days to $\sim$3.00 days and amplitude ranges from $\sim$8 mmag to $\sim$700 mmag. The nonperiodic stars show variation from $\sim$30 mmag to $\sim$500 mmag. The periodic stars include main-sequence pulsating variables such as Slow Pulsating B-type, $\delta$ Scuti, RR Lyrae, and $\gamma$ Doradus. We report a detached binary system and rotating variables similar to BY Draconis-type stars exhibiting variable brightness caused by starspots, chromospheric activity, and magnetic field-related phenomena.</description>

      <title>Chromospheric velocities in an M3.2 flare using He I 1083.0 nm and Ca II 854.2 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chromospheric LOS velocities during the GOES M3.2 flare (SOL2013-05-17T08:43) using simultaneous spectroscopic data of the He I 1083.0 nm triplet and Ca II 854.2 nm line. A filament was present in the flaring area. The observational data were acquired with the VTT (Tenerife, Spain) and covered the pre-flare, flare, and post-flare phases. Spectroscopic inversion techniques (HAZEL and STiC) were applied individually to He I and Ca II lines to recover the atmospheric parameters. Different inversion configurations were tested for Ca II and two families of solutions were found to explain the red asymmetry of the profiles: a redshifted emission feature or a blueshifted absorption feature. These solutions could explain two different flare scenarios (condensation vs. evaporation). The ambiguity was solved by comparing these results to the He I inferred velocities. At the front of the flare ribbon, we observed a thin, short-lived blueshifted layer. This is seen in both spectral regions but is much more pronounced in He I, with velocities of up to -10 km/s. In addition, at the front we found the coexistence of multiple He I profiles within one pixel. The central part of the ribbon is dominated by He I and Ca II redshifted emission profiles. A flare-loop system, visible only in He I absorption and not in Ca II, becomes visible in the post-flare phase and shows strong downflows at the footpoints of up to 39 km/s. In the flare, the Ca II line represents lower heights compared to the quiet Sun, with peak sensitivity shifting from $\log \tau \simeq -5.2$ to $\log \tau \simeq -3.5$. The inferred LOS velocities support a cool-upflow scenario at the leading edge of the flare. The solar filament in the region remained stable. The inclusion of the He I triplet in the analysis helped resolve the ambiguity between two possible solutions for the plasma velocities detected in the Ca II line.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of oscillatory magnetic reconnection modulated by solar convective motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillatory magnetic reconnection is a periodic magnetic reconnection process, during which the current sheet's orientation and the magnetic connections change periodically. This periodic variation is generally considered to originate from the magnetic reconnection itself rather than from external driving processes. We conduct 2.5-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the emergence of a magnetic flux tube from the convection zone into the lower corona, where the emerging magnetic fields reconnect with background ones. During the reconnection process within 5771 s, the current sheet's orientation has been reversed 41 times, corresponding to 40 oscillation periods. Notably, the longest period is 30 minutes, which is consistent with the previous observational results. We find that the main factor leading to the reversal of the current sheet's orientation is the quasi-periodic external force provided by the emergence of plasma and magnetic fields from the convection zone. We also find the shifting of the upward outflows from the reconnection region along the horizontal direction due to the alternating changes of the reconnection inflow and outflow regions. In addition to the quasi-periodic change of the current sheet orientation, the reconnection rate at the main X-point also oscillates with a period between 100-400 s, which corresponds to the period of p-mode oscillations.</description>

      <title>Minimising the numerical viscosity in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique typically include numerical viscosity to model shocks and maintain particle order on the kernel scale. This numerical viscosity is composed of linear and quadratic terms, with coefficients $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ and $\beta_{\rm SPH}$ respectively. Setting these coefficients too high results in excessive numerical dissipation, whereas setting them too low may lead to unwanted effects such as particle penetration, which also leads to excess dissipation. In this study, we simulate accretion discs using the SPH code {\sc phantom} to investigate the effective disc viscosity arising from numerical viscosity. We model steady-state coplanar and circular discs with different values of $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ and $\beta_{\rm SPH}$, from which we determine the coefficients that lead to minimum levels of numerical viscosity by maximising the steady-state disc surface density for the same mass input rate. We find that, for planar and circular discs, the default values of the numerical viscosity parameters in the {\sc phantom} code can be too high particularly for the quadratic term. As higher values of the coefficients are required to adequately capture strong shocks in the flow, we suggest that the coefficient of the quadratic term should be time-dependent in a similar manner to the presently used ``switches'' on the linear term. This can be simply achieved by setting $\beta_{\rm SPH}$ to be a constant multiple of $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ with $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ determined by an appropriate switch, as previously advocated in the literature.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of erupting solar prominences using the Rolling Hough Transform: Toward a feature-oriented classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of solar prominences has proven to be challenging due to their diverse morphologies and dynamical behaviour. Complexity is heightened when considering eruptive prominences, where the dynamics demand methods capable of capturing detailed structural information. While there exists a range of line-of-sight (LOS) and plane-of-sky (POS) techniques which have advanced our understanding of prominence motions, they are subject to limitations, emphasising the need for effective methods of extracting structural information from prominence dynamics. We present a proof-ofconcept for the spatial Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) algorithm, which identifies finescale structural orientation in the POS, applied to prominence structure and dynamics. We demonstrate the RHT approach using two contrasting prominence dynamics events using SDO/AIA 304 \r{A} observations: (1) a quiet-Sun eruption, (2) activation (swirl) of a polar-crown prominence. By analysing the light curves and movies from each event, we divide the events into distinct dynamical phases: from slow rise to drainage. The spatial RHT method enables us to extract structural information and localised dynamics for both events and the different evolution phases. We develop a classification to label the prominences as either radially or tangentially oriented structures. The quiet-Sun eruption has a predominately tangential structure in the slow-rise phase, but displays greater radial features during/after the eruption. The polar-swirl activation initially shows a strong radial contribution, which diminishes as more tangential structures appear during/after the activation. Our results demonstrate the successful application of the spatial RHT to prominences, leading to the classification of individual prominences and an insight into their dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Samples and Binary Fractions of Red Supergiant in M31 and M33 by the HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binarity of red supergiants (RSGs) influences their evolution and the fate of supernovae. We investigate the binary fraction of RSGs in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and Triangulum Galaxy (M33) using photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which offers high spatial resolution to resolve more RSGs. A preliminary step involves identifying a reliable and complete RSG sample using the F110W $-$ F160W versus F160W diagram, yielding 2,612 RSGs from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey of M31 3,294 RSGs from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER) survey of M33. These samples suggest total RSG populations in M31 and M33 of 6,563 and 7,572, respectively. These estimates significantly exceed previous ones from the ground-based observations, an increase attributed to the superior spatial resolution of the HST. The stellar parameters of these RSGs, including effective temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$), radius ($R$), and luminosity ($L$), are derived by fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED) across optical and near-infrared bands. Binary candidates are identified by detecting ultraviolet (UV) excesses in their SEDs compared to the single-star RSG model prediction. The binary fraction is determined to be 33.4% $\pm$ 0.9% for M31 and 30.9% $\pm$ 0.8% for M33. For more luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} &gt; 4.0$, the binary fraction decreases to 31.6% $\pm$ 1.9% in M31 and increases to 34.7% $\pm$ 1.8% in M33, respectively. These results are in good agreement with predictions from the BPASS binary evolution model.</description>

      <title>Benchmark brown dwarfs -- I. A blue M2 + T5 wide binary and a probable young M4 + [T7 + T8] hierarchical triple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmark brown dwarfs in wide binary systems are crucial for characterizing substellar objects and calibrating atmospheric and evolutionary models. However, brown dwarf benchmarks with subsolar metallicity, very cool temperatures, or suitability for dynamical mass measurements are rare, limiting our understanding across the full range of mass, age, and metallicity. We present the discovery of two new multiple systems containing T dwarf companions, identified through a targeted search using CatWISE and Gaia databases. L 122-88 AB is a wide binary comprising a mildly metal-poor M2 dwarf and a T5 dwarf, separated by 215.6 arcsec at a distance of 33.106+/-0.014 pc. Atmospheric model fitting to the near infrared spectrum of L 122-88 A suggests a mildly metal-poor composition ([Fe/H] = -0.2). UPM J1040-3551 AB is a candidate hierarchical triple system at 25.283+/-0.013 pc, consisting of an M4 dwarf and a probable unresolved spectral binary of T7 and T8 dwarfs, separated by 65.48 arcsec from the primary. The H-alpha emission detected in UPM J1040-3551 A indicates an age range of 0.3-2.0 Gyr. This age estimate suggests that the T8 component has a mass between 9 and 28 Jupiter masses, potentially classifying it as a planetary-mass object. These systems augment the sample of benchmark brown dwarfs, particularly in the underexplored regime of cool temperature, providing valuable opportunities for refining our understanding of substellar objects.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Cold Worlds: A Near Complete Spectral Energy Distribution for 2MASS J04151954-0935066 using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the a near complete spectral energy distribution (SED) for an extrasolar world: the T8 brown dwarf 2MASS~J04151954$-$0935066. Spanning from optical to mid-infrared (0.7--20.4 micron) wavelengths, the SED for this substellar atmosphere is constructed from new JWST NIRSpec G395H ($R\sim$2700) and Magellan FIRE echelle ($R\sim$8000) near-infrared spectra, along with MIRI mid-infrared photometry complemented by spectra from Keck I, IRTF, Magellan, AKARI, Spitzer and photometry from various surveys and missions. The NIRSpec G395H spectrum reveals strong molecular absorptions from NH$_{3}$, CH$_{4}$, H$_{2}$S, CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O at approximately 3.00, 3.35, 3.95, 4.25, and 5.00 micron respectively, along with the presence of a CO absorption feature detected mainly at $\sim$ 4.6 micron. We detect no absorption of near-infrared K I doublets in the $R\sim8000$ FIRE spectra. In the mid-infrared IRS spectrum, we tentatively identify a new CO$_{2}$ feature at 14--16 micron. The comprehensive SED allows us to empirically constrain bolometric luminosity, effective temperature, mass and radius. Additionally, we demonstrate that the NIRSpec G395H resolution, the highest allowable by JWST, enables a precise radial velocity measurement of $47.1\pm1.8$ km s$^{-1}$ for the object, in agreement with previous measurements.</description>

      <title>CGCS 6306, another X-ray-emitting asymptotic giant branch star confirmed to be a symbiotic binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are known to exhibit UV excess and/or X-ray emission. These have been considered signposts of a hot white dwarf (WD) companion in a symbiotic system (SySt), but AGB stars are so bright that they easily outshine these companions hampering their detection at optical wavelengths. A recent multi-wavelength investigation on the X-ray-emitting AGB (X-AGB) star Y Gem has confirmed the presence of a WD companion and, thus, its SySt nature. Our goal is to explore the true nature of another X-AGB star, namely CGCS 6306, to investigate whether some objects from this group may in fact be unnoticed symbiotic systems with AGB donors. Optical spectra and photometric data, together with X-ray observations, have been analyzed to investigate the properties of the stellar components and accretion process in CGCS 6306. CGCS 6306 is a carbon Mira with a pulsation period of 362 days. Its optical spectrum exhibits the typical saw-shaped features of molecular absorptions in addition to H I and He I recombination and [O I] and [O III] forbidden emission lines. The H$\alpha$ line profile is broad, which can be interpreted as evidence for an accretion disk. The X-ray spectrum is hard, typical of highly-extincted hot plasma emission, and the X-ray luminosity is $\approx10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The detection of high-excitation optical emission lines and the X-ray properties of CGCS 6306 confirm the presence of a WD companion, making it a bona-fide $\delta$-type X-SySt. Its X-ray luminosity is comparable to that of Y Gem, the other X-AGB confirmed to be a SySt, which was found to exhibit a high accretion rate. The lack of suitable information on the UV and blue optical properties of CGCS 6306, however, precludes a definitive estimate of the accretion rate in this system. Since CGCS 6306 is a carbon Mira, it adds to the small group of Galactic carbon SySts.</description>

      <title>Very-wide-orbit planets from dynamical instabilities during the stellar birth cluster phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas giant planets have been detected on eccentric orbits several hundreds of astronomical units in size around other stars. It has been proposed that even the Sun hosts a wide-orbit planet of 5-10 Earth masses, often called Planet Nine, which influences the dynamics of distant Trans-Neptunian objects. However, the formation mechanism of such planets remains uncertain. Here we use numerical simulations to show that very wide-orbit planets are a natural byproduct of dynamical instabilities that occur in planetary systems while their host stars are still embedded in natal stellar clusters. A planet is first brought to an eccentric orbit with an apoastron of several hundred au by repeated gravitational scattering by other planets, then perturbations from nearby stellar flybys stabilise the orbit by decoupling the planet from the interaction with the inner system. In our Solar System, the two main events likely conducive to planetary scattering were the growth of Uranus and Neptune, and the giant planets instability. We estimate a 5-10% likelihood of creating a very wide-orbit planet if either happened while the Sun was still in its birth cluster, rising to 40% if both were. In our simulated exoplanetary systems, the trapping efficiency is 1-5\%. Our results imply that planets on wide, eccentric orbits occur at least $10^{-3}$ per star.</description>

      <title>A Criterion for Magnetars Producing Giant Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the straight flux rope in the model of giant flares on magnetars (Meng et al. 2014) was replaced with a curved one and the equilibrium behavior of the flux rope was investigated. Two footpoints of the flux rope are anchored to the spherical surface of magnetar. The forces acting on the flux rope include magnetic tension, magnetic pressure, curvature force, gravity. The equilibrium in the flux rope, so as in the global configuration, is achieved as these forces offset each other. Changes in the background environment drive the configuration to evolve through a set of equilibria in a quasi-static fashion until the critical point is reached and the loss of equilibrium in the configuration occurs, invoking a giant flare. We establish a criterion to identify magnetars capable of producing giant flares. Among the four forces, the curvature force as well as the magnetic compression tend to expel the flue rope outward. In a given magnetic configuration, the curvature force and magnetic compression are proportional to the square of the current intensity of the flux rope, which is determined by the frozen-flux condition and background magnetic field strength. We find that only when $\eta = G M m / ({{{R^4}{B_0}^2}})&lt; 0.48 $ is satisfied, the system reaches a critical point and potentially undergoes catastrophe. Here, $G, M, m, R$, and $B_{0}$ are the gravitational constant, the mass of neutron star, the mass of flux rope, the radius of neutron star, and the surface magnetic field strength of neutron star, respectively. The physical meaning of this criterion is that when $\eta \propto m / B_{0}^{2}$ is small enough, the curvature force and magnetic pressure can be sufficiently large to overcome gravitational confinement. This criterion establishes a basis for identifying magnetars capable of producing giant flares.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRISS Transmission Spectroscopy of the Super-Earth GJ 357b, a Favourable Target for Atmospheric Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a JWST NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of the super-Earth GJ 357 b: the first atmospheric observation of this exoplanet. Despite missing the first $\sim$40 % of the transit due to using an out-of-date ephemeris, we still recover a transmission spectrum that does not display any clear signs of atmospheric features. We perform a search for Gaussian-shaped absorption features within the data but find that this analysis yields comparable fits to the observations as a flat line. We compare the transmission spectrum to a grid of atmosphere models and reject, to 3-$\sigma$ confidence, atmospheres with metallicities $\lesssim$100$\times$ solar ($\sim$4 g/mol) with clouds at pressures down to 0.01 bar. We analyse how the retention of a secondary atmosphere on GJ 357 b may be possible due to its higher escape velocity compared to an Earth-sized planet and the exceptional inactivity of its host star relative to other M2.5V stars. The star's XUV luminosity decays below the threshold for rapid atmospheric escape early enough that the volcanic revival of an atmosphere of several bars of CO$_2$ is plausible, though subject to considerable uncertainty. Finally, we model the feasibility of detecting an atmosphere on GJ 357 b with MIRI/LRS, MIRI photometry, and NIRSpec/G395H. We find that, with two eclipses, it would be possible to detect features indicative of an atmosphere or surface. Further to this, with 3-4 transits, it would be possible to detect a 1 bar nitrogen-rich atmosphere with 1000 ppm of CO$_2$.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Infall and Accretion Shocks in the Outer Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-spatial-resolution observations of disks around young stars suggest planetary systems begin forming early, during the protostellar phase (&lt; 1 Myr) when stars accrete most of their mass via infall from the surrounding cloud. During this era shocks are expected to be ubiquitous around the gaseous accretion disk due to supersonic infall that strikes the disk. We investigate the role of shocks using a theoretical and modeling framework we call the shock twist-angle Keplerian (STAK) disk, connecting the disk and infalling envelope gas via a shock using general physical principles. Briefly, at the shock, energy is dissipated while angular momentum is conserved, so that the infalling gas must change direction sharply, yielding a bend or twist in the streamlines. The model's pre-shock gas follows free-fall parabolic trajectories, while the post-shock gas is on lower-energy, elliptical orbits.
  We construct synthetic observations and find that the deviations from circular Keplerian orbits are detectable in Doppler-shifted molecular spectral lines using radio interferometers such as ALMA. Specifically, the STAK model leads to line emission intensity and velocity-moment maps that are asymmetric and offset with respect to the disk structure traced by the dust continuum. We examine archival ALMA data for the class 0/I protostar L1527 and find the C$^{18}$O velocity moment map has features resembling the disk plus envelope emission that naturally arise when the two are connected by a shock. Thus, spectral line observations having sub-km/s spectral resolution and angular resolution sufficient to fully resolve the disk can reveal protostars' envelope-disk shocks.</description>

      <title>Identification of New Candidate Be/X-Ray Binary Systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud via Analysis of S-CUBED Source Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that a large population of Be/X-ray Binaries (BeXRBs) exists in the Milky Way's neighboring dwarf galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), due to a recent period of intense star formation. Since 2016, efforts have been made to monitor this population and identify new BeXRBs through the Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED). S-CUBED's weekly observation cadence has identified many new BeXRBs that exist within the SMC, but evidence suggests that more systems exist that have thusfar escaped detection. A major challenge in identifying new BeXRBs is their transient nature at high-energy wavelengths, which prevents them from being detected via their X-ray emission characteristics when not in outburst. In order to identify sources that may have been missed due to a long period of quiescence, it becomes necessary to devise methods of detection that rely on wavelengths at which BeXRBs are more persistent emitters. In this work, we attempt to use archival analysis of infrared, optical, and ultraviolet observations to identify new candidate BeXRBs that have been overlooked within the S-CUBED source catalog. Using X-ray/optical selection of source properties, unsupervised clustering, SED-fitting to VizieR archival measurements, and ultraviolet light curve analysis, we are able to identify six new candidate BeXRB systems that otherwise would have been missed by automated analysis pipelines. Using these results, we demonstrate the use of ultraviolet through near-infrared observational data in identifying candidate BeXRBs when they cannot be identified using their X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>pySTARBURST99: The Next Generation of STARBURST99</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: STARBURST99 is a population synthesis code tailored to predict the integrated properties or observational characteristics of star-forming galaxies. Here we present an update to STARBURST99 where we port the code to python, include new evolutionary tracks both rotating and non-rotating at a range of low metallicity environments. We complement these tracks with a corresponding grid of new synthetic SEDs. Additionally we include both evolutionary and spectral models of stars up to 300-500Msol. Synthesis models made with the python version of the code and new input stellar models are labelled pySTARBURST99. We make new predictions for many properties, such as ionising flux, SED, bolometric luminosity, wind power, hydrogen line equivalent widths and the UV beta-slope. These properties are all assessed over wider coverage in metallicity, mass and resolution than in previous versions of STARBURST99. A notable finding from these updates is an increase in H I ionising flux of 0.3 dex in the first 2Myr when increasing the upper mass limit from 120 to 300Msol. Changing metallicity has little impact on H I in the first 2Myr (range of 0.015 dex from Z = 0.02 to 0.0) but lower metallicities have higher H I by 1 dex (comparing Z = 0.02 to 0.0004) at later times, with Z = 0.0 having even higher H I at later times. Rotating models have significantly higher H I than their equivalent non-rotating models at any time after 2Myr. Similar trends are found for He I and He II, bolometric luminosity and wind momentum, with more complex relations found for hydrogen line equivalent widths and UV beta-slopes.</description>

Abstract: The number of known star clusters, associations, and moving groups in the vicinity of the Sun has increased significantly due to the use of Gaia data. We investigated the existence and properties of open superclusters (OSC) within 500 pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated HC8. Using advanced Gaia-derived astrometric data and star cluster catalogs, we identify and analyze member stars of various clusters, deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered cluster Duvia~1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of highly populated primordial groups and enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Astrometry-Only Detection of Microlensing Events with Gaia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrometric microlensing events occur when a massive object passes between a distant source and the observer, causing a shift of the light centroid. The precise astrometric measurements of the Gaia mission provide an unprecedented opportunity to detect and analyze these events, revealing properties of lensing objects such as their mass and distance. We develop and test the Gaia Astrometric Microlensing Events (GAME) Filter, a software tool to identify astrometric microlensing events and derive lensing object properties. We generated mock Gaia observations for different magnitudes, number of Gaia visits, and events extending beyond Gaia's observational run. We applied GAME Filter to these datasets and validated its performance. We also assessed the rate of false positives where binary astrometric systems are misidentified as microlensing events. GAME Filter successfully recovers microlensing parameters for strong events. Parameters are more difficult to recover for short events and those extending beyond Gaia's run, where only a fraction of the events is observed. The astrometric effect breaks the degeneracy in the microlensing parallax present in photometric microlensing. For fainter sources, the observed signal weakens, reducing recovered events and increasing parameter errors. However, even for Gaia G-band magnitude 19, parameters can be recovered for Einstein radii above two mas. Observing regions with varying numbers of Gaia visits has minimal impact on filter accuracy when the number of visits exceeds 90. Additionally, even if the peak of a microlensing event lies outside Gaia's run, microlensing parameters can still be recovered. GAME Filter characterizes lenses with astrometry-only data for lens masses from approximately 1 to 20 solar masses and distances up to 6 kpc.</description>

      <title>Modeling Polarized Radio Sounding Observations of a Coronal Mass Ejection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) evolve significantly as they propagate from the Sun to the Earth, so remote observations of their changes in speed, strength of the magnetic field, density, and overall structure are critical for predicting their arrival time and geoeffectiveness. Radio line-of-sight observations of Faraday rotation and Total Electron Content combined with white-light observations enables the measurement of these properties with careful analyses. This paper describes the analysis techniques and evaluates their accuracy with regard to measuring a CME's complex evolving structure and speed. The approach utilizes the layout of the Faraday effect tracker of coronal and heliospheric structures (FETCH), a purely space-based instrument concept, with Alfven Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM) simulations as input for evaluating these radio-based measures. Focusing on density and velocity/speed, we find that in-situ measurements of CME properties observe similar but different aspects of the distinct CME structure. The AWSoM model suggests that Faraday rotation may be a more sensitive measure of structure than Total Electron Content (TEC). Finally, we discuss the difficulty the simulation reveals in determining the trailing edge location of a magnetic flux rope.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Leiptr Stellar Stream: A Disrupted Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical abundances of stellar streams can be used to determine the nature of a stream's progenitor. Here we study the progenitor of the recently discovered Leiptr stellar stream, which was previously suggested to be a tidally disrupted halo globular cluster. We obtain high-resolution spectra of five red giant branch stars selected from the Gaia DR2 STREAMFINDER catalog with Magellan/MIKE. One star is a clear non-member. The remaining four stars display chemical abundances consistent with those of a low-mass dwarf galaxy: they have a low mean metallicity, $\langle{\rm[Fe/H]}\rangle = -2.2$; they do not all have identical metallicities; and they display low [$\alpha$/Fe] $\sim 0$ and [Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] $\sim -1$. This pattern of low $\alpha$ and neutron-capture element abundances is only found in intact dwarf galaxies with stellar mass $\lesssim 10^5 M_\odot$. Although more data are needed to be certain, Leiptr's chemistry is consistent with being the lowest-mass dwarf galaxy stream without a known intact progenitor, possibly in the mass range of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Leiptr thus preserves a record of one of the lowest-mass early accretion events into the Milky Way.</description>

Abstract: In July 2024, Sunrise completed its third successful science flight. The Sunrise III observatory had been upgraded significantly after the two previous successful flights in 2009 and 2013. Three completely new instruments focus on the small-scale physical processes and their complex interaction from the deepest observable layers in the photosphere up to chromospheric heights. Previously poorly explored spectral regions and lines are exploited to paint a three-dimensional picture of the solar atmosphere with unprecedented completeness and level of detail. The full polarimetric information is captured by all three instruments to reveal the interaction between the magnetic fields and the hydrodynamic processes. Two slit-based spectropolarimeters, the Sunrise UV Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) and the Sunrise Chromospheric Infrared spectro-Polarimeter (SCIP), focus on the near-ultraviolet and the near-infrared regions respectively, and the imaging spectropolarimeter Tunable Magnetograph (TuMag) simultaneously obtains maps of the full field-of-view of $46 \times 46$ Mm$^2$ in the photosphere and the chromosphere in the visible. The instruments are operated in an orchestrated mode, benefiting from a new Image Stabilization and Light Distribution unit (ISLiD), with the Correlating Wavefront Sensor (CWS) providing the autofocus control and an image stability with a root-mean-square value smaller than 0.005''. A new gondola was constructed to significantly improve the telescope pointing stability, required to achieve uninterrupted observations over many hours. Sunrise III was launched successfully on July 10, 2024, from the Esrange Space Center near Kiruna (Sweden). It reached the landing site between the Mackenzie River and the Great Bear Lake in Canada after a flight duration of 6.5 days. In this paper, we give an overview of the Sunrise III observatory and its instruments.</description>

      <title>The slowest spinning Galactic-field spider PSR J1932+2121: A history of inefficient mass transfer</title>

Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope is discovering hundreds of new pulsars, including a slowly spinning compact binary millisecond pulsar (spin period $P_{\rm spin}=14.2$\,ms) which showed radio eclipses and evidence of ablation of its companion: PSR J1932+2121. Its orbital period is $P_{\rm orb}=0.08$\,d and the minimum companion mass is estimated as 0.12\,\Msun. Hence, this pulsar is classified as part of the Galactic-field spider (redback) population. However, it spins almost an order of magnitude slower than other Galactic-field spiders. Using detailed evolutionary calculations with {\tt MESA}, we model the formation, mass-transfer and radio-pulsar phases, in order to explain the observed properties of PSR\,J1932+2121. We find that PSR\,J1932+2121 is a redback that has experienced an inefficient mass-transfer phase resulting in a lower accretion efficiency (in the range of 0.3 to 0.5) and subsequently slower spin compared to other spiders. We narrow down the initial range of $P_{\rm orb}$ that best reproduces its properties, to 2.0--2.6\,d. Current models of accretion-induced magnetic field decay are not able to explain its unusually high surface magnetic field of $2\times 10^{9}$\,G. Hence, PSR\,J1932+2121 provides a unique opportunity to study inefficient accretion-induced spin up and surface magnetic field decay of pulsars.</description>
