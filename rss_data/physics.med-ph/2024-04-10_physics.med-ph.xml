      <title>Ring Artifact and Non-Uniformity Correction Method for Improving XACT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray-induced acoustic computed tomography (XACT) as a novel imaging modality has shown great potential in applications ranging from biomedical imaging to nondestructive testing. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio and removing the artifacts are major challenges in XACT imaging. We introduce an efficient non-uniformity correction method for the ultrasound ring transducer.</description>

      <title>De-aberration for transcranial photoacoustic computed tomography through an adult human skull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noninvasive transcranial photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) of the human brain, despite its clinical potential, remains impeded by the acoustic distortion induced by the human skull. The distortion, which is attributed to the markedly different material properties of the skull relative to soft tissue, results in heavily aberrated PACT images -- a problem that has remained unsolved in the past two decades. Herein, we report the first successful experimental demonstration of the de-aberration of PACT images through an ex-vivo adult human skull using a homogeneous elastic model for the skull. Using only the geometry, position, and orientation of the skull, we accurately de-aberrate the PACT images of light-absorbing phantoms acquired through an ex-vivo human skull, in terms of the recovered phantom features, for different levels of phantom complexity and positions. Our work addresses the longstanding challenge of skull-induced aberrations in transcranial PACT and advances the field towards unlocking the full potential of transcranial human brain PACT.</description>

      <title>A statistical model to identify excess mortality in Italy in the period 2011-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excess mortality is defined as an increase in the number of deaths above what is expected based on historical trends, hereafter called baseline. In a previous paper, we introduced a statistical method that allows an unbiased and robust determination of the baseline to be used for the computation of excesses. A good determination of the baseline allows us to efficiently evaluate the excess of casualties that occurred in Italy in the last 12 years and in particular in the last 3 years due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. To this extent, we have analyzed the data on mortality in Italy in the period January 1st 2011 to December 31th 2022, provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). The dataset contains information on deaths for all possible causes, without specific reference to any particular one. The data exhibit strikingly evident periodicity in the number of deaths with pronounced maxima in the winter and minima in the summer, repeating itself in amplitude along the whole twelve-year sample. Superimposed on this wave-like structure are often present excesses of casualties, most likely due to occasional causes of death such as the flu epidemics (in winter) and heat waves (in summer). The very accurate periodicity along the seasons (the "baseline"), allows us to determine with great accuracy and confidence the number of expected deaths for each day of the year in the absence of occasional contributions. Each of the latter can be modeled with an additional function that parameterizes the deviation from the baseline.</description>

      <title>In-vivo imaging of the human thalamus: a comprehensive evaluation of structural magnetic resonance imaging approaches for thalamic nuclei differentiation at 7T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thalamus is a subcortical structure of central importance to brain function, which is organized in smaller nuclei with specialized roles. Despite significant functional and clinical relevance, locating and distinguishing the different thalamic nuclei in vivo, non-invasively, has proved challenging with conventional imaging techniques, such as T$_{1}$ and T$_{2}$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This key limitation has prompted extensive research efforts, and several new candidate MRI sequences for thalamic imaging have been proposed, especially at 7T. However, studies to date have mainly been centered on individual techniques, and often focused on subsets of specific nuclei. It is now critical to evaluate which options are best for which nuclei, and which are globally the most informative. This work addresses these questions through a comprehensive evaluation of thalamic structural imaging techniques in humans at 7T, including several variants of T$_{1}$, T$_{2}$, T$_{2}$* and magnetic susceptibility-based contrasts. All images were obtained from the same participants, to allow direct comparisons without anatomical variability confounds. The different contrasts were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed with dedicated approaches, referenced to well-established thalamic atlases. Overall, the analyses showed that quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and T$_{1}$-weighted MP2RAGE tuned to maximize gray-to-white matter contrast are currently the most valuable options. The two contrasts display unique, complementary features and, together, enable the distinction of the majority of known nuclei. Likewise, their combined information could provide a powerful input for automatic segmentation approaches. To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive assessment of structural MRI contrasts for thalamic imaging to date.</description>

      <title>Combining a ground-based UV network with satellite maps: A case study for Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A study for the comprehensive information of current UV exposure for the area of Germany, based on the method for near real time calculation of UV Index maps used in the framework of the Austrian UV Monitoring Network, is presented. For the area of Germany about 22.000 surface UV Index maps were calculated for the year 2022 via the radiative transfer model libRadtran by incorporating daily forecast data for ozone, albedo and aerosols from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service and taking into account cloud information gathered from SEVIRI data of Meteosat Second Generation in the form of a cloud modification factor. Ground-based measurements of 17 stations of the German Solar Monitoring Network were then compared to the modelled maps. For most stations the correlation coefficient between measured and modelled UV Index (UVI) is above 0.92 and the mean difference of modelled UVI to measured UVI is smaller than 0.5 UVI. The modelling of the UVI at the high mountain station Schneefernerhaus is associated with higher uncertainties (correlation coefficient 0.85 and mean UVI difference 0.6 UVI) due to the small-scale topography with spatially highly variable albedo and clouds. Moreover, case studies for specific locations with respect to cloud conditions and topography are discussed, as well as a case study of the combination of ground-based measurements and modelled UVI maps in form of spatial correction factors.</description>

      <title>Prior Frequency Guided Diffusion Model for Limited Angle (LA)-CBCT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in image-guided radiotherapy. Reconstructing CBCTs from limited-angle acquisitions (LA-CBCT) is highly desired for improved imaging efficiency, dose reduction, and better mechanical clearance. LA-CBCT reconstruction, however, suffers from severe under-sampling artifacts, making it a highly ill-posed inverse problem. Diffusion models can generate data/images by reversing a data-noising process through learned data distributions; and can be incorporated as a denoiser/regularizer in LA-CBCT reconstruction. In this study, we developed a diffusion model-based framework, prior frequency-guided diffusion model (PFGDM), for robust and structure-preserving LA-CBCT reconstruction. PFGDM uses a conditioned diffusion model as a regularizer for LA-CBCT reconstruction, and the condition is based on high-frequency information extracted from patient-specific prior CT scans which provides a strong anatomical prior for LA-CBCT reconstruction. Specifically, we developed two variants of PFGDM (PFGDM-A and PFGDM-B) with different conditioning schemes. PFGDM-A applies the high-frequency CT information condition until a pre-optimized iteration step, and drops it afterwards to enable both similar and differing CT/CBCT anatomies to be reconstructed. PFGDM-B, on the other hand, continuously applies the prior CT information condition in every reconstruction step, while with a decaying mechanism, to gradually phase out the reconstruction guidance from the prior CT scans. The two variants of PFGDM were tested and compared with current available LA-CBCT reconstruction solutions, via metrics including PSNR and SSIM. PFGDM outperformed all traditional and diffusion model-based methods. PFGDM reconstructs high-quality LA-CBCTs under very-limited gantry angles, allowing faster and more flexible CBCT scans with dose reductions.</description>
