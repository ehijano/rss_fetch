      <title>Online/Offline Learning to Enable Robust Beamforming: Limited Feedback Meets Deep Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust beamforming is a pivotal technique in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems as it mitigates interference among user equipment (UE). One current risk-neutral approach to robust beamforming is the stochastic weighted minimum mean square error method (WMMSE). However, this method necessitates statistical channel information, which is typically inaccessible, particularly in fifth-generation new radio frequency division duplex cellular systems with limited feedback. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a channel variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to simulate channel behaviors using limited feedback, eliminating the need for specific distribution assumptions present in existing methods. To seamlessly integrate model learning into practical wireless communication systems, this paper introduces two learning strategies to prepare the CVAE model for practical deployment. Firstly, motivated by the digital twin technology, we advocate employing a high-performance channel simulator to generate training data, enabling pretraining of the proposed CVAE while ensuring non-disruption to the practical wireless communication system. Moreover, we present an alternative online method for CVAE learning, where online training data is sourced based on channel estimations using Type II codebook. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, highlighting their exceptional performance in channel generation and robust beamforming applications.</description>

      <title>Protection of Guizhou Miao Batik Culture Based on Knowledge Graph and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the globalization trend, China's cultural heritage is in danger of gradually disappearing. The protection and inheritance of these precious cultural resources has become a critical task. This paper focuses on the Miao batik culture in Guizhou Province, China, and explores the application of knowledge graphs, natural language processing, and deep learning techniques in the promotion and protection of batik culture. We propose a dual-channel mechanism that integrates semantic and visual information, aiming to connect batik pattern features with cultural connotations. First, we use natural language processing techniques to automatically extract batik-related entities and relationships from the literature, and construct and visualize a structured batik pattern knowledge graph. Based on this knowledge graph, users can textually search and understand the images, meanings, taboos, and other cultural information of specific patterns. Second, for the batik pattern classification, we propose an improved ResNet34 model. By embedding average pooling and convolutional operations into the residual blocks and introducing long-range residual connections, the classification performance is enhanced. By inputting pattern images into this model, their subjects can be accurately identified, and then the underlying cultural connotations can be understood. Experimental results show that our model outperforms other mainstream models in evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving 99.0%, 99.0%, 98.9%, and 99.0%, respectively. This research provides new ideas for the digital protection of batik culture and demonstrates the great potential of artificial intelligence technology in cultural heritage protection.</description>

      <title>A recursive smoothing method for input and state estimation of vibrating structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recursive Bayesian filters have been widely deployed in structural system identification where output-only filters are of higher practicality. Unfortunately, the estimation obtained by instantaneous system inversion via filters can be compromised by an ill-conditionedness of the system, which is a consequence of the architecture of the sensor network. To significantly reduce the ill-conditioning and increase the robustness to available networks, a new recursive smoothing algorithm is proposed for simultaneous input and state estimation of linear systems. Unlike the existing minimum-variance unbiased (MVU) smoothing methods that are restricted to either systems with no direct feedthrough or systems with a full-rank feedforward matrix, the proposed smoothing algorithm is universally applicable to linear systems with and without direct feedthrough as well as those with a rank-deficient feedforward matrix. The proposed smoothing method does not assume any prior knowledge of the statistical characteristics or evolutionary model pertaining to the input. A different indexing of the discrete-time input leads to a distinct linear algebra from the existing MVU smoothing methods. An eight-storey shear frame and the Taipei 101 tower in Taiwan are used as case studies, and a thorough comparison is established with the Augmented Kalman Filter, MVU filters and MVU smoothing methods. It is shown that the incorporation of singular value truncation for system inversion can result in a noticeable improvement in the estimation. Moreover, across various sensor networks and in the presence of a rank-deficient feedforward matrix, the proposed method could achieve at least 67% noise reduction compared to other filters and at least 30% improvement compared to other smoothing methods.</description>

      <title>Statistical Estimation of Mean Lorentzian Line Width in Spectra by Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a statistical approach for estimating the mean line width in spectra comprising Lorentzian, Gaussian, or Voigt line shapes. Our approach uses Gaussian processes in two stages to jointly model a spectrum and its Fourier transform. We generate statistical samples for the mean line width by drawing realizations for the Fourier transform and its derivative using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In addition to being fully automated, our method enables well-calibrated uncertainty quantification of the mean line width estimate through Bayesian inference. We validate our method using a simulation study and apply it to an experimental Raman spectrum of $\beta$-carotene.</description>

      <title>Implicit Assimilation of Sparse In Situ Data for Dense &amp; Global Storm Surge Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hurricanes and coastal floods are among the most disastrous natural hazards. Both are intimately related to storm surges, as their causes and effects, respectively. However, the short-term forecasting of storm surges has proven challenging, especially when targeting previously unseen locations or sites without tidal gauges. Furthermore, recent work improved short and medium-term weather forecasting but the handling of raw unassimilated data remains non-trivial. In this paper, we tackle both challenges and demonstrate that neural networks can implicitly assimilate sparse in situ tide gauge data with coarse ocean state reanalysis in order to forecast storm surges. We curate a global dataset to learn and validate the dense prediction of storm surges, building on preceding efforts. Other than prior work limited to known gauges, our approach extends to ungauged sites, paving the way for global storm surge forecasting.</description>

      <title>The Still Secret Ballot: The Limited Privacy Cost of Transparent Election Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After an election, should officials release an electronic record of each ballot? The release of ballots could bolster the legitimacy of the result. But it may also facilitate vote revelation, where an analyst unravels the secret ballot by uniquely linking votes on an anonymous ballot to the voter's name and address in the public voter file. We first provide a theoretical model of how vote revelation could occur under various election-reporting regimes. Perhaps counterintuitively, releasing ballot records is no more revelatory than the typical practice of releasing aggregate vote tallies by precinct and method. We then present the first empirical evaluation of vote revelation, using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study. For 99.8% of voters, the release of ballot records led to no revelation of any vote choice. We conclude the ballot can be both public and still as secret as it is under typical reporting practices.</description>

      <title>ExIFFI and EIF+: Interpretability and Enhanced Generalizability to Extend the Extended Isolation Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly Detection involves identifying unusual behaviors within complex datasets and systems. While Machine Learning algorithms and Decision Support Systems (DSSs) offer effective solutions for this task, simply pinpointing anomalies may prove insufficient in real-world applications. Users require insights into the rationale behind these predictions to facilitate root cause analysis and foster trust in the model. However, the unsupervised nature of AD presents a challenge in developing interpretable tools. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing ExIFFI, a novel interpretability approach specifically designed to explain the predictions made by Extended Isolation Forest. ExIFFI leverages feature importance to provide explanations at both global and local levels. This work also introduces EIF+, an enhanced variant of Extended Isolation Forest, conceived to improve its generalization capabilities through a different splitting hyperplanes design strategy. A comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted, employing both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate various unsupervised AD approaches. The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of ExIFFI in providing explanations for AD predictions. Furthermore, the paper explores the utility of ExIFFI as a feature selection technique in unsupervised settings. Finally, this work contributes to the research community by providing open-source code, facilitating further investigation and reproducibility.</description>
