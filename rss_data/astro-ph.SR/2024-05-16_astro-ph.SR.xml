      <title>The impact of radiative levitation on mode excitation of main-sequence B-type pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical computations of stellar oscillations for models representative of B-type stars predict fewer modes to be excited than observations reveal from modern space-based photometric data. One shortcoming of state-of-the-art evolution models of B-type stars that may cause a lack of excited modes is the absence of microscopic diffusion in most such models. We investigate whether the inclusion of microscopic diffusion in stellar models of B-type stars, notably radiative levitation experienced by isotopes, leads to extra mode driving by the opacity mechanism compared to the case of models that do not include microscopic diffusion. We consider the case of slowly to moderately rotating stars and use non-rotating equilibrium models, while we account for (uniform) rotation in the computations of the pulsation frequencies. We calculate 1D stellar models with and without microscopic diffusion and examine the effect of radiative levitation on mode excitation, for both low-radial order pressure and gravity modes and for high-radial order gravity modes. We find systematically more modes to be excited for the stellar models including microscopic diffusion compared to those without it, in agreement with observational findings of pulsating B-type dwarfs. Furthermore, the models with microscopic diffusion predict that excited modes occur earlier on in the evolution compared to modes without it. In order to maintain realistic surface abundances during the main sequence, we include macroscopic envelope mixing by internal gravity waves. While radiative levitation has so far largely been neglected in stellar evolution computations of B-type stars for computational convenience, it impacts mode excitation predictions for stellar models of such stars. We conclude that the process of radiative levitation is able to reduce the discrepancy between predicted and observed excited pulsation modes in B-type stars.</description>

      <title>Chemically peculiar stars on the pre-main sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The chemically peculiar (CP) stars of the upper main sequence are defined by spectral peculiarities that indicate unusual elemental abundance patterns in the presence of diffusion in the calm, stellar atmospheres. Some of them have a stable local magnetic field of up to several kiloGauss. The pre-main-sequence evolution of these objects is still a mystery and contains many open questions. Aims. We identify CP stars on the pre-main sequence to determine possible mechanisms that lead to the occurrence of chemical peculiarities in the (very) early stages of stellar evolution. Methods. We identified likely pre-main-sequence stars by fitting the spectral energy distributions. The subsequent analysis using stellar spectra and photometric time series helped us to distinguish between CP and non-CP stars. Additionally, we compared our results to the literature to provide the best possible quality assessment. Results. Out of 45 candidates, about 70 % seem to be true CP stars or CP candidates. Furthermore, 9 sources appear to be CP stars on the pre-main sequence, and all are magnetic. We finally report a possible CP2 star that is also a pre-main-sequence star and was not previously in the literature. Conclusions. The evolution of the peculiarities seems to be related to the (strong) magnetic fields in these CP2 stars.</description>

      <title>Applications of Fast Magnetic Reconnection Models to the Atmospheres of the Sun and Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially-ionized plasmas consist of charged and neutral particles whose mutual collisions modify magnetic reconnection compared with the fully-ionized case. The collisions alter the rate and locations of the magnetic dissipation heating and the distribution of energies among the particles accelerated into the non-thermal tail. We examine the collisional regimes for the onset of fast reconnection in two environments: the partially-ionized layers of the solar atmosphere and the protoplanetary disks that are the birthplaces for planets around young stars. In both these environments, magnetic nulls readily develop into resistive current sheets in the regime where the charged and neutral particles are fully coupled by collisions, but the current sheets quickly break down under the ideal tearing instability. The current sheets collapse repeatedly, forming magnetic islands at successively smaller scales, till they enter a collisionally-decoupled regime where the magnetic energy is rapidly turned into heat and charged-particle kinetic energy. Small-scale, decoupled fast reconnection in the solar atmosphere may lead to preferential heating and energization of ions and electrons that escape into the corona. In protoplanetary disks such reconnection causes localized heating in the atmospheric layers that produce much of the infrared atomic and molecular line emission observed with the Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescopes.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XV: Influence of Magnetic Field Morphology in Dense Cores on Sizes of Protostellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field of a molecular cloud core may play a role in the formation of circumstellar disks in the core. We present magnetic field morphologies in protostellar cores of 16 targets in the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array large program "Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)", which resolved their disks with 7 au resolutions. The 0.1-pc scale magnetic field morphologies were inferred from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) POL-2 observations. The mean orientations and angular dispersions of the magnetic fields in the dense cores are measured and compared with the radii of the 1.3 mm continuum disks and the dynamically determined protostellar masses from the eDisk program. We observe a significant correlation between the disk radii and the stellar masses. We do not find any statistically significant dependence of the disk radii on the projected misalignment angles between the rotational axes of the disks and the magnetic fields in the dense cores, nor on the angular dispersions of the magnetic fields within these cores. However, when considering the projection effect, we cannot rule out a positive correlation between disk radii and misalignment angles in three-dimensional space. Our results suggest that the morphologies of magnetic fields in dense cores do not play a dominant role in the disk formation process. Instead, the sizes of protostellar disks may be more strongly affected by the amount of mass that has been accreted onto star+disk systems, and possibly other parameters, for example, magnetic field strength, core rotation, and magnetic diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Characterizing NGC 6383: A study of pre-main sequence stars, mass segregation, and age using Gaia DR3 and 2MASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs Bayesian analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze the young open cluster NGC 6383 using data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS. We identified 254 probable cluster members through HDBSCAN based on proper motions and determined the cluster's core and tidal radius. To perform this analysis, we utilized an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler, using the Bayesian library PyMC. Our results indicate a mean cluster age of $4 \pm 1$ Myr and a distance of $1.107 \pm 0.035$ kpc. The analysis reveals mass segregation, especially among binary stars, and suggests that NGC 6383 is not fully relaxed. We observed a well-defined main sequence and a population of pre-main sequence stars, with a star formation range from $\sim 1$ to $6$ Myr, indicating recent star formation activity.</description>

      <title>Low-Latitude Auroras: Insights from 23 April 2023 Solar Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In April 2023, low-latitude aurora observation by the all-sky camera at Hanle, Ladakh, India ($33^{\circ} {} N $ geographic latitude (GGLat)) was reported, which stimulated a lot of discussion among scientists as well as masses across the globe. The reported observation was intriguing as the solar storm that triggered this aurora was moderate and the first such observation from Indian region in the space-era. In this communication, we investigate such a unique modern-day observation of low-latitude auroral sighting occurring during the passage of sheath-region of Interplanetary-Coronal-Mass-Ejection, utilizing in situ multi-spacecraft particle measurements along with geomagnetic-field observations by ground and satellite-based magnetometers. Auroral observations at Hanle coincided with the intense substorm occurrences. It is unequivocally found that the aurora didnt reach India, rather the equatorward boundary of the aurora was beyond $ 50^{\circ} {}N $ GGLat. The multi-instrumental observations enabled us to estimate the altitude of the red auroral emissions accurately. The increased flux of low-energy electrons ($&lt;$100 eV) precipitating at $\sim 54^{\circ}N$ GGLat causing red-light emissions at higher altitudes ($\sim$700-950 km) can be visible from Hanle. The observed low-latitude red aurora from India resulted from two factors: emissions at higher altitudes in the auroral oval and a slight expansion of the auroral oval towards the equator. The precipitating low-energy particles responsible for red auroral emissions mostly originate from the plasma sheet. These particles precipitate due to wave-particle interactions enhanced by strong compression of the magnetosphere during high solar wind pressure. This study using multi-point observations holds immense importance in providing a better understanding of low-latitude auroras.</description>

      <title>The ratio of [Eu/$\alpha$] differentiates accreted/in-situ Milky Way stars across metallicities, as indicated by both field stars and globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine stellar orbits with the abundances of the heavy, $r$-process element europium and the light, $\alpha$-element, silicon to separate in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way across all metallicities. At high orbital energy, the accretion-dominated halo shows elevated values of [Eu/Si], while at lower energies, where many of the stars were born in-situ, the levels of [Eu/Si] are lower. These systematically different levels of [Eu/Si] in the MW and the accreted halo imply that the scatter in [Eu/$\alpha$] within a single galaxy is smaller than previously thought. At the lowest metallicities, we find that both accreted and in-situ populations trend down in [Eu/Si], consistent with enrichment via neutron star mergers. Through compiling a large dataset of abundances for 46 globular clusters (GCs), we show that differences in [Eu/Si] extend to populations of in-situ/accreted GCs. We interpret this consistency as evidence that in $r$-process elements, GCs trace the star formation history of their hosts, motivating their use as sub-Gyr timers of galactic evolution. Furthermore, fitting the trends in [Eu/Si] using a simple galactic chemical evolution model, we find that differences in [Eu/Si] between accreted and in-situ MW field stars cannot be explained through star formation efficiency alone. Finally, we show that the use of [Eu/Si] as a chemical tag between GCs and their host galaxies extends beyond the Local Group, to the halo of M31 - potentially offering the opportunity to do Galactic Archaeology in an external galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development and commissioning of a new Q-band receiver for the Nobeyama 45-m telescope, covering 30--50 GHz with a receiver noise temperature of about 15 K. We name it eQ (extended Q-band) receiver. The system noise temperatures for observations are measured to be $\sim$ 30 K at 33 GHz and $\sim$ 75 K at 45 GHz. The Half-Power-Beam-Width (HPBW) is around 38\arcsec at 43 GHz. To enhance the observation capability, we tested the smoothed bandpass calibration technique and demonstrated the observation time can be significantly reduced compared to the standard position switch technique. The wide-bandwidth capability of this receiver provides precise determination of rest frequencies for molecular transitions with an accuracy of a few kHz through simultaneous observations of multiple transitions. Particularly, we determined the rest frequency of SO ($J_N$ = $1_0$--$0_1$) to be 30.001542 GHz, along with the rest frequency of CCS ($J_N$ = $4_3$--$3_2$) being 45.379033 GHz, adopting CCS ($J_N$ = $3_2$--$2_1$) at 33.751370 GHz as a reference line. The SO profile shows a double peak shape at the Cyanopolyyne Peak (CP) position of the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1). The SO peaks coincide well with the CCS sub-components located near the outer parts of the TMC-1 filament. We interpret that the gravitational infall of TMC-1 generates shocks which enhance the SO abundance. The TMC-1 map shows that carbon-chain molecules are more abundant in the southern part of the filament, whereas SO is more abundant in the northern part. The eQ's excellent sensitivity allowed us to detect faint CO ($J$ = 1--0) spectra from the high-redshift object at a redshift of 2.442. Our receiver is expected to open new avenues for high-sensitivity molecular line observations in the Q-band.</description>

      <title>Giant branch planetary systems: Dynamical and radiative evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In seven billion years, the Sun will be dead. As stars like the Sun pass from their present state to that of a dead white dwarf star, they undergo two phases of extremely high luminosity and radius -- the red giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch -- during which they will lose half or more of their mass. These changes to the star have a significant impact on orbiting planets, asteroids and comets. The large stellar radius (beyond the current orbit of the Earth) leads to the engulfment of bodies entering the stellar envelope, a process enhanced by strong tidal interactions. The high luminosity affects bodies' orbits and physical properties, while mass loss can later trigger the destabilisation of bodies around white dwarfs. It is necessary to understand these processes to understand both the future of our Solar System, and to interpret growing observations of planetary systems around evolved stars.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Pan-STARRS and SMA observations of IRAS 23077+6707: A giant edge-on protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present resolved images of IRAS 23077+6707 ("Dracula's Chivito") in 1.3 mm/225 GHz thermal dust and CO gas emission with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and optical (0.5-$0.8\,\mu\mathrm{m}$) scattered light with the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS). The Pan-STARRS data show a bipolar distribution of optically scattering dust that is characteristic for disks observed at high inclinations. Its scattered light emission spans ${\sim}14''$, with two highly asymmetric filaments extending along the upper bounds of each nebula by ${\sim}9''$. The SMA data measure 1.3 mm continuum dust as well as $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O $J$=2$-$1 line emission over $12''$-$14''$ extents, with the gas presenting the typical morphology of a disk in Keplerian rotation, in both position-velocity space and in each CO line spectrum. IRAS 23077+6707 has no reported distance estimate, but if it is located in the Cepheus star-forming region (180-800 pc), it would have a radius spanning thousands of au. Taken together, we infer IRAS 23077+6707 to be a giant and gas-rich edge-on protoplanetary disk, which to our knowledge is the largest in extent so far discovered.</description>

      <title>Direct-imaging Discovery of a Substellar Companion Orbiting the Accelerating Variable Star, HIP 39017</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the direct-imaging discovery of a substellar companion (a massive planet or low-mass brown dwarf) to the young, $\gamma$ Doradus-type variable star, HIP 39017 (HD 65526). The companion's SCExAO/CHARIS JHK ($1.1-2.4\mu$m) spectrum and Keck/NIRC2 L$^{\prime}$ photometry indicate that it is an L/T transition object. A comparison of the JHK+L$^{\prime}$ spectrum to several atmospheric model grids finds a significantly better fit to cloudy models than cloudless models. Orbit modeling with relative astrometry and precision stellar astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia yields a semi-major axis of $23.8^{+8.7}_{-6.1}$ au, a dynamical companion mass of $30^{+31}_{-12}$~M$_J$, and a mass ratio of $\sim$1.9\%, properties most consistent with low-mass brown dwarfs. However, its mass estimated from luminosity models is a lower $\sim$13.8 $M_{\rm J}$ due to an estimated young age ($\lesssim$ 115 Myr); using a weighted posterior distribution informed by conservative mass constraints from luminosity evolutionary models yields a lower dynamical mass of $23.6_{-7.4}^{+9.1}$~M$_J$ and a mass ratio of $\sim$1.4\%. Analysis of the host star's multi-frequency $\gamma$ Dor-type pulsations, astrometric monitoring of HIP 39017b, and Gaia Data Release 4 astrometry of the star will clarify the system age and better constrain the mass and orbit of the companion. This discovery further reinforces the improved efficiency of targeted direct-imaging campaigns informed by long-baseline, precision stellar astrometry.</description>

      <title>On the formation of a $33\,M_{\odot}$ black hole in a low-metallicity binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $33\,M_\odot$ black hole (BH) was recently discovered in an 11.6-year binary only 590 pc from the Sun. The system, Gaia BH3, contains a $0.8\,M_\odot$ low-metallicity giant ($\rm [M/H]=-2.2$) that is a member of the ED-2 stellar stream. This paper investigates whether the system could have formed via isolated binary evolution. I construct evolutionary models for metal-poor massive stars with initial masses ranging from $35-55\,M_{\odot}$, which reach maximum radii of $1150-1800\,R_{\odot}$ as red supergiants. I then explore what combinations of initial orbit, mass loss, and natal kick can produce the period and eccentricity of Gaia BH3. Initial orbits wide enough to accommodate the BH progenitor as a red supergiant can match the observed period and eccentricity, but only if the BH formed with a significant natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\gtrsim 20\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$). These models are disfavored because such a kick would have ejected the binary from the ED-2 progenitor cluster. I conclude that Gaia BH3 likely formed through dynamical interactions, unless the BH progenitor did not expand to become a red supergiant. Only about 1 in 10,000 stars in the solar neighborhood have metallicities as low as Gaia BH3. This suggests that BH companions are dramatically over-represented at low-metallicity, though caveats related to small number statistics apply. The fact that the luminous star in Gaia BH3 has been a giant -- greatly boosting its detectability -- only for $\sim$1% of the time since the system's formation implies that additional massive BHs remain to be discovered with only moderately fainter companions. Both isolated and dynamically-formed BH binaries with orbits similar to Gaia BH3 are likely to be discovered in Gaia DR4.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Termination Region of the Parsec-Scale Jet of 3C 84 Over the Past 20 Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the kinematics of the parsec-scale jet in 3C 84 from 2003 November to 2022 June observed with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43 GHz. We find that the C3 component, a bright feature at the termination region of the jet component ejected from the core in 2003, has maintained a nearly constant apparent velocity of 0.259 +/- 0.003c over the period covered by observations. We observe the emergence of four new subcomponents from C3, each exhibiting apparent speeds higher than that of C3. Notably, the last two subcomponents exhibit apparent superluminal motion, with the fastest component showing an apparent speed of 1.22 +/- 0.14c. Our analysis suggests that a change in viewing angle alone cannot account for the fast apparent speeds of the new subcomponents, indicating that they are intrinsically faster than C3. We identify jet precession (or reorientation), a jet-cloud collision, and magnetic reconnection as possible physical mechanisms responsible for the ejection of the new subcomponents.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Properties of Molecular Gas Toward the Monoceros OB1 Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive CO study toward the Monoceros OB1 (Mon OB1) region based on the MWISP survey at an angular resolution of about $50''$. The high-sensitivity data, together with the high dynamic range, shows that molecular gas in the $\rm 8^{\circ}\times4^{\circ}$ region displays complicated hierarchical structures and various morphology (e.g., filamentary, cavity-like, shell-like, and other irregular structures). Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ data, a total of 263 $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures are identified in the whole region, and 88% of raw data flux is recovered. The dense gas with relatively high column density from the integrated CO emission is mainly concentrated in the region where multiple $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are overlapped. Combining the results of 32 large $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures with distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate an average distance of $\rm 729^{+45}_{-45}~pc$ for the GMC complex. The total mass of the GMC Complex traced by $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$, and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ are $1.1\times10^5~M_\odot$, $4.3\times10^4~M_\odot$, and $8.4\times10^3~M_\odot$, respectively. The dense gas fraction shows a clear difference between Mon OB1 GMC East (12.4%) and Mon OB1 GMC West (3.3%). Our results show that the dense gas environment is closely linked to the nearby star-forming regions. On the other hand, star-forming activities have a great influence on the physical properties of the surrounding molecular gas (e.g., greater velocity dispersion, higher temperatures, and more complex velocity structures, etc.). We also discuss the distribution/kinematics of molecular gas associated with nearby star-forming activities.</description>

      <title>Star-by-star dynamical evolution of the physical pair of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper using Gaia DR2 data, we demonstrated that the two closely situated open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 might have formed together about 50 Myr ago. In this work, we performed star-by-star dynamical modelling of the evolution of the open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 from their supposed initial state to their present-day state, reproducing observational distributions of members. Modelling of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 dynamical evolution was done using the high-order parallel N-body code \phi-GPU with up-to-date stellar evolution. Membership and characteristics of the clusters were acquired based on Gaia DR3 data. The comparison of the present-day radial cumulative star count obtained from the N-body simulations with the current observational data gave us full consistency of the model with observational data, especially in the central 8 pc, where 80% of the stars reside. The proper motion velocity components obtained from the N-body simulations of the stars are also quite consistent with the observed distributions and error bars. These results show that our numerical modelling is able to reproduce the open clusters' current complex 6D observed phase-space distributions with a high level of confidence. Thus, the model demonstrates that the hypothesis of a common origin of Collinder 135 and UBC 7 complies with present-day observational data.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, not included in the Solar system ephemeris, introduces correlated timing noise for pulsars with the magnitude and frequencies of the reported signal.</description>

      <title>Chemical inventory of the envelope of the Class I protostar L1551 IRS 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Episodic accretion in protostars leads to luminosity outbursts that end up heating their surroundings. This rise in temperature pushes the snow lines back, enabling the desorption of chemical species from dust grain surfaces, which may significantly alter the chemical history of the accreting envelope. However, a limited number of extensive chemical surveys of eruptive young stars have been performed thus far. In the present study, we carry out a large spectral survey of the binary Class I protostar L1551 IRS 5, known to be a FUor-like object, in the 3mm and 2mm bands with the IRAM-30m telescope. As a result, we detected more than 400 molecular lines. The source displays a great chemical richness with the detection of 75 species, including isotopologues. Among these species, there are 13 hydrocarbons, 25 N-bearing species, 30 O-bearing species, 15 S-bearing species, 12 deuterated molecules, and a total of 10 complex organic molecules (l-C4H2, CH3CCH, CH2DCCH, CH3CHO, CH3CN, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, CH3OH, CH2DOH, and HC5N). With the help of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE models, we determined the column densities of most molecules as well as excitation and kinetic temperatures. While most of those molecules trace the cold envelope (&lt; 20 K), the OCS and CH3OH emission arise from the warm (&gt; 100 K) innermost (&lt; 2'' ) regions. We compared the chemical inventory of L1551 IRS 5 and its column density ratios, including isotopic ratios, with other protostellar sources. A broad chemical diversity is seen among Class I objects. More observations with both single-dish telescopes and interferometers are needed to characterize the diversity in a larger sample of protostars, while more astrochemical models would help explain this diversity, in addition to the impact of luminosity outbursts on the chemistry of protostellar envelopes.</description>
