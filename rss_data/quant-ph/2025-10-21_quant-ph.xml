      <title>Experimental preparation of W states through many-body physics on a quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $W$ states are quantum correlated states possessing both bipartite and multipartite entanglement, which makes them useful for several quantum algorithms. We propose a protocol to generate these states by exploiting {\it topological ring frustration}, and implement it on a programmable Rydberg atom array up to 11 qubits, successfully generating many-body $W$ states of Rubidium atoms. Numerical simulations show promising scaling of the algorithm to tens of qubits with near-term achievable updates on the quantum machines. To validate our state preparation protocol and probe quantum entanglement, we devise a fidelity estimator that requires only two sets of measurements. To implement it, we develop a novel and efficient Bayesian state-tomography approach that takes advantage of accurate classical numerical simulations to overcome limitations in the experimental setup. Hence, a lower bound fidelity of around $77\%$ is certified for the experimentally prepared state of 11 qubits. This work provides a state-of-the-art procedure to generate high-quality quantum entangled $W$ states, demonstrating once more how principles of physics can overcome traditional barriers of computation, and be exploited for quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Full-stack Physics-level model of cascaded entanglement links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the last few decades have seen a proliferation of experimental demonstrations of entanglement sources, practicality of deployment has been a secondary concern. Recently, the ZALM source was introduced, as a well engineered functional device, easily integrated within a complete networking system. It addresses numerous concerns which make typical academic demonstrations less practical: reliable heralding signals, multiplexing across multiple dimensions, and efficient use of input power. We present a stack of tools for modeling mode by mode a ZALM source under realistic conditions, in isolation, or as a part of a complete network testbed. Our modeling formalism builds upon a hybrid Gaussian and non-Gaussian representation, providing a flexible tradeoff between performance and accuracy, while also greatly simplifying the exact calculation of otherwise expensive scalar figures of merit. This toolkit, implemented in the python package called genqo, is integrated within the QuantumSavory full stack simulator and the QuantumSymbolics computer algebra system. We use this software stack to demonstrate a number of complete networking protocols built upon the ZALM source.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian simulation of linearised Euler equations in complex geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises exponential improvements in solving large systems of partial differential equations (PDE), which forms a bottleneck in high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, in, among others, aerospace applications and weather forecasting. One approach is via mapping classical CFD problems to a quantum Hamiltonian evolution, for which recently an explicit quantum circuit construction has been shown in simple cases, allowing proof-of-concept execution on quantum processors. Here we extended this method to more complex and practically relevant cases. We first demonstrate how boundary conditions corresponding to arbitrary complex-shaped obstacles can be introduced in the quantum representations of elementary difference operators used to implement the PDE. We provide explicit and efficient circuit constructions, and show they neither increase the Trotter error, nor asymptotic gate complexity with respect to the free space equation. Using these methods we then derive quantum circuits for simulating the linearized Euler equations in a presence of a background fluid flow and obstacles. We illustrate our results by simulating the obtained quantum circuits for a number of boundary conditions, and compare the errors of the quantum solution to classical finite difference methods.</description>

      <title>Application Scale Quantum Circuit Compilation and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compilation and optimization of quantum circuits are critical components in the execution of algorithms on quantum computers. These components must successfully balance two competing priorities: minimizing the number of expensive resources, such as two-qubit gates or arbitrary angle single-qubit rotations, and minimizing the approximation error of the compiled circuit to the ideal target unitary describing the quantum algorithm. We develop a practical workflow for managing and optimizing this tradeoff, which enables quantum circuit compilation and optimization at scales of hundreds of qubits. Our workflow is able to tackle circuits at such large scales while providing rigorous guarantees on circuit output error by leveraging circuit partitioning and the notion of averaging over circuit ensembles. We demonstrate our workflow on several benchmark algorithmic circuits acting on up to 380 qubits, and show that it can simultaneously achieve substantial reductions in resource-intensive gates and control output errors, offering a practical and scalable strategy for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Approach to Atomic and Molecular Three-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-precision quantum computing simulations of three-body atoms (He, H$^-$) and molecules (H$_2^+$, HD$^+$), the latter being studied beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The Non-Iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled Cluster Variational Quantum Eigensolver (NI-DUCC-VQE) [M. Haidar et al., Quantum Sci. Technol. 10, 025031 (2025)] is used. By combining a first-quantized Hamiltonian with a Minimal Complete Pool (MCP) of Lie-algebraic excitations, we construct a compact ansatz with a gradient-independent construction, avoiding costly gradient evaluations and yielding efficient computational scaling with both basis size and electron number. It avoids barren plateaus and enables rapid convergence, achieving energy errors as low as 10$^{-11}$ a.u. with state fidelities only limited by arithmetic precision in only a few thousand function evaluations in all four systems. These results make three-body atoms and molecules excellent candidates for benchmarking and testing on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Further, our approach can be extended to more complex systems with larger basis sets, taking advantage of the efficient scaling of qubit requirements to study electronic correlations and non-adiabatic effects with high precision. We also demonstrate the applicability of NI-DUCC-VQE for simulating higher-order effects such as relativistic corrections and hyperfine interactions.</description>

      <title>Virus Spreading in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum communication have enabled long-distance secure information transfer through quantum channels, giving rise to quantum networks with unique physical and statistical properties. However, as in classical networks, the propagation of viruses in these systems could have severe consequences. Here, we investigate the critical problem of virus spreading in quantum networks. We develop quantitative tools, particularly a modified nonlinear dynamical system model, for performing epidemiological analyses on quantum networks. Our results show that quantum networks tend to be more resilient to viral infections, exhibiting higher epidemic thresholds than classical networks with identical graph topologies. This apparent robustness, however, arises primarily from the sparser connectivity inherent to the quantum networks. When the comparison is made at a fixed average connectivity, classical and quantum networks display comparable epidemic thresholds. These findings provide key insights into the security and reliability of future large-scale quantum communication systems. Our work bridges the fields of quantum information science, network theory, and epidemiology, paving the way for future studies of quantum epidemiological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Incomplete yet existent objects: a Nuclear Meinongian approach to quantum metaphysical indeterminacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a reading of quantum metaphysical indeterminacy from the perspective of Parsons' Nuclear Meinongianism. In doing so, we identify a fundamental incompatibility between a key feature of Parsons' theory and standard quantum mechanics. Our approach interprets quantum indeterminacy as property incompleteness. However, this move, when combined with Parsons' framework, leads to what we term the ``Incompleteness-Entails-Nonexistence Principle'' (IENP), which implausibly entails the nonexistence of quantum objects. For Meinongianism to be a suitable tool for the metaphysics of quantum mechanics, this principle must be addressed. We argue for dropping the IENP and discuss the resulting metaphysical and metametaphysical consequences.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Barrier Sequential Quadratic Programming for Nonlinear Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-assisted framework for solving constrained finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems using a barrier Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) approach. Within this framework, a quantum subroutine is incorporated to efficiently solve the Schur complement step using block-encoding and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) techniques. We formally analyze the time complexity and convergence behavior under the cumulative effect of quantum errors, establishing local input-to-state stability and convergence to a neighborhood of the stationary point, with explicit error bounds in terms of the barrier parameter and quantum solver accuracy. The proposed framework enables computational complexity to scale polylogarithmically with the system dimension demonstrating the potential of quantum algorithms to enhance classical optimization routines in nonlinear control applications.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for the Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite element method (FEM) is a cornerstone numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we present $\textbf{Qu-FEM}$, a fault-tolerant era quantum algorithm for the finite element method. In contrast to other quantum PDE solvers, Qu-FEM preserves the geometric flexibility of FEM by introducing two new primitives, the unit of interaction and the local-to-global indicator matrix, which enable the assembly of global finite element arrays with a constant-size linear combination of unitaries. We study the modified Poisson equation as an elliptic problem of interest, and provide explicit circuits for Qu-FEM in Cartesian domains. For problems with constant coefficients, our algorithm admits block-encodings of global arrays that require only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(d^2 p^2 n\right)$ Clifford+$T$ gates for $d$-dimensional, order-$p$ tensor product elements on grids with $2^n$ degrees of freedom in each dimension, where $n$ is the number of qubits representing the $N=2^n$ discrete grid points. For problems with spatially varying coefficients, we perform numerical integration directly on the quantum computer to assemble global arrays and force vectors. Dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced via the method of Lagrange multipliers, eliminating the need to modify the block-encodings that emerge from the assembly procedure. This work presents a framework for extending the geometric flexibility of quantum PDE solvers while preserving the possibility of a quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Chiral light from an emitter coupled to an achiral particle via the Purcell effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that non-chiral nanoparticles can produce chiral light when point emitters are coupled to their surface plasmon modes (SPMs) under certain conditions. Chiral emission arises from asymmetrical plasmon mode propagation from the source combined with the spin-momentum locked nature of the SPMs. The Purcell regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) ensures that radiation from the coupled mode dominates over that from the emitter itself, giving rise to photons with a circularly polarized component -- i.e. chiral light. We experimentally demonstrate this effect using electron beam-induced cathode luminescence from a gold nanorod, coupling it evanescently to a nanofiber probe which also supports spin-momentum locked light. This converts the net spin of the emission into a net directionality of propagation in the fiber modes.</description>

      <title>Burau representation, Squier's form, and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control over operation order built from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A,B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\rm fixed}^*$, yielding an explicit, analytic witness gap $\Delta(\omega)=p_{\rm switch}(\omega)-p_{\rm fixed}^*$. We prove that $\Delta(\omega)&gt;0$ is achievable, thereby certifying causal non-separability by purely algebraic means, and confirm this behaviour numerically. Conceptually, this furnishes a minimal non-Abelian $B_3$ control for a Gedankenexperiment in anyonic statistics.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal Prediction Error Estimation for Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the theoretical capabilities and limitations of quantum machine learning (QML) models to solve machine learning tasks is crucial to advancing both quantum software and hardware developments. Similarly to the classical setting, the performance of QML models can be significantly affected by the limited access to the underlying data set. Previous studies have focused on proving generalization error bounds for any QML models trained on a limited finite training set. We focus on the optimal QML models obtained by training them on a finite training set and establish a tight prediction error bound in terms of the number of trainable gates and the size of training sets. To achieve this, we derive covering number upper bounds and packing number lower bounds for the data re-uploading QML models and linear QML models, respectively, which may be of independent interest. We support our theoretical findings by numerically simulating the QML strategies for function approximation and quantum phase recognition.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of nonmonotonic quantum natural gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural gradient is an advanced optimization method based on information geometry, where the Fisher metric plays a crucial role.
  Its quantum counterpart, known as quantum natural gradient (QNG), employs the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) metric, one of the quantum Fisher metrics.
  While quantization in physics is typically well-defined via the canonical commutation relations, the quantization of information-theoretic quantities introduces inherent arbitrariness.
  To resolve this ambiguity, monotonicity has been used as a guiding principle for constructing geometries in physics, as it aligns with physical intuition.
  Recently, a variant of QNG, which we refer to as nonmonotonic QNG in this paper, was proposed by relaxing the monotonicity condition.
  It was shown to achieve faster convergence compared to conventional QNG.
  In this paper, we investigate the properties of nonmonotonic QNG.
  To ensure the paper is self-contained, we first demonstrate that the SLD metric is locally optimal under the monotonicity condition and that non-monotone quantum Fisher metrics can lead to faster convergence in QNG.
  Previous studies primarily relied on a specific type of quantum divergence and assumed that density operators are full-rank.
  Here, we explicitly consider an alternative quantum divergence and extend the analysis to non-full-rank cases.
  Additionally, we explore how geometries can be designed using Petz functions, given that quantum Fisher metrics are characterized through them.
  Finally, we present numerical simulations comparing different quantum Fisher metrics in the context of parameter estimation problems in quantum circuit learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rigorous analysis is presented for the entanglement spectrum of quantum many-body states possessing a higher-form group-representation symmetry generated by topological Wilson loops, which is generally non-invertible. A general framework based on elementary algebraic topology and category theory is developed to determine the block structure of reduced density matrices for arbitrary bipartite manifolds on which the states are defined. Within this framework, we scrutinize the impact of topology on the entanglement structure for low-dimensional manifolds, including especially the torus, the Klein bottle, and lens spaces. By further incorporating gauge invariance, we refine our framework to determine the entanglement structure for topological gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, in two dimensions, it is shown for the Kitaev quantum double model that not only the topological entanglement entropy can be reproduced, but also the Li-Haldane conjecture concerning the full entanglement spectrum holds exactly.</description>

      <title>Coherence-induced deep thermalization transition in random permutation quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a phase transition in the projected ensemble - the collection of post-measurement wavefunctions of a local subsystem obtained by measuring its complement. The transition emerges in systems undergoing random permutation dynamics, a type of quantum time evolution wherein computational basis states are shuffled without creating superpositions. It separates a phase exhibiting deep thermalization, where the projected ensemble is distributed over Hilbert space in a maximally entropic fashion (Haar-random), from a phase where it is minimally entropic ("classical bit-string ensemble"). Crucially, this deep thermalization transition is invisible to the subsystem's density matrix, which always exhibits thermalization to infinite-temperature across the phase diagram. Through a combination of analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we show that the transition is tuned by the total amount of coherence injected by the input state and the measurement basis, and is exhibited robustly across different microscopic models. Our findings represent a novel form of ergodicity-breaking universality in quantum many-body dynamics, characterized not by a failure of regular thermalization, but rather by a failure of deep thermalization.</description>

      <title>Parametric resonant enhancement of motional entanglement under optimal control: an analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically continuous-variable entanglement between the motional degrees of freedom of optically trapped massive particles coupled via the Coulomb interaction, in the presence of a feedback control scheme. We perform a detailed analysis of the parametric resonance induced by temporal modulation of the coupling strength, based on the system's coupled nonlinear, nonhomogeneous dynamical equations. Our model accurately reproduces the numerical findings and provides closed-form expressions for the entanglement degree. We demonstrate that a stationary nonequilibrium entangled state is realized as a result of the competition between parametric gain and decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum technology matures, the efficient benchmarking of quantum devices remains a key challenge. Although sample-efficient, information-theoretic benchmarking techniques have recently been proposed, there is still a gap in adapting these techniques to contemporary experiments. In this work, we re-formulate five of the most common randomized benchmarking techniques in the modern language of the gate-set shadow tomography. This reformulation brings along several concrete advantages over conventional formulations of randomized benchmarking. For standard and interleaved randomized benchmarking, we can reduce the required gate-set size and, using median-of-means estimators, also reduce the required experimental sample size. For simultaneous and correlated randomized benchmarking, we can additionally reconstruct the Pauli-terms of correlated noise channels using additional post-processing of only a single experimental dataset. We also present a minimal approach to extract leakage errors. Our work provides a clear avenue for comprehensive, reliable, and convenient benchmarking of quantum devices, with all methods formulated under a single umbrella technique that can be easily adapted to a range of experimental quantities and gate sets.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reversibility Meets Classical Reverse Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayes' rule connects forward and reverse processes in classical probability theory, and its quantum analogue has been discussed in terms of the Petz (transpose) map. For quantum dynamics governed by the Lindblad equation, the corresponding Petz map can also be written in Lindblad form. In classical stochastic systems, the analogue of the Lindblad equation is the Fokker-Planck equation, and applying Bayes' rule to it yields the reverse diffusion equation underlying modern diffusion-based generative models. Here we demonstrate that a semiclassical approximation of the Lindblad equation yields the Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner function -- a quasiprobability distribution defined on phase space as the Wigner transform of the density operator. Applying the same approximation to the Lindblad equation associated with the Petz map produces an equation that coincides with that obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation via Bayes' rule. This finding establishes a direct correspondence between the Petz map and Bayes' rule, unifying quantum reversibility with classical reverse diffusion.</description>

      <title>Grid-Partitioned MWIS Solving with Neutral Atom Quantum Computing for QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are prevalent in real-world applications, such as portfolio optimization, but pose significant computational challenges for large-scale instances. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages neutral atom quantum computing to address QUBO problems by mapping them to the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem on unit disk graphs. Our approach employs spatial grid partitioning to decompose the problem into manageable subgraphs, solves each subgraph using Analog Hamiltonian Simulation (AHS), and merges solutions greedily to approximate the global optimum. We evaluate the framework on a 50-asset portfolio optimization problem using historical S\&amp;P 500 data, benchmarking against classical simulated annealing. Results demonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the scalability and practical potential of our method in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. As neutral atom quantum hardware advances, our framework offers a promising path toward solving large-scale optimization problems efficiently.</description>

Abstract: Quantum repeaters are employed in quantum communication to overcome the long-distance transmission loss of quantum states. The quantum repeater is based on various key technologies, including quantum entanglement swapping, quantum memory, and entanglement purification. In particular, quantum purification can distil high-quality entanglement from the degraded entangled states which is propagating through noisy quantum communication channels. Although previous reports have demonstrated on-chip entanglement swapping and teleportation through the less-noisy channel, current entanglement purification experiments still rely on off-chip discrete devices, leading to limitations on scalability, stability, and controllability. In this paper, for the first time, we demonstrated chip-to-chip hyperentanglement distribution and quantum entanglement purification based on integrated silicon chips. Path-encoded high-dimensional entangled photon pairs are produced on the chip, converted to fibre-based polarization-spatial hyperentanglement by grating couplers, distributed to the receiver silicon chip, and finally purified by consuming the spatial degree of freedom. Our purification scheme by integrated photonics finished the last puzzle of on-chip quantum repeater, which will promote the realization of the quantum repeater based on integrated photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical and quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with Lie groups is hindered by the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of gauge degrees of freedom. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. X 15, 031065 (2025)], we introduced a new truncation scheme -- here renamed as Renormalized Dual Basis (RDB) -- based on the resolution of the single-plaquette problem, and demonstrated its performance for SU(2) LGTs. In this paper, we apply the RDB to compact quantum electrodynamics (cQED) in three spacetime dimensions (2+1D). We variationally determine the ground state of the theory for small lattices with periodic (for pure gauge) and open (in presence of fermionic matter) boundary conditions, achieving improved precision for the plaquette operator compared to previous approaches. By leveraging tensor networks, we extend the study to larger lattices and demonstrate the scalability of the method. Overall, we show that the RDB provides an efficient description across all coupling regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to solving the ground state of Fermi systems that contain spin or other discrete degrees of freedom in addition to continuous coordinates. The approach combines a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for energy estimation that we adapted to cover the extended configuration space with a transformer-based wavefunction to represent fermionic states. This sampling is necessary when the Hamiltonian contains explicit spin dependence and, for spin-independent Hamiltonians, we find that the inclusion of spin updates leads to faster convergence to an antiferromagnetic ground state. A transformer with both continuous position and discrete spin as inputs achieves universal approximation to spinful generalized orbitals. We validate the method on a range of two-dimensional material problems: a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, a noncollinear spin texture, and a quantum antiferromagnet in a honeycomb moir\'e potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary between classically simulable and computationally superior quantum systems is fundamental to identifying true quantum advantage. We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation on High-Connectivity Devices: A Resource-Efficient Approach toward Early FTQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a measurement-based FTQC (MB-FTQC) architecture for high-connectivity platforms such as trapped ions and neutral atoms. The key idea is to use verified logical ancillas combined with Knill's error-correcting teleportation, eliminating repeated syndrome measurements and simplifying decoding to logical Pauli corrections, thus keeping classical overhead low. To align with near-term device scales, we present two implementations benchmarked under circuit-level depolarizing noise: (i) a Steane-code version that uses analog $R_Z(\theta)$ rotations, akin to the STAR architecture [Akahoshi et al., PRX Quantum 5, 010337], aiming for the megaquop regime ($\sim 10^6$ $T$ gates) on devices with thousands of qubits; and (ii) a Golay-code version with higher-order zero-level magic-state distillation, targeting the gigaquop regime ($\sim 10^9$ $T$ gates) on devices with tens of thousands of qubits. At a physical error rate $p=10^{-4}$, the Steane path supports $5\times 10^{4}$ logical $R_Z(\theta)$ rotations, corresponding to $\sim 2.4\times 10^{6}$ $T$ gates and enabling megaquop-scale computation. With about $2{,}240$ physical qubits, it achieves $\log_{2}\mathrm{QV}=64$. The Golay path supports more than $2\times 10^{9}$ $T$ gates, enabling gigaquop-scale computation. These results suggest that our architecture can deliver practical large-scale quantum computation on near-term high-connectivity hardware without relying on resource-intensive surface codes or complex code concatenation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum mechanics provides a secure means of generating random numbers, with applications in fields spanning scientific simulation to cryptography. The first source-device-independent monolithically integrated quantum random number generator is reported. With a generation rate of 35 Gbit/s, the device is based on an InP photonic integrated circuit with a quantum vacuum state entropy source, sampled by heterodyne coherent detection using an optical local oscillator. The entire device is conveniently housed in a black box and includes all the necessary driving and signal conditioning electronics, with electrical interfaces only; the exhibited security, compactness, and fast generation rate make the generator suitable for applications in QKD.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has quickly emerged as a revolutionary paradigm that holds the potential for greatly enhanced computational capability and algorithmic efficiency, in a wide range of areas. Among the various hardware platforms, neutral atom quantum processors based on Rydberg interactions are gaining increasing interest because of their scalability, qubit-connection flexibility, and intrinsic appropriateness for solving combinatorial optimization challenges. This paper provides an overview of the present capabilities, standards, and applications of neutral atom quantum computers. We first discuss recent hardware advancements and register mapping optimization techniques that enhance circuit fidelity and performance. We next review their uses as quantum simulators, in both classical and quantum hard problems, such as MIS and QUBO problems, quantum many-body models and molecules in chemistry and pharmacology. Applications for enhancing machine learning are also covered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been significant recent advances in constructing theoretical and practical quantum error correcting codes that function well as quantum memories; however, performing fault-tolerant logical gates on these codes is less studied, and the protocols that do exist often require significant complexity. Building off the symplectic double construction, we investigate concatenated symplectic double codes, which have a rich set of logical gates implementable using only physical single-qubit gates and qubit relabeling. Combined with an injected logical phase gate, the full Clifford group on a single codeblock is achieved through a functionally simple circuit. We perform circuit-level simulations of state preparation and quantum error correction on these codes and show that they have promising performance at near state-of-the-art physical error rates. As such, we argue that concatenated symplectic double codes are strong contenders as the underlying computational code on medium- to large-scale quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For chaotic quantum dynamics modeled by random unitary circuits, we study the complexity of reduced density matrices of subsystems as a function of evolution time where the initial global state is a product state. The state complexity is defined as the minimum number of local quantum channels to generate a given state from a product state to a good approximation. In $1+1$d, we prove that the complexity of subsystems of length $\ell$ smaller than half grows linearly in time $T$ at least up to $T = \ell / 4$ but becomes zero after time $T = \ell /2$ in the limit of a large local dimension, while the complexity of the complementary subsystem of length larger than half grows linearly in time up to exponentially late times. Using holographic correspondence, we give some evidence that the state complexity of the smaller subsystem should actually grow linearly up to time $T = \ell/2$ and then abruptly decay to zero.</description>

Abstract: We investigate decoherence mechanisms in open quantum systems using quantum field theory techniques and the quantum Boltzmann equation. Specifically, we focus on decoherence through Bremsstrahlung emission, a fundamental process in quantum electrodynamics leading to coherence loss. By applying quantum field theory techniques and quantum Boltzmann equation, we model the fermion-photon interaction in the Stern-Gerlach interferometer and analyze the induced dephasing factor. Our approach offers significant advancements in understanding decoherence and its potential applications in quantum sensing and atomic interferometry. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method by comparing results to classical Bremsstrahlung.</description>

      <title>Surface code scaling on heavy-hex superconducting quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstrating subthreshold scaling of a surface-code quantum memory on hardware whose native connectivity does not match the code remains a central challenge. We address this on IBM heavy-hex superconducting processors by co-designing the code embedding and control: a depth-minimizing SWAP-based "fold-unfold" embedding that uses bridge ancillas, together with robust, gap-aware dynamical decoupling (DD). On Heron-generation devices we perform anisotropic scaling from a uniform distance 3 code to anisotropic distance (dx,dz) = (3,5) and (5,3) codes. We find that increasing dz (dx) improves the protection of Z-basis (X-basis) logical states across multiple quantum error correction cycles. Even if global subthreshold code scaling for arbitrary logical initial states is not yet achieved, we argue that it is within reach with minor hardware improvements. We show that DD plays a major role: it suppresses coherent ZZ crosstalk and non-Markovian dephasing that accumulate during idle gaps on heavy-hex layouts, and it eliminates spurious subthreshold claims that arise when scaled codes without DD are compared against smaller codes with DD. To quantify performance, we derive an entanglement fidelity metric that is computed directly from X- and Z-basis logical-error data and provides per-cycle, SPAM-aware bounds. The entanglement fidelity metric reveals that widely used single-parameter fits used to compute suppression factors can mischaracterize or obscure code performance when their assumptions are violated; we identify the strong assumptions of stationarity, unitality, and negligible logical SPAM required for those fits to be valid and show that they do not hold for our data. Our results establish a concrete path to robust tests of subthreshold surface-code scaling under biased, non-Markovian noise by integrating QEC with optimized DD on non-native architectures.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-Aware Quantum-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Continuous-Time Vehicle Control: A Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Lyapunov-Based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (LQRL) framework that integrates quantum policy optimization with Lyapunov stability analysis for continuous-time vehicle control. The proposed approach combines the representational power of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with a stability-aware policy gradient mechanism to ensure asymptotic convergence and safe decision-making under dynamic environments. The vehicle longitudinal control problem was formulated as a continuous-state reinforcement learning task, where the quantum policy network generates control actions subject to Lyapunov stability constraints. Simulation experiments were conducted in a closed-loop adaptive cruise control scenario using a quantum-inspired policy trained under stability feedback. The results demonstrate that the LQRL framework successfully embeds Lyapunov stability verification into quantum policy learning, enabling interpretable and stability-aware control performance. Although transient overshoot and Lyapunov divergence were observed under aggressive acceleration, the system maintained bounded state evolution, validating the feasibility of integrating safety guarantees within quantum reinforcement learning architectures. The proposed framework provides a foundational step toward provably safe quantum control in autonomous systems and hybrid quantum-classical optimization domains.</description>

      <title>Weight-dependent and weight-independent measures of quantum incompatibility in multiparameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparameter quantum estimation faces a fundamental challenge due to the inherent incompatibility of optimal measurements for different parameters, a direct consequence of quantum non-commutativity. This incompatibility is quantified by the gap between the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, which is not always attainable, and the asymptotically achievable Holevo bound. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of this gap by introducing and contrasting two scalar measures. The first is the weight-independent quantumness measure $R$, which captures the intrinsic incompatibility of the estimation model. The second is a tighter, weight-dependent measure $T[W]$ which explicitly incorporates the cost matrix $W$ assigning relative importance to different parameters. We establish a hierarchy of bounds based on these two measures and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for their saturation. Through analytical and numerical studies of tunable qubit and qutrit models with SU(2) unitary encoding, we demonstrate that the weight-dependent bound $C_{T}[W]$ often provides a significantly tighter approximation to the Holevo bound $C_{H}[W]$ than the $R$-dependent bound, especially in higher-dimensional systems. We also develop an approach based on $C_{T}[W]$ to compute the Holevo bound $C_{H}[W]$ analytically. Our results highlight the critical role of the weight matrix's structure in determining the precision limits of multiparameter quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Noise and Reservoir-induced Decoherence in Persistent Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent current is a hallmark of quantum phase coherence. We study the fate of the persistent current in a non-equilibrium setting, where a tight-binding ring is subjected to stochastic disorder as well as a fermionic reservoir attached to each site. We evaluate the current using Keldysh technique and find that it exhibits non-monotonic behavior, suggesting two distinct mechanisms of decoherence. While coupling to the reservoirs introduces a coherence length scale given by the inverse of the coupling strength, the other mechanism is more subtle and driven by the ratio of noise strength to reservoir coupling. The interplay of noise and reservoir constitutes a purely non-equilibrium steady state with a flatter distribution function that we effectively describe using classical rate equations. We discuss possibilities of realizing our findings in ultracold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>QINNs: Quantum-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical deep neural networks can learn rich multi-particle correlations in collider data, but their inductive biases are rarely anchored in physics structure. We propose quantum-informed neural networks (QINNs), a general framework that brings quantum information concepts and quantum observables into purely classical models. While the framework is broad, in this paper, we study one concrete realisation that encodes each particle as a qubit and uses the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) as a compact, basis-independent summary of particle correlations. Using jet tagging as a case study, QFIMs act as lightweight embeddings in graph neural networks, increasing model expressivity and plasticity. The QFIM reveals distinct patterns for QCD and hadronic top jets that align with physical expectations. Thus, QINNs offer a practical, interpretable, and scalable route to quantum-informed analyses, that is, tomography, of particle collisions, particularly by enhancing well-established deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum improved wormholes in the Dekel-Zhao dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents and investigates novel traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of Asymptotically Safe Gravity (ASG), sourced by a dark matter halo modeled by the Dekel--Zhao density profile. The scale-dependent gravitational coupling $G(k)$, derived from the ASG renormalization group flow in the infrared regime, is incorporated directly into the field equations, providing a consistent description of quantum gravitational corrections even at astrophysical scales. The combined effects of the running coupling (parameterized by $\xi$) and the dark matter characteristics determine the geometric structure and physical viability of the wormhole. The solutions satisfy the flare-out and asymptotic flatness conditions within restricted parameter domains, exhibiting enhanced curvature near the throat due to ASG corrections. Null Energy Conditions are necessarily violated at the throat, and stability analysis based on the adiabatic sound speed as well as the modified Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equation reveal that quantum effects from ASG counteract the destabilizing influence of dark matter. Phenomenologically, the wormhole shadow radius increases nearly linearly with $\xi$, lying within the Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A$^*$ when $\xi/M \simeq 0.8--0.9$, thus suggesting that ASG-corrected wormholes may represent observable signatures of quantum gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the multipartite entanglement structure of quantum states prepared by the Euclidean path integral over three-manifolds with multiple torus boundaries (the so-called link states) in both Abelian and non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories. For three-component link states in the Abelian theory, we derive an explicit formula for the R\'enyi multi-entropy in terms of linking numbers. We further show that the genuine multi-entropy faithfully quantifies the tripartite entanglement generated by GHZ-states, consistent with the fact that the prepared states are stabilizer states.</description>

      <title>KVASIR: A backscattering neutron spectrometer for hard condensed matter at ESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the instrument concept for KVASIR, a backscattering indirect time-of-flight neutron spectrometer for the European Spallation Source (ESS). KVASIR will probe low lying excitations of single crystal hard condensed matter that many advanced technologies rely upon. The instrument is simultaneously optimized for high resolution of energy-and momentum transfer, while ensuring perturbation by high magnetic fields. Detailed ray tracing simulations, considering the true geometry and aberrations of the analyser configuration have been performed. The proposed concept has room for polarisation analysis and extreme sample environments. Inelastic neutron scattering studies of single crystal hard condensed matter, with a particular focus on quantum, at yet unseen spatial and dynamic precision under extreme conditions are hereby enabled.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of cluster-based Haldane and bound-magnon states in a spin-1 Heisenberg diamond chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a spin-1 Heisenberg diamond chain in a magnetic field using a combination of analytical and numerical methods including the variational approach, exact diagonalization, density-matrix renormalization group, localized-magnon theory, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the unfrustrated regime, the model exhibits a quantum ferrimagnetic phase that captures key magnetic features of the nickel-based polymeric compound [Ni3(OH)2(C4H2O4)(H2O)4].2H2O such as a at minimum in the temperature dependence of the susceptibility times temperature product and an intermediate one-third magnetization plateau. In the frustrated regime, we uncover a rich variety of unconventional quantum phases including uniform and cluster-based Haldane states, fragmented monomer-dimer phase, and bound-magnon crystals. Analysis of the adiabatic temperature change and magnetic Gruneisen parameter reveals an enhanced magnetocaloric effect near field-induced transitions between these exotic quantum phases. Additionally, we demonstrate that the frustrated spin-1 diamond chain can operate as an efficient working medium of a quantum Stirling engine, which approaches near-optimal efficiency when driven into these unconventional quantum states.</description>

      <title>Large deviations in the many-body localization transition: The case of the random-field XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of rare system-wide resonances in the many-body localization (MBL) transition has recently attracted significant attention. They are expected to play a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the development of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their statistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field disordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission amplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply it to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, which formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the influence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators, we identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading in Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by rare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase where such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size phase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the Anderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based on real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even infinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite disorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction strengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space graph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral probes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes stems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and shorter-ranged deep in the localized phase.</description>

      <title>When Abstraction Breaks Physics: Rethinking Modular Design in Quantum Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstraction is a fundamental principle in classical software engineering, which enables modularity, reusability, and scalability. However, quantum programs adhere to fundamentally different semantics, such as unitarity, entanglement, the no-cloning theorem, and the destructive nature of measurement, which introduce challenges to the safe use of classical abstraction mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental conflict in quantum software engineering: abstraction practices that are syntactically valid may violate the physical constraints of quantum computation. We present three classes of failure cases where naive abstraction breaks quantum semantics and propose a set of design principles for physically sound abstraction mechanisms. We further propose research directions, including quantum-specific type systems, effect annotations, and contract-based module design. Our goal is to initiate a systematic rethinking of abstraction in quantum software engineering, based on quantum semantics and considering engineering scalability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the interpretation of the circular Unruh effect. To this aim, we rely on the principle of general covariance applied to the decay properties of non-inertial particles. Specifically, we show how the tree-level decay rate of an inverse-$\beta$ process involving scalar fields does not require the introduction of a thermal (or non-thermal) bath in the comoving frame to be a scalar under general coordinate transformations. Instead, we interpret any decay process as an emission of negative-energy quanta, whose existence is motivated by the absence of a global vacuum state for uniformly rotating observers. This implies that, in principle, no uniformly rotating particle can be regarded as stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries rigidly delimit the landscape of quantum matter. Recently uncovered spatially modulated symmetries, whose actions vary with position, enable excitations with restricted mobility, while Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) type anomalies impose sharp constraints on which lattice phases are realizable. In one dimensional a spin chain, gauging procedures have linked modulated symmetry to LSM type anomaly, but a general understanding beyond 1D remains incomplete. We show that spatially modulated symmetries and their associated dipole algebras naturally emerge from gauging ordinary symmetries in the presence of generalized LSM type anomalies. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and develop complementary field theoretic descriptions in arbitrary spatial dimensions that connect LSM anomaly inflow to higher-group symmetry structures governing the modulated symmetries. Our results provide a unified, nonperturbative framework that ties together LSM constraints and spatially modulated symmetries across dimensions.</description>

      <title>Sharp Transitions for Subsystem Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circuit complexity of time-evolved pure quantum states grows linearly in time for an exponentially long time. This behavior has been proven in certain models, is conjectured to hold for generic quantum many-body systems, and is believed to be dual to the long-time growth of black hole interiors in AdS/CFT. Achieving a similar understanding for mixed states remains an important problem. In this work, we study the circuit complexity of time-evolved subsystems of pure quantum states. We find that for greater-than-half subsystem sizes, the complexity grows linearly in time for an exponentially long time, similarly to that of the full state. However, for less-than-half subsystem sizes, the complexity rises and then falls, returning to low complexity as the subsystem equilibrates. Notably, the transition between these two regimes occurs sharply at half system size. We use holographic duality to map out this picture of subsystem complexity dynamics and rigorously prove the existence of the sharp transition in random quantum circuits. Furthermore, we use holography to predict features of complexity growth at finite temperature that lie beyond the reach of techniques based on random quantum circuits. In particular, at finite temperature, we argue for an additional sharp transition at a critical less-than-half subsystem size. Below this critical value, the subsystem complexity saturates nearly instantaneously rather than exhibiting a rise and fall. This novel phenomenon, as well as an analogous transition above half system size, provides a target for future studies based on rigorous methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spin-polarized muon implanted into a fluoride forms a coupled F--$\mu$--F complex in which the muon spin and neighbouring fluorine nuclear spins become entangled. Here we apply radio-frequency (RF) excitation to this coupled system and use the three-dimensional distribution of emitted positrons to reconstruct the time-dependent evolution of the muon spin polarization. This three-dimensional readout, using single spin detection, is not possible in a single NMR experiment and demonstrates significant advantages that are achieved by using RF muon techniques. We demonstrate the application of this vector-readout method to the experimental observation of a muon spin echo signal that is controlled by the dipolar coupling to fluorine, as well as to a double resonance experiment, in which we use pulses tuned to separate frequencies to address both the muon and fluorine spins. This targeted approach, in which selective RF pulses can control the muon spin and other spins to which it is coupled, provides a novel route for probing systems of entangled spins.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new scheme for quantum circuit design called controlled gate networks. Rather than trying to reduce the complexity of individual unitary operations, the new strategy is to toggle between all of the unitary operations needed with the fewest number of gates. We present the general theory of controlled gate networks and show that, under quite general conditions, it can significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates needed to produce linear combinations of unitary operators. The first example we consider is a variational subspace calculation for a two-qubit system. The second example is estimating the eigenvalues of a two-qubit Hamiltonian via the rodeo algorithm using operators that we call controlled reversal gates. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to realize the quantum circuits. The third example is the application of controlled gate networks to the controlled time evolution of a free nucleon on a three-dimensional lattice. For all of the examples, we show very substantial reductions in the number of two-qubit gates required. Our work demonstrates that controlled gate networks are a useful tool for reducing gate complexity in quantum algorithms for quantum many-body problems such as those relevant to nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing a Convolutional Autoencoder with a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Image Noise Reduction</title>

Abstract: Image denoising is essential for removing noise in images caused by electric device malfunctions or other factors during image acquisition. It ensures the preservation of image quality and accurate interpretation. Many convolutional autoencoder algorithms have proven effective in image denoising. Owing to their promising efficiency, quantum computers have gained popularity. This paper proposes a method, the quantum convolutional autoencoder (QCAE), which enhances traditional convolutional autoencoders by replacing their latent space with a quantum counterpart implemented via a QAOA-inspired ansatz circuit. To enhance efficiency, we leveraged the advantages of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)-incorporated parameter-shift rule to identify an optimized cost function, facilitating effective learning from data and gradient computation on an actual quantum computer. The proposed QCAE method outperformed its classical counterpart as it exhibited lower training loss and a higher structural similarity index (SSIM) value. QCAE also outperformed its classical counterpart in denoising the MNIST dataset by up to 40% in terms of SSIM value, confirming its enhanced capabilities in real-world applications. Evaluation of QAOA performance across different circuit configurations and layer variations showed that our technique outperformed other circuit designs by 25% on average.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of the syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on IBM quantum hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large scale quantum circuits are required to exploit the advantages of quantum computers. Despite significant advancements in quantum hardware, scalability remains a challenge, with errors accumulating as more qubits and gates are added. To overcome this limitation, quantum error-correction codes have been introduced. Although the success of quantum error correction codes has been demonstrated on superconducting quantum processors and neutral atom-based systems, there have been no experimental reports of error suppression using flag qubits on a quantum processor. IBM's quantum hardware features a non-topological coupling map, and past developments of quantum error correction codes on this platform have primarily explored the use of flag qubits. Here, we report the successful implementation of a syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on IBM quantum computers. Moreover, we demonstrate its effectiveness by considering the repetition code as a test code among the quantum error-correcting codes. Even though the data qubit is not adjacent to the syndrome qubit, logical error rates diminish as the distance of the repetition code increases from three to nine. Even when two flag qubits exist between the data and syndrome qubits, the logical error rates decrease as the distance increases similarly. This confirms the successful implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on the IBM quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Maximal Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt violation for qubit-qudit states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02092v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violation for a generic (typically mixed) qubit-qudit state, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This represents the optimal (2-2-2) Bell nonlocality for this kind of systems. The work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis result for a qubit-qubit setup. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation. We apply our general results to address a number of issues, namely, we obtain a bound on the degree of purity required in a system to exhibit nonlocality and study the statistics of nonlocality in random density matrices. In addition, we show the impossibility of improving the amount of CHSH violation by embedding the qudit in a Hilbert space of larger dimension. Finally, the general result is illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Complementarity-based complementarity: the choice of mutually unbiased observables shapes quantum uncertainty relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11395v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum uncertainty relations impose fundamental limits on the joint knowledge that can be acquired from complementary observables: perfect knowledge of a quantum state in one basis implies maximal indetermination in all other mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Uncertainty relations derived from joint properties of the MUBs are generally assumed to be uniform, irrespective of the specific observables chosen within a set. In this work, we demonstrate instead that the uncertainty relations can depend on the choice of observables. Through both experimental observation and numerical methods, we show that selecting different sets of three MUBs in a 5-dimensional quantum system results in distinct uncertainty bounds, i.e. in varying degrees of complementarity, in terms of both entropy and variance.</description>

      <title>Missing Puzzle Pieces in the Performance Landscape of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the maximum cut and maximum independent set problems on random regular graphs in the infinite-size limit, and calculate the energy densities achieved by QAOA for high degrees up to $d=100$. Such an analysis is possible because the reverse causal cones of the operators in the Hamiltonian are with high probability associated with tree subgraphs, for which efficient classical contraction schemes can be developed. We combine the QAOA analysis with state-of-the-art upper bounds on optimality for both problems. This yields novel and better bounds on the approximation ratios achieved by QAOA for large problem sizes. We show that the approximation ratios achieved by QAOA improve as the graph degree increases for the maximum cut problem. However, QAOA exhibits the opposite behavior for the maximum independent set problem, i.e. the achieved approximation ratios decrease when the degree of the problem is increased. This phenomenon is explainable by the overlap gap property for large $d$, which restricts local algorithms (like QAOA) from reaching near-optimal solutions with high probability. In addition, we use the QAOA parameters determined on the tree subgraphs for small graph instances, and in that way outperform classical algorithms like Goemans-Williamson for the maximum cut problem and minimal greedy for the maximum independent set problem. In this way we circumvent the parameter optimization problem and are able to compute the expected approximation ratios.</description>

      <title>Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In a monitored quantum circuit, regarded as a quantum channel, extensive and positive coherent information is sustained at low measurement rates, protected by the scrambling dynamics. However, noise suppresses coherent information, driving it to zero or negative values. Here, we show that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations facilitates reliable quantum information transmission even in the presence of noise, as evidenced by a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. We provide both analytical understanding and numerical evidence demonstrating this transition, which is modulated by the relative frequencies of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. Additionally, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition in experiments, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum circuit. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Error filtration is a hardware scheme that mitigates noise by exploiting auxiliary qubits and entangling gates. Although both signal and ancillas are subject to local noise, constructive interference(and in some cases post-selection) allows us to reduce the noise level in the signal qubit. Here we determine the optimal entangling unitary gates that make the qubits interfere most effectively,starting from a set of universal gates and proceeding by optimizing suitable functionals by gradient-descent or stochastic approximation. We examine how our optimized scheme behaves under imperfect implementation, where ancillary qubits may be noisy or subject to cross-talk. Even with these imperfections, we find that adding more ancillary qubits helps in protecting quantum information . We benchmark our approach against figures of merit that correspond to different applications, including entanglement fidelity, quantum Fisher information (for applications in quantum sensing),and CHSH value (for cryptographic applications), with one, two, and three ancillary qubits. With one and two ancillas we also provide analytical explicit expressions from an ansatz for the optimal unitary. We also compare our method with the recently introduced Superposed Quantum Error Mitigation (SQEM) scheme based on superposition of causal orders, and show that, for a wide range of noise strengths, our approach may outperform SQEM in terms of effectiveness and robustness.</description>

Abstract: One cannot justifiably presuppose the physical salience of structures derived via decoherence theory based upon an entirely uninterpreted use of the quantum formalism. Non-probabilistic accounts of the emergence of probability via decoherence are unconvincing. An alternative account of the emergence of probability involves the combination of a partially interpreted decoherence model and an averaging of observables with respect to a positive-definite quasi-probability function and neglect of terms $O(\hbar)$. Our analysis delimits the context in which the combination of decoherence and a semi-classical averaging allows us to recover a classical probability model within an emergent coarse-grained description.</description>

      <title>Protocols for Creating Anyons and Defects via Gauging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating and manipulating anyons and symmetry defects in topological phases, especially those with a non-Abelian character, constitutes a primitive for topological quantum computation. We provide a physical protocol for implementing the ribbon operators of non-Abelian anyons and symmetry defects. We utilize dualities, in particular the Kramers-Wannier or gauging map, which have previously been used to construct topologically ordered ground states by relating them to simpler states. In this work, ribbon operators are implemented by applying a gauging procedure to a lower-dimensional region of such states. This protocol uses sequential unitary circuits or, in certain cases, constant-depth adaptive circuits. We showcase this for anyons and defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ toric code and $S_3$ quantum double. The general applicability of our method is demonstrated by deriving unitary expressions for ribbon operators of various (twisted) quantum doubles.</description>

Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) is a simple yet rich model of strongly interacting electrons with complex dynamics and a variety of emerging quantum phases. These properties make it a compelling target for digital quantum simulation. Trotterization-based quantum simulations have shown promise, but implementations on current hardware are limited by noise, necessitating error mitigation techniques like circuit optimization and post-selection. A mapping of the FHM to a Z2 LGT was recently proposed that restricts the dynamics to a subspace protected by additional symmetries, and its ability for post-selection error mitigation was verified through noisy classical simulations. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a suite of algorithm-hardware co-design strategies on a trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting two key aspects of NISQ-era quantum simulation: circuit compilation and error mitigation. In particular, a novel combination of iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) and subsystem von Neumann Entropy compression reduces the 2-qubit gate count of FHM quantum simulation by 35%, consequently doubling the number of simulatable Trotter steps when used in tandem with error mitigation based on conserved symmetries, debiasing and sharpening techniques. Our work demonstrates the value of algorithm-hardware co-design to operate digital quantum simulators at the threshold of maximum circuit depths allowed by current hardware, and is broadly generalizable to strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry and materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13839v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) that define a subspace in which to diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here, we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Systematic analysis when increasing the number of qubits in a hydrogen chain shows that the subspace size required for sufficiently accurate results is reasonable at system sizes that cannot be solved by naive classical diagonalization. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers in quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to distribute heralded entanglement between distant matter nodes is a primitive for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. Some of the most crucial requirements for future applications include high heralding rates at telecom wavelengths, multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval of stored excitations for synchronization of separate quantum links. Despite tremendous progress in various physical systems, the demonstration of telecom-heralded entanglement between quantum nodes featuring both multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval remains elusive. In this work, we combine narrowband parametric photon-pair sources and solid-state quantum memories based on rare-earth doped crystals to demonstrate telecom heralded entanglement between spatially separated spin-wave quantum memories with fully adjustable recall time and temporal multiplexing of 15 modes. In a first experiment, the storage in the spin-state is conditioned on the entanglement heralding. We take advantage of the control over readout pulse phase to achieve feed-forward conditional phase-shifts on the stored photons depending on which heralding detector clicked. We exploit this effect to double the entanglement heralding rate for a given quantum state up to 510 cps, with an associated detection rate of 0.32 cps and measured positive concurrence by up to 6 standard deviations. In a second experiment, we simulate the communication time of a long-distance link by implementing an unconditional storage scheme with a dead-time of 100 $\mu$s. We take advantage of temporal multiplexing to increase the entanglement rates by a factor of 15 with respect to single mode storage, reaching a value of 22 cps per heralding detector. These results establish our architecture as a prime candidate for the implementation of scalable high-rate quantum network links.</description>

      <title>Parent Lindbladians for Matrix Product Density Operators</title>

Abstract: Understanding quantum phases of matter is a fundamental goal in physics. For pure states, the representatives of phases are the ground states of locally interacting Hamiltonians, which are also renormalization fixed points (RFPs). These RFP states are exactly described by tensor networks. Extending this framework to mixed states, matrix product density operators (MPDOs) which are RFPs are believed to encapsulate mixed-state phases of matter in one dimension, where non-trivial topological phases have already been shown to exist. However, to better motivate the physical relevance of those states, and in particular the physical relevance of the recently found non-trivial phases, it remains an open question whether such MPDO RFPs can be realized as steady states of local Lindbladians. In this work, we resolve this question by analytically constructing parent Lindbladians for MPDO RFPs. These Lindbladians are local, frustration-free, and exhibit minimal steady-state degeneracy. Interestingly, we find that parent Lindbladians possess a rich structure that distinguishes them from their Hamiltonian counterparts. In particular, we uncover an intriguing connection between the non-commutativity of the Lindbladian terms and the fact that the corresponding MPDO RFP belongs to a non-trivial phase.</description>

      <title>Antiscarring from eigenstate stacking in a chaotic spinor condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a feature of quantum scarring in systems with many particles: Quantum scars, living densely near an unstable periodic orbit, must be compensated by corresponding antiscarred states suppressed there to establish the uniformity of the whole. The uniformity of the underlying phase space is linked to early-time dynamics -- a regime beyond the predictions of random matrix theory and encapsulated in the eigenstate stacking theorem. By extending the domain of the stacking theorem, we apply our theory to a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics have recently been observed in the laboratory. Our work uncovers how scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.</description>

      <title>Generic Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Kogut--Susskind Lattice Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies the understanding of mechanisms that avoid quantum thermalization in an isolated system quenched far from equilibrium. A prominent example is Hilbert space fragmentation, which has recently emerged as an ergodicity-breaking mechanism in constrained spin models. Here, we show that Kogut--Susskind formulations of lattice gauge theories in $d+1$D ($d$ spatial and one temporal dimensions) give rise to Hilbert space fragmentation, and discuss possible implications for understanding continuum physics. Our findings not only prove that lattice gauge theories are a natural platform for Hilbert space fragmentation, they also serve as a guide to the conditions under which these models can be faithfully used to infer the thermalization properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production rate of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry remains largely unexplored. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. In particular, we show that, while the cumulative AFL entropy generally saturates to the dimensional bound at late times for chaotic dynamics, this saturation value is distinctively lower when the measurements respect the symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the crucial role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is readily adaptable for investigating symmetry's influence across diverse probes of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Classical-Quantum Newtonian Gravity with stable vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Gravitational Poissonian Spontaneous Localization (GPSL) model, a hybrid classical-quantum model in which classical Newtonian gravity emerges from stochastic collapses of the mass density operator, and consistently couples to quantum matter. Unlike models based on continuous weak measurement schemes, we show that GPSL ensures vacuum stability; this, together with its applicability to identical particles and fields, makes it a promising candidate for a relativistic generalization. We analyze the model's general properties, and compare its predictions with those based on continuous weak measurement schemes. Notably, here the gravitational feedback enters entirely through the non-Hermitian jump operators, without modifying the unitary part of the dynamics. We show that this leads to a short-range gravitational back-reaction and permits decoherence rates below those of any model based on continuous weak measurement schemes. We provide explicit examples, including the dynamics of a single particle and a rigid sphere, to illustrate the distinctive phenomenology of the model. Finally, we discuss the experimental testability of GPSL, highlighting both interferometric and non-interferometric strategies to constrain its parameters and distinguish it from competing models.</description>

      <title>Energy shortcut of quantum protocols by optimal control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an energetically-optimal method inspired from Shortcut-To-Adiabaticity (STA) processes, named Quantum-Optimal-Shortcut-To-Energetics (QOSTE). QOSTE produces the same transformation as STA for a given protocol used in quantum technologies or thermodynamics, but at the lowest possible energy cost. We apply optimal control theory to analytically design the QOSTE controls for a qubit and show that the minimal energy cost is determined by the length of the geodesic in the rotating frame given by the original protocol. A numerical example in the case of a two-level quantum system under the Landau-Zener protocol illustrates the method. We observe a dramatic reduction in energy with respect to standard STA methods. Finally, using gradient-based optimization algorithms and highlighting the emerging trade-off between robustness and energy cost, we design robust QOSTE outperforming STA both in robustness and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Basic entanglement distillation with realistic noise</title>

Abstract: Entanglement distillation is a key component of modular quantum computing and long-range quantum communications. However, this powerful tool to reduce noise in entangled states is difficult to realize in practice for two main reasons. First, operations used to carry out distillation inject noise they seek to remove. Second, the extent to which distillation can work under realistic device noise is less well studied. In this work, we both simulate distillation using a variety of device noise models and perform distillation experiments on fixed-frequency IBM devices. We find reasonable agreement between experimental data and simulation done using Pauli and non-Pauli noise models. In our data, we find broad improvement when the metric of success for distillation is to improve average Bell fidelity under effective global depolarizing noise, remove coherent errors, or improve the Bell fidelity of mildly degraded Bell pairs. We pave the way to obtain broad improvement from distillation under a stricter, but practically relevant, metric: distill (physically) nonlocal Bell pairs with higher fidelity than possible to obtain with other available methods. Our results also help understand metrics and requirements for quantum devices to use entanglement distillation as a primitive for modular computing.</description>

      <title>Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based quantum resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11331v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. While state-based resource theories have been extensively studied, their measurement-based resource theories remain relatively underexplored. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. In this work, we investigate the quantification of measurement-based resources using distance-based measures, followed by a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of \epsilon-measures. We also extend our analysis by exploring the connections between \epsilon-measures and some key quantities relevant to resource manipulation tasks. Importantly, the analysis of resources based on sets of measurements are tedious compared to that of single measurements as the former allows more general transformations such as controlled implementation. Yet our framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. In short, our analysis is applicable to existing resource theories of measurements and has the potential to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.</description>

      <title>Iterative Quantum Feature Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation, which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, the IQFMs framework effectively reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that the IQFMs framework outperforms quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs framework achieves performance comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning.</description>

      <title>Electric-field Quantum Sensing Exploiting a Photogenerated Charge-transfer Triplet State in a Molecular Semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising platforms for quantum sensing due to their chemically tunable Hamiltonians, enabling tailored coherence properties and interactions with external fields. However, electric field sensing remains challenging owing to typically weak spin-electric coupling (SEC) and limited directional sensitivity. Addressing these issues using heavy atoms exhibiting strong atomic spin-orbit couplings (SOC) often compromises spin coherence times. Here, we demonstrate coherent electric field sensing using a photogenerated charge-transfer (CT) spin triplet state in the organic molecule ACRSA (10-phenyl-10H,10' H-spiro\[acridine-9,9'-anthracen]-10'-one). By embedding electric field pulses within a Hahn echo sequence, we coherently manipulate the spin triplet and extract both the magnitude and directional dependence of its SEC. The measured SEC strength is approximately 0.51 Hz/(V/m), comparable to values reported in systems with strong atomic SOC, illustrating that heavy atoms are not a prerequisite for electric-field sensitivity of spin states. Our findings position organic CT triplets as chemically versatile and directionally sensitive quantum sensors of E-fields that function without atomic-SOC-mediated mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate background-free, hyperfine-level-selective measurements of individual Cs atoms by simultaneous cooling to $5.3~\mu\rm K$ and imaging on the $6s_{1/2}\rightarrow 5d_{5/2}$ electric-quadrupole transition. We achieve hyperfine resolved detection with fidelity 0.9993(4) and atom retention of 0.9954(5), limited primarily by vacuum lifetime. Performing state measurements in a 3D cooling configuration enables repeated low loss measurements. A theoretical analysis of an extension of the demonstrated approach based on quenching of the excited state with an auxiliary field, identifies parameters for hyperfine-resolved measurements with a projected fidelity of $\sim 0.9995 $ in $\sim 60~\mu\rm s$.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum superresolution for full distance between incoherent optical sources in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rayleigh criterion has long served as a fundamental limit for the resolution of optical imag- ing. Recent advances in multiparameter quantum metrology have led to quantum superresolution that can break this limit and achieve nonvanishing precision in estimating the separation between a pair of closely located incoherent point sources. For two-dimensional optical systems, the quantum superresolution has been studied for the Cartesian components of separation between two incoherent point sources. However, the precision limit of estimating the full distance between two point sources remains unknown so far. In this paper, we investigate the estimation precision of the full distance between two incoherent point sources with arbitrary intensities in a two-dimensional imaging sys- tem. Through the multiparameter quantum estimation theory, we obtain the ultimate estimation precision for the distance and show that it remains nonzero when the distance approaches zero, which surpasses the Rayleigh criterion. We further show the dependence of the estimation precision on the relative orientation between the two point sources, which leads to a novel scheme that can enhance the precision by aligning the sources along proper directions if the point-spread functions are not circularly symmetric, and the enhancement is determined by the extent to which the point- spread functions deviate from circular symmetry. Finally, the results are illustrated by incoherent sources with Gaussian point-spread functions.</description>

      <title>Multimode rotationally symmetric bosonic codes from group-theoretic construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of multi-mode, rotationally symmetric bosonic codes inspired by the group-theoretic framework of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240603 (2024)]. Such a construction inverts the traditional paradigm of code design by identifying codes from the requirement that a group of chosen logical gates should be implemented by means of physically simple logical operations, such as linear optics. Leveraging previously unexplored degrees of freedom within this framework, our construction preserves rotational symmetry across multiple modes, enabling linear-optics implementation of the full Pauli group. These codes exhibit improved protection against dephasing noise, outperforming both single-mode analogues and earlier multi-mode constructions. Notably, they allow exact correction of correlated dephasing and support qudit encoding in arbitrary dimensions. We analytically construct and numerically benchmark two-mode binomial codes instances, and demonstrate that, unlike single-mode rotationally symmetric bosonic codes, these exhibit no trade-off between protection against dephasing and photon loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct measurement of quantum non-Gaussianity requires some variant of a discrete photon-resolving detection, which is feasible only for low mean photon numbers. For a large mean photon number, intensity detection by linear photodiodes provides a continuous signal; therefore, the Fock probabilities of the unknown input state are not directly available. On the other hand, intensity moments can be measured directly, and photon-number moments can be estimated. Therefore, we derive and analyze a quantum non-Gaussianity witness based solely on the photon number mean and variance (or alternatively, the second-order correlation $g^{(2)}$) of an unknown state. Due to the simplicity of the used photon-number moments, the measurement results are easy to correct for losses and additive noise. We provide examples of simple amplification-based measurement schemes where our witness can be applied directly, thereby opening pathways to proof-of-principle tests and applications.</description>

Abstract: We present two new types of syndrome extraction circuits for the color code. Our first construction, which after [M. McEwen, D. Bacon, and C. Gidney, Quantum 7, 1172 (2023)] we call the semi-wiggling color code, promises to mitigate leakage errors by periodically interchanging the roles of bulk data and measurement qubits. The second construction reduces circuit depth relative to [C. Gidney and C. Jones, arXiv:2312.08813 (2023)] by employing the CXSWAP gate instead of CNOT. This optimization leads to $\sim 10\%$ improvement in teraquop footprint under the uniform error model with the physical error rate $p=0.1\%$.</description>

Abstract: The no-cloning theorem can be used as a basis for quantum money constructions which guarantee unconditionally unforgeable currency. Existing schemes, however, either (i) require long-term quantum memory and quantum communication between the user and the bank in order to verify the validity of a bill or (ii) fail to protect user privacy due to the uniqueness of each bill issued by the bank, which can allow its usage to be tracked. We introduce a construction of single-use quantum money that gives users the ability to detect whether the issuing authority is tracking them, employing an auditing procedure for which we prove unconditional security. Bill validation is classical, and hence does not require long-term quantum memory or quantum communication, making the protocol relatively practical to deploy. We discuss potential applications beyond money, including anonymous one-time pads and voting.</description>

Abstract: We study a hybrid system formed by an ensemble of colour nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond interacting with a superconducting flux-qubit at finite temperature. The presence of impurities in the system is modelled through pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonian, by introducing an asymmetry parameter in the interaction between the superconducting flux qubit and the ensemble of colour nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. We construct the exact grand partition function of the system, and from it we derive the thermodynamic quantities, e.g. entropy, internal energy, and Helmholtz free energy. In the broken symmetry phase, we observe the existence of zeros in the partition function. These zeros are related to the existence of complex-pair-conjugate eigenvalues with real parts lying among the low levels of energy. In line with the Yang-Lee framework, these zeros in the complex plane signal phase transitions, and the proposed hybrid model exhibits transitions of first-order. To account for metastable regions in parameter space, we perform a Maxwell construction and a spinodal-decomposition analysis. We determine the critical temperature at which the first zero of the partition-function appears, as a function of the asymmetry parameter and the coupling constant of the interaction between the ensemble of colour nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond and the superconducting flux-qubit. We also design a Carnot cycle that traverses Exceptional Points in the broken symmetry phase for temperatures above the critical value, achieving the same efficiency as the classical Carnot cycle. Furthermore, we implement a Stirling cycle whose efficiency surpasses its classical counterpart, particularly when operating near Exceptional Points. Finally, we outline how the model can be scaled to larger Hilbert-space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB method for radial Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit exact WKB quantization for radial Schr\"odinger problems from the modern resurgence perspective, with emphasis on how ``physically meaningful'' quantization paths should be chosen and interpreted. Using connection formulae at simple turning points and at regular singular points, we show that the nontrivial-cycle data give the spectrum. In particular, for the $3$-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the $3$-dimensional Coulomb potential, we explicitly compute a closed contour which starts at $+\infty$, bulges into the $r&lt;0$ sector to encircle the origin, and returns to $+\infty$. Also we propose that the appropriate slice of the closed path provides a physical local basis at $r=0$, which is used by an origin-to-$\infty$ open path. Via the change of variables $r=e^x$ ($x\in(-\infty,\infty)$), the origin data are pushed to the boundary condition of convergence at $x\to-\infty$, which renders the equivalence between open-connection and closed-cycle quantization transparent. The Maslov contribution from the regular singularity is incorporated either as a small-circle monodromy which is justified in terms of renormalization group, or, equivalently, as a boundary phase; we also develop an optimized/variational perturbation theory on exact WKB. Our analysis clarifies, in radial settings, how mathematical monodromy data and physical boundary conditions dovetail, thereby addressing recent debates on path choices in resurgence-based quantization.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Enhanced Adversarial Robustness with Rydberg Reservoir Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) leverages the high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics inherent in quantum many-body systems for extracting spatiotemporal patterns in sequential and time-series data with minimal training overhead. Although QRC inherits the expressive capabilities associated with quantum encodings, recent studies indicate that quantum classifiers based on variational circuits remain susceptible to adversarial perturbations. In this perspective, we investigate the first systematic evaluation of adversarial robustness in a QRC based learning model. Our reservoir comprises an array of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms governed by a fixed Hamiltonian, which naturally evolves under complex quantum dynamics, producing high-dimensional embeddings. A lightweight multilayer perceptron serves as the trainable readout layer. We utilize the balanced datasets, namely MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST, as a benchmark for rigorously evaluating the impact of augmenting the quantum reservoir with a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) in white-box adversarial attacks to assess its robustness. We demonstrate that this approach yields significantly higher accuracy than purely classical models across all perturbation strengths tested. This hybrid approach reveals a new source of quantum advantage and provides practical guidance for the secure deployment of machine learning models on quantum-centric supercomputing with near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott Decay of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators in Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the Liouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the slowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study the kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of the OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic gap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between integrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics and energy-gap scaling in $k-$local spin Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of all-to-all interacting spin Hamiltonians acting on exactly $k$ spins, whose coupling coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For $\mu = 0$, we demonstrate that the random matrix ensemble -- Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), or Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE) -- is determined by the parity of system size $L$ and locality $k$, following standard time-reversal symmetry classification. For couplings with a nonzero mean, we map the Hamiltonians to deformed random matrix ensembles and analyze conditions for an energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. For $\mu &lt; 0$, we find two distinct regimes: for $k \gg \sqrt{L}$, the gap closes at critical disorder $\sigma_{c} \approx |\mu|$. Near this transition the energy gap $\Delta$ exhibits universal quadratic scaling $\Delta /L \sim (\sigma - \sigma_{c})^{2}$. When $k \ll \sqrt{L}$, $\sigma_{c}$ scales with $|\mu|$, but lacks a sharp transition. Our work introduces a semi-solvable model that captures universal features of random-matrix statistics, and spectral gap formation, providing a foundation for systematic extensions to more general many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Field-Trial Quantum Key Distribution with Qubit-Based Frame Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic technique that uses quantum mechanical principles to enable secure key exchange. Practical deployment of QKD requires robust, cost-effective systems that can operate in challenging field environments. A major challenge is achieving reliable clock synchronization without adding hardware complexity. Conventional approaches often use separate classical light signals, which increase costs and introduce noise that degrades quantum channel performance. To address this limitation, we demonstrate a QKD system incorporating a recently proposed qubit-based distributed frame synchronization method, deployed over a metropolitan fiber network in Nanning, China. Using the polarization-encoded one-decoy-state BB84 protocol and the recently proposed qubit-based distributed frame synchronization method, our system achieves synchronization directly from the quantum signal, eliminating the need for dedicated synchronization hardware. Furthermore, to counteract dynamic polarization disturbances in urban fibers, the system integrates qubit-based polarization feedback control, enabling real-time polarization compensation through an automated polarization controller using data recovered from the qubit-based synchronization signals. During 12 hours of continuous operation, the system maintained a low average quantum bit error rate (QBER) of 1.12/%, achieving a secure key rate of 26.6 kbit/s under 18 dB channel loss. Even under a high channel loss of 40 dB, a finite-key secure rate of 115 bit/s was achieved. This study represents the first successful long-term validation of a frame-synchronization based QKD scheme in a real urban environment, demonstrating exceptional stability and high-loss tolerance, and offering an alternative for building practical, scalable, and cost-efficient quantum-secure communication networks.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Eavesdropper Alliance: How to Achieve Symmetric Privacy in Quantum $X$-Secure $B$-Byzantine $E$-Eavesdropped $U$-Unresponsive $T$-Colluding PIR?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum \emph{symmetric} private information retrieval (QSPIR) problem in a system with $N$ databases and $K$ messages, with $U$ unresponsive servers, $T$-colluding servers, and $X$-security parameter, under several fundamental threat models. In the first model, there are $\mathcal{E}_1$ eavesdropped links in the uplink direction (the direction from the user to the $N$ servers), $\mathcal{E}_2$ eavesdropped links in the downlink direction (the direction from the servers to the user), where $|\mathcal{E}_1|, |\mathcal{E}_2| \leq E$; we coin this eavesdropper setting as \emph{dynamic} eavesdroppers. We show that super-dense coding gain can be achieved for some regimes. In the second model, we consider the case with Byzantine servers, i.e., servers that can coordinate to devise a plan to harm the privacy and security of the system together with static eavesdroppers, by listening to the same links in both uplink and downlink directions. It is important to note the considerable difference between the two threat models, since the eavesdroppers can take huge advantage of the presence of the Byzantine servers. Unlike the previous works in SPIR with Byzantine servers, that assume that the Byzantine servers can send only random symbols independent of the stored messages, we follow the definition of Byzantine servers in \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where the Byzantine servers can send symbols that can be functions of the storage, queries, as well as the random symbols in a way that can produce worse harm to the system. In the third and the most novel threat model, we consider the presence of Byzantine servers and dynamic eavesdroppers together. We show that having dynamic eavesdroppers along with Byzantine servers in the same system model creates more threats to the system than having static eavesdroppers with Byzantine servers.</description>

      <title>Programmable photonic waveguide arrays: opportunities and challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rising complexity of photonic applications, ranging from quantum computing to neuromorphic processing, has driven the demand for highly programmable and scalable photonic integrated circuits. While mesh-based architectures built from Mach-Zehnder interferometers have enabled significant advances, their reliance on beam splitting and light bending introduces optical loss, fabrication challenges, and scalability bottlenecks. Continuously lateral-coupled integrated waveguide arrays (WAs), by contrast, offer compact systems with no direct free-space analogs, but their static nature has limited their utility. Recently, programmable waveguide arrays (PWAs) have emerged as a promising alternative, combining the Hamiltonian richness of WAs with tunable control. This perspective outlines the conceptual foundations, recent progress, and future potential of PWAs across quantum simulation, photonic neural networks, topological photonics, and nonlinear optics. We examine the theoretical and practical challenges of modeling, fabrication, and control, and propose PWAs as a next-generation architecture for compact, reconfigurable photonic processors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing optical lattice clock coherence times with erasure conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing coherent interrogation times is central to advancing the precision of optical clocks. Synchronous differential optical clock comparisons have now demonstrated atomic coherence times that far exceed the coherence time of the clock laser. While atom coherence times are then primarily limited by errors induced by lattice Raman scattering, excited clock state radiative decay, and broadening from two-body collisions, many of these errors take the atoms out of the clock transition subspace, and can therefore be converted into "erasure" errors if the appropriate readout scheme is employed. Here we experimentally demonstrate a hyperfine-resolved readout technique for ${}^{87}$Sr optical lattice clocks that mitigates decoherence from Raman scattering induced by the lattice as well as radiative decay. By employing hyperfine-resolved readout in synchronous differential comparisons between ${}^{87}$Sr ensembles with both Ramsey and spin echo spectroscopy sequences, we achieve enhanced atomic coherence times exceeding 100 s and 150 s, respectively, enabling longer coherent measurements without a reduction in performance. We anticipate that this hyperfine-resolved readout technique will benefit applications of state-of-the-art optical lattice clock comparisons in which the coherence times are constrained by Raman scattering or radiative decay.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the concept of activity itself. In this Letter, we achieve two distinct, yet complementary main results. First, we introduce a general definition of dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling, which reveals the breakdown of standard KURs at strong coupling. Second, we prove a novel uncertainty relation valid at arbitrary coupling strength, which we denote Quantum KUR (QKUR). This QKUR corresponds to a nontrivial quantum extension of KUR, involving fundamental contributions of the generalized dynamical activity. These two achievements provide a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis, in close analogy with the transition from TURs to QTURs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 046302]. Explicit steady-state expressions are obtained within Green's-function and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magneto-optical trapping of molecules has thus far been restricted to molecules with $^2\Sigma$ electronic ground states. These species are chemically reactive and only support a simple laser cooling scheme from their first excited rotational level. Here, we demonstrate a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of aluminum monofluoride (AlF), a deeply bound and intrinsically stable diatomic molecule with a $^1\Sigma^+$ electronic ground state. The MOT operates on the strong A$^1\Pi\leftarrow{}$X$^1\Sigma^+$ transition near 227.5~nm, whose Q$(J)$ lines are all rotationally closed. We demonstrate a MOT of about $6\times 10^4$ molecules for the $J=1$ level of AlF, more than $10^4$ molecules for $J=2$ and $3$, and with no fundamental limit in going to higher rotational levels. Laser cooling and trapping of AlF is conceptually similar to the introduction of alkaline-earth atoms into cold atom physics, and is key to leveraging its spin-forbidden a$^3\Pi \leftarrow{}$X$^1\Sigma^+$ transition for precision spectroscopy and narrow-line cooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.</description>

Abstract: A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT), as an efficient method of producing cold atoms from room-temperature atomic vapor, has been widely used to develop atomic sensors. Various compact MOTs using a single laser beam have been reported, simplifying apparatuses and leading to miniaturized devices. Here, we propose single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back pyramidal and conical mirrors. In such back-to-back mirrors, a MOT trapping volume is formed by an incident laser beam, a retroreflected beam, and multiple reflections from the mirror surfaces. We present the design of back-to-back mirrors and a series of compact MOT configurations, with the potential of increasing access to the MOT and simultaneously creating multiple MOTs. We demonstrate a MOT in a back-to-back conical mirror, loading 10 million rubidium-87 atoms from background vapor and cooling the atoms to 7 {\mu}K using polarization gradients. Single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back mirrors will contribute to building compact and scalable cold-atom-based sensors.</description>

Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>

Abstract: We investigate the formation of moir\'e quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the inverse participation ratio and the density wave amplitude reveal the stage for the emergence of moir\'e quasicrystal patterns, whose symmetry can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moir\'e quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>The Many Faces of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.</description>
