      <title>The Quantum Vacuum of Spacetime with a Fundamental Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum theory of gravity implies a fine-grained structure of spacetime, which can be conveniently modeled as some form of pixelation at the Planck scale, with potentially observable consequences. In this work, we build upon previous results to investigate the effect of pixelation on the quantum vacuum, making use of the framework of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR). At the center of the DSR approach is an observer dependent length scale, defining the pixelation of spacetime. A key feature of quantum field theory in DSR is the dispersive nature of the vacuum state and the associated appearance of curvature in momentum space. As a result, the standard treatment of the renormalized stress-energy-momentum tensor acquires correction terms. As an illustration, we present here a calculation of the thermal vacuum and modified Casimir effect, using both modified propagators and momentum measures. We choose a consistent choice of momentum space metric that both generates the modified dispersion relations we use and preserves the Lorentz invariant character of the results obtained. Put together this constitutes a consistent calculation framework we can apply to other more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neutron-star seismology with realistic, finite-temperature nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oscillation spectrum of a neutron star is notably rich and intrinsically dependent on the equation of state of nuclear matter. With recent advancements in gravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy, we are nearing the capability to perform neutron-star asteroseismology and probe the complex physics of neutron stars. With this in mind, we explore the implementation of three-parameter finite-temperature matter models in the computation of neutron-star oscillations. We consider in detail the thermodynamics of nuclear matter and show how this information enters the problem. Our realistic treatment takes into account entropy and composition gradients that exist in the nuclear matter, giving rise to buoyant g-mode oscillations. To illustrate the implementation, we determine the oscillation spectrum of a low-temperature neutron star. In addition to the expected compositional and thermal g-modes, we find perturbations sourced by phase transitions in the equation of state. We also examine the thermal evolution of the oscillation spectrum of a neutron star with constant redshifted temperature.</description>

      <title>Binary neutron star mergers in massive scalar-tensor theory: Properties of post-merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of post-merger remnants of binary neutron star mergers in the framework of Damour-Esposito-Farese-type scalar-tensor theory of gravity with a massive scalar field by numerical relativity simulation. It is found that the threshold mass for prompt collapse is raised in the presence of the excited scalar field. Our simulation results also suggest the existence of long-lived $\phi-$mode in hypermassive neutron stars due to the presence of the massive scalar field which enhances the quasi-radial oscillation in the remnant. We investigate the descalarization condition in hypermassive neutron stars and discover a distinctive signature in post-merger gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we aim at developing a new class of high order accurate well-balanced
  finite difference (FD) Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) methods for numerical general relativity,
  which can be applied to any first--order reduction of the Einstein field equations, even if non--conservative terms are present.
  We choose the first--order non--conservative Z4 formulation of the Einstein equations, which
  has a built--in cleaning procedure that accounts for the Einstein constraints and that
  has already shown its ability in keeping stationary solutions stable over long timescales.

      <description>arXiv:2406.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a class of Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a scalar field (TNS) by applying the Ehlers transformation on the exact solutions that was recently introduced in arXiv: 2307.09328 and arXiv: 2307.13588. Furthermore, we investigate the effective potential, geodesics, topological charge, and quasinormal modes (QNMs) for the obtained TNS metrics. We also use conformal transformations to generate a new class of exact solutions of the Einstein-conformal-scalar theory by using the obtained TNS solutions as seed metrics. Finally we compare QNMs of the class of exact solutions.</description>

      <title>On Nanocones as a Gravitational Analog System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the fundamental properties of graphene and boron nitride (BN) nanostructures, exploring their torsional energy characteristics within the framework of Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR). By constructing nanocones with disclination defects in these materials, we investigate the linear dependence of torsional energy on the disclination angle, as predicted by TEGR. The qualitative validation of TEGR's energy expression is supported by our simulations, which show a strong correlation between the torsional energy and the disclination angle, consistent with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we propose a quantitative analysis by estimating the coupling constant $k$ associated with TEGR through molecular simulations and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Our results suggest that $k$ reflects the interatomic forces within the materials, providing insights into the nature of spacetime and gravitational interactions on a microscopic scale. These findings not only contribute to our understanding of material physics but also offer implications for the precision and validity of TEGR in describing gravitational phenomena.</description>

      <title>Black hole in a generalized Chaplygin-Jacobi dark fluid: shadow and light deflection angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized Chaplygin-like gas with an anisotropic equation of state, characterizing a dark fluid within which a static spherically symmetric black hole is assumed. By solving the Einstein equations for this black hole spacetime, we explicitly derive the metric function. The spacetime is parametrized by two critical parameters, $\mathcal{B}$ and $\alpha$, which measure the deviation from the Schwarzschild black hole and the extent of the dark fluid's anisotropy, respectively. We explore the behavior of light rays in the vicinity of the black hole by calculating its shadow and comparing our results with the Event Horizon Telescope observations. This comparison constrains the parameters to $0 \leq \mathcal{B} &lt; 0.03$ and $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0.1$. Additionally, we calculate the deflection angles to determine the extent to which light is bent by the black hole. These calculations are further utilized to formulate possible Einstein rings, estimating the angular radius of the rings to be approximately $37.6\,\mathrm{\mu as}$. Throughout this work, we present analytical solutions wherever feasible, and employ reliable approximations where necessary to provide comprehensive insights into the spacetime characteristics and their observable effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the integration of quantum algorithms, specifically Grover's algorithm, with quantum metrology to enhance the efficiency and sensitivity of gravitational-wave detection. By combining quantum matched filtering with precise parameter estimation techniques, the research aims to optimize sensor networks for the identification of gravitational waves. This integrated approach leverages the strengths of quantum superposition and entanglement to improve signal detection, reduce noise, and strategically place sensors. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in the sensitivity and accuracy of gravitational wave measurements, highlighting the potential of quantum technologies to revolutionize observational astronomy and enhance our understanding of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact stars have long served as a test bed of gravitational models and their coupling with stellar matter. In this work, we explore the behavior of an exponential model in f(T) gravity through the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This is performed for different envelope thicknesses. Finally, constraints on the models parameters are obtained, which are comparable to the results obtained using cosmological survey data. This consistency across the strong astrophysical and weak cosmological scales shows reasonable viability of the underlying model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the novel phenomenon of gravitational lensing experienced by gravitational waves traveling past a Schwarzschild black hole perturbed by a specific, first-order, polar gravitational wave. We utilize the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, uncovering a topological contribution to the deflection of light rays passing near the black hole. We demonstrate that the deflection angle can be determined by analyzing a region entirely outside the light ray's path, leading to a calculation based solely on the parameters of the perturbing wave (Legendre polynomial order, $l$, and frequency, $\sigma$). This approach offers a unique perspective on gravitational lensing and expands our understanding of black hole interactions with gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>An information geometric probe for charged black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glavan and Lin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 081301 (2020)] have recently proposed a consistent model of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity in four spacetime dimensions. This model predicts significant contributions of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha$ to gravitational dynamics, while circumventing the Lovelock theorem and avoiding Ostrogradsky instability. As a powerful competitor to general relativity, the model has been examined on various phenomenological grounds. Here, we employ a technique from thermodynamic geometry to analyze the thermodynamic phase structure of a charged black hole with a quantum gravity-inspired entropy relation in this novel modified gravity scenario. Based on the sign and magnitude of thermodynamic curvature, we demonstrate that while the theory does not significantly impact larger black holes, it may lead to multiple phase transitions and accelerate the formation of black hole remnants at short-distance scales compared to general relativity. Our analysis focuses solely on the non-extremal geometry case where $M&gt;\sqrt{Q^2+\alpha}$, with $M$ and $Q$ representing the mass and charge of the black hole, respectively. We believe that these results may offer insights for testing the phenomenological consistency of the theory as a potential alternative to the standard Einstein paradigm.</description>

      <title>Bubbles kick off primordial black holes to form more binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may form before cosmological first-order phase transitions, leading to inevitable collisions between PBHs and bubble walls. In this Letter, we have simulated for the first time the co-evolution of an expanding scalar wall passing through a black hole with full numerical relativity. This black hole-bubble wall collision yields multiple far-reaching phenomena including the PBH mass growth, gravitational wave radiations, and momentum recoil that endows PBHs with additional velocities, approximately doubling the formation rate for PBH binaries and hence strengthening the observational constraints on the PBH abundances.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Torsion on Neutron Star Structure in Einstein-Cartan Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein--Cartan gravity is a close historical sibling of general relativity that allows for spacetime torsion. As a result, angular momentum couples to spacetime geometry in a similar way to energy. While consequences of this are well studied on cosmological scales, their role in neutron star physics is largely under-explored. We study the effects that torsion, sourced by either microphysical spin or macroscopic angular momentum, has on neutron stars. For this, we use a simplified polytropic model to quantify the microphysical coupling to torsion. We also derive expressions to model rotation-induced torsion effects and estimate the consequences for rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates. We find that the presence of torsion in general leads to neutron stars with smaller radii and masses, but higher central densities. Realistic models for microphysical spin lead to torsion effects that have no relevant influence on the neutron star structure. Rotation-induced torsion effects however, can decrease the radius by up to $900\,m$, which is comparable to the increase due to centrifugal forces. Depending on which effect dominates, this leads to a torsion-induced spin-up or spin-down of the neutron star. We conclude that torsion effects due to rotation can not be neglected and are large enough to be tested using current or near-future technology.</description>

      <title>Charged black holes in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electrically charged, static, spherically symmetric black holes in quadratic gravity using the conformal-to-Kundt technique, which leads to a considerable simplification of the field equations. We study the solutions using a Frobenius-like approach of power-series expansions. The indicial equations restrict the set of possible leading powers to a few cases, describing, e.g., black holes, wormholes, or naked singularities.
  We focus on the black hole case and derive recurrent formulas for all series coefficients of the infinite power-series expansion around the horizon. The solution is characterized by electric charge $q$, the black-hole radius $a_0$, and the Bach parameter $b$ related to the strength of the Bach tensor at the horizon. However, the Bach parameter has to be fine-tuned to ensure asymptotic flatness. The fine-tuning of $b$ for a given $q$ and $a_0$ returns up to two values, describing two branches of asymptotically flat, static, spherically symmetric, charged black holes in quadratic gravity. This is in agreement with previous numerical works.
  We discuss various physical properties of these black holes, such as their asymptotic mass, temperature, photon spheres, and black-hole shadows. A straightforward generalization to dyonic black holes in quadratic gravity is also briefly mentioned.</description>

      <title>A primer on the analogue black hole bomb with capillary-gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Draining vortices with a free surface are frequently employed as rotating black hole simulators, both in theory and experiments. However, most theoretical work is restricted to the idealised regime, where wave dispersion and dissipation are neglected. We investigate the role of these effects on the analogue black hole bomb, an instability resulting from rotational superradiant amplification in confined systems. We reveal that the dispersion of deep water capillary-gravity waves significantly modifies the unstable mode eigenfrequencies, whereas viscosity only affects those with high frequencies. Furthermore, if the circulation is less than an order 1 multiple of the drain rate, superradiance does not occur and the vortex is stable. The instability is maximised in small systems with high flow velocities, provided there is sufficient space between the vortex and the outer boundary for the first excited state to lie inside the superradiant bandwidth. Implications for experiments on analogue black holes and free surface vortices are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological coupling of spherical, local astrophysical systems. We derive a general formula quantifying the cosmological coupling of the Misner-Sharp mass of these objects. We show that, in the weak-field limit, the cosmological coupling is only allowed if there are pressure anisotropies. We also apply our results to galaxies, modelling them with the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles. We show that the galactic mass can be coupled to the cosmological dynamics and examine its dependence on the scale factor of the universe.</description>

We demonstrate that our model, \texttt{AWaRe}, effectively recovers gravitational waves with parameters it has not encountered during training. This includes features like higher black hole masses, additional harmonics, eccentricity, and varied waveform systematics, which introduce complex modulations in the waveform's amplitudes and phases. The accurate reconstructions of these unseen signal characteristics demonstrates \texttt{AWaRe}'s ability to handle complex features in the waveforms. By directly incorporating waveform reconstruction uncertainty estimation into the \texttt{AWaRe} framework, we show that for real gravitational wave events, the uncertainties in \texttt{AWaRe}'s reconstructions align closely with those achieved by benchmark algorithms like BayesWave and coherent WaveBurst. The robustness of our model to real gravitational wave events and its ability to extrapolate to unseen data open new avenues for investigations in various aspects of gravitational wave astrophysics and data analysis, including tests of General Relativity and the enhancement of current gravitational wave search methodologies.</description>

Abstract: Thawing quintessence scalar field models with the various potential forms to explain the late-time cosmic acceleration are compared to the {\Lambda}CDM model in detail by analyzing cosmological parameters with a set of observational data including H(z), BAO, CMB, SNIa, BBN, and f(z){\sigma}8 at the background and the perturbation levels. At low redshifts for the thawing quintessence scalar field models, the growth rate of the cosmic structure is significant. By utilizing a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure based on the recent expansion and the growth observational data with the statistical values of the Akaike and the Bayesian information criteria, we discuss the consistency of the thawing quintessence scalar field models with the set of different potentials with the observational data. The main consequence of this work is that despite the various considered potential forms that are very popular in the literature, we should be looking for consistent potential forms with observational data.

      <title>Cosmic Censorship in Sgr A* and M87*: Observationally Excluding Naked Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The imaging of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) and the supermassive black hole at the center of Messier 87 (M87*) by the Event Horizon Telescope constrains the location and nature of emission from these objects. Coupled with flux limits from the near-infrared through the ultraviolet, the attendant size constraints provide strong evidence for the absence of an accretion-powered photosphere, and therefore for the existence of an event horizon about an astrophysical black hole. Here, we demonstrate that a broad class of naked singularities are also generically excluded, regardless of the nature and unknown physical impact of singularity itself, subject to a single weak assumption about locality. While we restrict our attention to static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, we are nevertheless able to exclude a large number of commonly invoked naked singularity spacetimes in this way.</description>

      <title>Effects of rotation and anisotropy on the properties of type-II holographic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work concerns the detailed construction of a holographic model for a type-II s-wave superconductor defined on a 5-dimensional anisotropic rotating black hole. We examine the role of rotation and anisotropy on the properties of the superconductor model focusing on the condensate and the AC conductivity, for which we obtain closed formulas, using both analytical and numerical methods. The results reveal that the rotation is responsible for the appearance of a peak and for introducing an exponentially vanishing behavior in the high-frequency limit of the real component of the AC conductivity. Such a behavior aligns with that observed in high-temperature superconductor models and experiments, where the peak and vanishing behavior result from quasiparticle damping, suggesting a plausible relation between the rotation of a black hole and quasiparticle damping effects in a superconducting material. In addition, we provide a detailed construction of the vortex lattice presented in arXiv:2208.05988 and study its behavior as a function of an external uniform magnetic field. Once again, it is shown that the vortex lattice can be continuously deformed along with a change in the vortex population by virtue of the magnetic field, providing a promising avenue for holographically modeling the vortex lattice deformations observed in experimental superconducting materials. As an observed experimental effect, we describe both the vortex lattice deformation and the vortex population increment under the action of an external magnetic field in the LiFeAs type-II superconductor. These effects supplement those previously found for the FeSe type-II superconductor studied in arXiv:2208.05988.</description>

      <title>The quantum-refractive evolution of polarization states in pulsar emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly magnetized neutron stars have quantum refraction effects on pulsar emission due to the non-linearity of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) action. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the polarization states under the quantum refraction effects combined with the frequency dependence of pulsar emission; we solve a system of evolution equations of the Stokes vector, where the birefringent vector, in which such effects are encoded, acts on the Stokes vector. At a fixed frequency of emission, depending on the magnitude of the birefringent vector, dominated mostly by the magnetic field strength, the evolution of the Stokes vector largely exhibits three different patterns: (i) monotonic, or (ii) half-oscillatory, or (iii) highly oscillatory behaviours. These features are understood and confirmed by means of approximate analytical solutions to the evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Generational Black Hole Population Analysis with an Astrophysically Informed Mass Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the population statistics of black holes in the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog using a parametric mass function derived from simulations of massive stars experiencing pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISN). Our formalism enables us to separate the black hole mass function into sub-populations corresponding to mergers between objects formed via different astrophysical pathways, allowing us to infer the properties of black holes formed from stellar collapse and black holes formed via prior mergers separately. Applying this formalism, we find that this model fits the data better than the powerlaw+peak model with Bayes factor $ 9.7\pm0.1$. We measure the location of the lower edge of the upper black hole mass gap to be $M_{\rm BHMG}=84.05_{-12.88}^{+17.19}{\rm M}_{\odot}$, providing evidence that the $35{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Gaussian peak detected in the data using other models is not associated with the PPISN pile-up predicted to precede this gap. Incorporating spin, we find that the normalized spins of stellar remnant black holes are close to zero while those of higher generation black holes tend to larger values. All of these results are in accordance with the predictions of stellar structure theory and black hole merger scenarios. Finally, we combine our mass function with the spectral siren method for measuring the Hubble constant to find $H_0=36.19_{-10.91}^{17.50}$ km/s/Mpc and discuss potential explanations of this low value. Our results demonstrate how astrophysically-informed mass functions can facilitate the interpretation of gravitational wave catalog data to provide information about black hole formation and cosmology. Future data releases will improve the precision of our measurements.</description>

      <title>Exploring the rich geometrical information in cosmic drift signals with covariant cosmography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time measurements are becoming feasible in cosmology, where the next generation of telescopes will detect the temporal change of redshifts and sky positions of individual sources with a precision that will allow a direct detection of the cosmic expansion rate. These detections of cosmic drifts of redshifts and positions are likely to become cornerstones in modern cosmology, where one has otherwise relied on the indirect inference of cosmic expansion by estimation of the slope of the fitted distance-redshift relation. Because of their ability to directly detect the cosmic time-evolution, real-time measurements are powerful as model-independent probes. We develop a cosmographic framework for analysing cosmological redshift drift and position drift signals without knowledge of the space-time geometry. The framework can be applied to analyse data from surveys such as the Gaia observatory, the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). The drift effects are distorted by the regional kinematics and tidal effects in the cosmic neighbourhood of the observer, giving rise to non-trivial corrections to the well known Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) results. We discuss how one may concretely implement the framework in the statistical analysis of real-time data, along with assumptions and limitations that come with such an analysis. We also discuss the geometrical information that can ideally be extracted from ideal high-resolution data of cosmic drifts in combination with distance-redshift data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing frequentist profile likelihoods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES dataset at up to $2.5 \sigma$ level. At the highest redshifts, one encounters negative dark energy densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the genealogy of LIGO-Virgo black holes</title>

Abstract: We propose a Bayesian inference framework to predict the merger history of LIGO-Virgo binary black holes, whose binary components may have undergone hierarchical mergers in the past. The framework relies on numerical relativity predictions for the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant black holes. This proposed framework computes the masses, spins, and kicks imparted to the remnant of the parent binaries, given the initial masses and spin magnitudes of the binary constituents. We validate our approach by performing an "injection study" based on a constructed sequence of hierarchically-formed binaries. Noise is added to the final binary in the sequence, and the parameters of the 'parent' and 'grandparent' binaries in the merger chain are then reconstructed. This method is then applied to three GWTC-3 events: GW190521, GW200220_061928, GW190426_190642. These events were selected because at least one of the binary companions lies in the putative pair-instability supernova mass gap, in which stellar processes alone cannot produce black holes. Hierarchical mergers offer a natural explanation for the formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass-gap. We use the backward evolution framework to predict the parameters of the parents of the primary companion of these three binaries. Our results indicate that at least one component of these three observed binaries was formed through a prior binary black hole merger. This approach can be readily applied to future high-mass gravitational wave events to predict their formation history under the hierarchical merger assumption.</description>

Abstract: The gauge formalism in telepalallel gravity provides an interesting viewpoint to describe interactions according to an anholonomic observer's tetrad basis. Without going into assessing the complete viability of quantization in an early stage, this paper explores classical gravity within the framework of a classical-to-quantum bridge between the SU$(1, 3)$ Yang--Mills gauge formalism and the gauge-like treatment of teleparallel gravity. Specifically, the perturbed spacetime algebra with Weitzenb\"ock connection can be assimilated to a local complexification based on the SU$(1,3)$ Yang--Mills theory, what we call hypercolour or, simply, colour. The formulation of the hypercolour dynamics is build by a translational gauge, as in the teleparallel gravities. In particular, this work analyses small perturbations of a metric decomposition related to the Wilson line and the Kaluza--Klein metric, but obtaining electrodynamics in four dimensions. The spacetime coordinates are now matrices representing elements of the $\mathfrak{su}(1,3)$ algebra. To make compatible the formulation of a coloured gravity with the Lorentz force and the Maxwell's equations, it is enough to define every energy potential origin as 0 in the event horizon instead of the classic zero potential at infinity. Under the coloured gravity framework, standard electromagnetism can be obtained as a particular abelian case.</description>

Abstract: How the spacetime evolved non-perturbatively in a landscape with multiple anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacua, which is theoretically well-motivated, has always been a matter of concern. As a step towards this issue, we perform (3+1)D numerical relativity simulations for the inhomogeneous universe in an AdS landscape, and find that large inhomogeneity of scalar field can develop into not only sphere-like bubbles, but also novel tube-like structures. It is observed that the bubble or tube wall (across the potential barrier) likely inflates as a quasi-dS space, while the different regions separated by the walls are in different AdS vacua and will collapse towards singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering ($1+1$)-dimensional fluid in presence of gravitational trace anomaly, as an effective description of higher-dimensional fluid, the hydrodynamics is discussed through a first order thermodynamic description. Contrary to the existing approaches which are second order in nature, the fluid velocity is identified through the auxiliary field required to describe the Polyakov action for the effective description of relevant energy-momentum tensor. The thermodynamic and fluid quantities, on a static black hole spacetime, are calculated both near the horizon as well as at the asymptotic infinity. The Unruh vacuum appears to be suitable one for the present analysis, in contrast to Israel-Hartle-Hawking vacuum which is consistent with second order description. As in anomaly cancellation approach to find the Hawking flux the Unruh vacuum is consistent with the required conditions, in reverse way we interpret this fluid description as an alternative approach to find these required conditions to calculate the same in anomaly cancellation approach.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear character of general relativity leaves its imprint in the coalescence of two black holes, from the inspiral to the final ringdown stage. To quantify the impact of nonlinearities, we work at second order in black hole perturbation theory and we study the excitation of second-order modes relative to the first-order modes that drive them as we vary the black hole spin and the initial data for the perturbations. The relative amplitude of second-order modes is only mildly dependent on the initial data that we consider, but it strongly decreases for large black hole spins. This implies that the extrapolation of calculations based on the Kerr-CFT correspondence to subextremal Kerr black holes should be viewed with caution.</description>

Abstract: To obtain the waveform template of gravitational waves (GWs), substantial computational resources and exceedingly high precision are often required. In the previous study [JCAP 11 (2023) 070], we efficiently and accurately calculate GW fluxes of a particle in circular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole using the confluent Heun function. We extend the previous method to calculate the asymptotic GW fluxes from a particle in generic orbits around a near-extreme Kerr black hole. Especially when dealing with the computational difficulties in large eccentricity $e=0.9$, higher spin $a=0.999$, higher harmonic modes, and strong-field regions, our results are much better than the results of the numerical integration method based on the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method.</description>

      <title>Constraining tensor-to-scalar ratio based on VLBI observations: PGWs induced-incoherence approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we show that the background of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) predicted by the inflationary scenario induce a decrease of the spatial coherence length of an electromagnetic field propagating over cosmological distances, leading the van Citter-Zernike correlations to eventually be unobservable, an affect called as blurring. Since this spatial correlation is actually observed in VLBI measurements of distant quasars, it imposes a constraint on the level of the primordial gravitational waves background. In this paper, we precisely evaluate this blurring effect by considering the primordial gravitational waves background to be in the so-called two-mode squeezed state, which is the standard quantum state predicted by the simplest scenario of inflation. We then exploit a sample of compact radio quasars located at redshift range $0.46\leq z \leq 2.73$ observed by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) means. These quasars constitute a standard ruler and the angular size-distance $\theta-z$ relation is determined thanks to the measurement of their spatial coherence. These spatial coherence observations set an upper limit on the squeezing parameters of the PGWs background, which turns into an upper limit for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $\text{r}_{k_0}$. One finds $\text{r}_{k_0} &lt; 10^{-7}$, five orders of magnitude better than present constraints on this parameter with the CMB. This result is nevertheless compatible with the possible detection of a cosmic background by the pulsar timing array measurement. Further issues and caveats that potentially affect the results are reviewed. In particular, the possible effect of quantum-to-classical transition of PGWs is discussed. Ultimately, we promote the idea of using high-precision VLBI measurement of angular size-redshift of distant sources as a new possible way of constraining the background of primordial tensor perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent achievements of a full general relativistic method in estimating the mass-to-distance ratio of supermassive black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei, we introduce the new concept redshift rapidity in order to express the Schwarzschild black hole mass and its distance from the Earth just in terms of observational quantities. The redshift rapidity is also an observable relativistic invariant that represents the evolution of the frequency shift with respect to proper time in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We extract concise and elegant analytic formulas that allow us to disentangle mass and distance to black holes in the Schwarzschild background and estimate these parameters separately. This procedure is performed in a completely general relativistic way with the aim of improving the precision in measuring cosmic distances to astrophysical compact objects. Our exact formulas are valid on the midline and close to the line of sight, having direct astrophysical applications for megamaser systems, whereas the general relations can be employed in black hole parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>Propagation and lensing of gravitational waves in Palatini $f(\hat R)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accelerated expansion of the Universe prompted searches of modified gravity theory beyond general relativity, instead of adding a mysterious dark energy component with exotic physical properties. One such alternative gravity approach is metric-affine Palatini $f(\hat{R})$ theory. By now routine gravitational wave detections have opened a promising avenue of searching for modified gravity effects. Future expected cases of strong lensing of gravitational waves will enhance this opportunity further. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the propagation and gravitational lensing of gravitational waves in Palatini $f(\hat R)$ gravity and compare it with general relativity. Using the WKB approximation we explore the geometric-optical limit of lensing and derive the corrections to the measured luminosity distance of the gravitational source. In addition, we study the lensing by the Singular Isothermal Sphere lens model and show that Palatini $f(\hat{R})$ modifies the lensing potential and hence the deflection angle. Then we show that the lens model and chosen theory of gravity influences the rotation of the gravitational wave polarization plane through the deflection angle. To be more specific we discuss the $f(\hat R)=\hat R+\alpha \hat R^2$ gravity theory and find that the modifications comparing to general relativity are negligible if the upper bound of $\alpha \sim 10^{9} \, $m$^2$ suggested in the literature is adopted. However, this bound is not firmly established and can be updated in the future. Therefore, the results we obtained could be valuable for further metric-affine gravity vs. general relativity tests involving lensing of gravitational waves and comparison of luminosity distances measured from electromagnetic and gravitational wave sources.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking, we consider a metric--affine generalization of the gravitational sector of the Standard--Model Extension (SME), including the Lorentz--violating (LV) coefficients $u$ and $s^{\mu\nu}$. In this model, we derive the modified Einstein field equations in order to obtain a new axisymmetric vacuum spinning solution for a particular bumblebee's profile. Such a solution has the remarkable property of incorporating the effects of Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) through the LV dimensionless parameter $X=\xi b^2$, as the LSB is turned off, $X=0$, we recover the well--established result, the Kerr solution, as expected. Afterwards, we calculate the geodesics, the radial acceleration and thermodynamic quantities for this new metric. We also estimate an upper bound for $X$ by using astrophysical data of the advance Mercury's perihelion.</description>

Abstract: We examine relativistic diffusion through the frame and observer bundles associated with a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$. Our focus is on spacetimes with a non-trivial isometry group, and we detail the conditions required to find symmetric solutions of the relativistic diffusion equation. Additionally, we analyze the conservation laws associated with the presence of Killing vector fields on $(M,g)$ and their implications for the expressions of the geodesic spray and the vertical Laplacian on both the frame and the observer bundles. Finally, we present several relevant examples of symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Stability of charged scalar hair on a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Israel-Carter theorem (also known as the ``no-hair theorem'') puts a restriction on the existence of parameters other than mass, electric charge, and angular momentum of a black hole. In this context, Bekenstein proposed no-hair theorems in various black hole models with neutral and electrically charged scalar fields.
  In this paper, we take the Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar model with an electrically charged scalar field gauge-coupled to the Maxwell field surrounding a charged black hole in the background of a static spherically symmetric metric. We ascertain the validity of all energy conditions coupled with the causality condition, suggesting the possibility of existence of charged hairy solutions. Consequently, we obtain, by exact numerical integration, detailed solutions of the field equations in this model. The solutions exhibit damped oscillatory behaviours for the charged scalar hair. We also find that the electric potential $V(r)$ is a monotonic function of $r$, as required by electrodynamics.
  Furthermore, we find that the charged hairy solutions are stable against time-dependant perturbations about the static solutions. We ascertain their stability by carrying out dynamic stability analyses, employing two different methodologies. The first methodology is based on a Sturm-Liouville equation, whereas the second methodology employs a Schr\"odinger-like equation for the dynamic perturbations. We find stability of the charged hairy solutions in both stability analyses.</description>

      <title>Quantum Isotropic Universe in RQM Analogy: the Cosmological Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the presence of a free massless scalar field, playing the role of a physical clock. The Hilbert space is constructed via a direct analogy between the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace and a relativistic scalar one in physical space. In particular, we show how the introduction of a "turning point" in the Universe evolution allows to overcome an intrinsic ambiguity in representing the expanding and collapsing Universe. In this way, the positive and negative frequencies are simply identified with time reversed states. The main subject of the present analysis is the construction of a horizon operator, whose quantum behavior is investigated when Polymer Quantum Mechanics is implemented to describe the asymptotic evolution near the initial singularity. The reason of this choice is motivated by the intrinsic spreading of localized wavepackets when the polymer dispersion relation governs the quantum dynamics. The evidence that the mean value of the quantum horizon operator follows its semiclassical behavior (corrected for polymerization) is a clear indication that a concept of causality can be restored also in the quantum cosmological picture.</description>

      <title>Validating Prior-informed Fisher-matrix Analyses against GWTC Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fisher-matrix methods are widely used to predict how accurately parameters can be estimated. Being computationally efficient, this approach is prompted by the large number of signals simulated in forecast studies for future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, for which adequate analysis tools and computational resources are still unavailable to the scientific community. However, approximating the full likelihood function with a Gaussian may lead to inaccuracies, which we investigate in this work. To assess the accuracy of the Fisher approximation, we compare the results of the Fisher code GWFish against real data from the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs (GWTCs) provided by the Virgo/LIGO Bayesian analyses. Additionally, we present a sampling algorithm to include priors in GWFish, not only to ensure a fair comparison between GWFish results and the Virgo/LIGO posteriors but also to investigate the role of prior information and to assess the need to include it in standard Fisher analyses. We find that the impact of priors depends mostly on the level of signal-dependent degeneracy of the waveform parameterization, and priors are generally more important when the level of degeneracy is high. Our findings imply that Fisher-matrix methods are a valid tool for ET science-case studies.</description>

      <title>Numerical parameterization of stationary axisymmetric black holes in a theory agnostic framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of a comprehensive theory of gravity has led to the exploration of various alternative models, necessitating a model-independent framework. The Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parameterization offers a robust method for approximating stationary axisymmetric black hole spacetimes, characterized by a rapidly converging continued-fraction expansion. However, while analytical metrics benefit from this approach, numerical metrics derived from complex gravitational theories remain presenting computational challenges. Bridging this gap, we propose a method for a numerical KRZ parameterization, tested and demonstrated on pseudo-numerical Kerr and Kerr-Sen spacetimes. Our approach involves constructing numerical grids to represent metric coefficients and using the grids for fitting the parameters up to an arbitrary order. We analyze the accuracy of our method across different orders of approximation, considering deviations in the metric functions and shadow images. In both Kerr and Kerr-Sen cases, we observe rapid convergence of errors with increasing orders of continued fractions, albeit with variations influenced by spin and charge. Our results underscore the potential of the proposed algorithm for parameterizing numerical metrics, offering a pathway for further investigations across diverse gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Apparent and emergent dark matter around a Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the two different dark matter frameworks that were studied recently: one that arises from the non-local effects of entanglement entropy as emergent gravity (characterized by the parameter $\xi(M)$, and zero-point scale length $l$), and one from dark energy viewed as a superconducting medium (characterized by $\eta(M)$, and screening length parameter $\lambda_{\rm G}$), two black hole solutions spherically surrounded with these dark matter models were derived. The effect of these two frameworks on SMBH was analyzed through the resulting deviations in the null regions and the black hole shadow. In addition, constraints to the parameters $\xi$ and $\eta$ (at $3\sigma$ level) were found using the available EHT data for Sgr. A* and M87*. These constraints allow one to deduce the effective mass $M$, which causes uncertainties in the measurement. On the other hand, if the effective mass is known, one can also deduce the constants associated with $\xi$, and $\eta$. The former framework also introduces an Appell function, a hypergeometric function of two variables that separately allows the analysis of macroscopic and (hypothetical) microscopic black holes. This first framework was found to decrease the radii of the null regions respective to the Schwarzschild counterpart. The shadow radius, however, behaves reversibly. The result of the numerical analysis for the latter framework revealed increased values for the photonsphere and shadow radii. Remarkably, the study also showed that for SMBHs, the amplifying effects of $\lambda_{\rm G}$ are stronger than the scale length $l$. Finally, results of constraints, as an example, for the upper bound in $\xi$ for M87* indicated that the effective mass causing the deviation was around $2.4\times 10^{20} M_{\odot}$ given that the observed Milgrom's constant is $5.4\times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$.</description>

      <title>Fractal signatures of non-Kerr spacetimes in the shadow of light-ring bifurcations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-ring bifurcations that can occur for prolate non-Kerr compact objects can leave an indelible signature on SMBH shadows as a fractal sequence of eyebrow-like formations. These fractal features are the result of two properties of these spacetimes. The first is that they allow for multiple escapes for the photons (throats in the effective potential of photon geodesic motion). The second is that photon geodesics can resonate between different generalized light-rings related to the escapes, called fundamental photon orbits, that lead photons to alternate between the different exits either towards the compact object or infinity. The resulting fractal structures of the shadow seem to be a generic feature of prolate non-Kerr objects that may be observable in (accretion-disk)-illuminated compact objects, especially along equatorial lines of sight, but the best orientation depends on the specific parameters. Such fractal features if observed in the shadows of singular supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, would be smoking gun signals of non-Kerr compact objects.</description>

Abstract: After black holes collide, the remnant settles to a stationary state by emitting gravitational waves. Once non-linearities subside, these ringdown waves are dominated by exponentially-damped sinusoids, or quasinormal modes. We develop a general method using perturbative spectral expansions to calculate the quasinormal-mode frequencies and damping times in a wide class of modified gravity theories for black holes with any subextremal spin. We apply this method to scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to show its accuracy, thus enabling robust ringdown tests with gravitational wave data.</description>

Abstract: The inspiral merger time for two black holes captured into a nonrelativistic bound orbit by gravitational radiation emission has been often calculated by a formula of Peters that assumes the adiabatic approximation that the changes per orbit are small. However, initially this is not true for the semimajor axis and period of most of the initially highly eccentric orbits, which change significantly during closest approach and much less elsewhere along the orbit. This effect can make the merger time much longer (using other formulas from Peters that do not assume the adiabatic approximation) than that calculated by the adiabatic formula of Peters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, Dirac Quantization of $3D$ gravity in the first-order formalism is attempted where instead of quantizing the connection and triad fields, the connection and the triad 1-forms themselves are quantized. The exterior derivative operator on the space of differential forms is treated as the `time' derivative to compute the momenta conjugate to these 1-forms. This manner of quantization allows one to compute the transition amplitude in $3D$ gravity which has a close, but not exact, match with the transition amplitude computed via LQG techniques. This inconsistency is interpreted as being due to the non-quantizable nature of differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization modes of gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing. The main result of this study is that no further scalar mode appears more than the two standard plus and cross transverse polarizations of massless tensor gravitational radiation, typical of General Relativity. This is because the first-order perturbation of connection does not modify the linearized field equations in vacuum which remain gauge invariant. Then, the world line equations of free point particles, as well as the equations of their deviations, are obtained using only the symmetric teleparallel connection. In $f(Q)$ gravity, test masses follow timelike geodesics and not autoparallel curves. In the proper reference frame, thanks to the geodesic deviation equation of the structure-less bodies in free fall, we prove that, in any gauge, only the metric perturbations $h_{\mu\nu}$, related to tensor modes, survive by exploiting the gauge invariance. Besides, scalar modes disappear. This allows us to conclude that only two degrees of freedom of linearized $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity propagate as in General Relativity and in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. The situation is different with respect to $f(R)$ gravity (with $f(R)\neq R$) where a further scalar mode is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes plays a crucial role in the modelling of post-merger ringdown signals. However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small deformations of the system and describes the linear response only in a certain (not precisely defined) timeframe after the merger. We argue here that the greybody factors, recently shown to describe the ringdown spectral amplitude at relatively high frequencies, are instead stable under small perturbations of the system and free of certain ambiguities that plague the quasinormal mode spectrum. Our analysis also unveils a nontrivial interplay: while certain ringdown quantities are dominated by the contribution of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes, these modes conspire to produce stable observables. Thus, we propose a complementary approach to ringdown studies, which circumvents some limitations of the standard quasinormal mode description.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Non-circular Deviation from the Kerr Paradigm and Its Observational Signatures: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals and Lense-Thirring Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave observations and shadow imaging have demonstrated the astonishing consistency of the Kerr paradigm despite all the special symmetries assumed in deriving the Kerr metric. Hence, it is crucial to test the presence of these symmetries in astrophysical scenarios and constraint possible deviations from them, especially in strong field regimes. With this motivation, the present work aims to investigate the theoretical consequences and observational signatures of non-circularity in a unified theory-agnostic manner. For this purpose, we construct a general non-circular metric with a small parameterized deviation from Kerr. This metric preserves the other properties of Kerr, such as stationarity, axisymmetry, asymptotic flatness, and the equatorial reflection symmetry. Apart from the resulting mathematical simplifications, this assumption is crucial to disentangle the consequences of relaxing circularity from other properties. Then, after discussing various novel theoretical consequences, we perform a detailed analysis of extreme mass ratio inspirals and Lense-Thirring precession in the context of this newly constructed metric. Our study clearly shows the promising prospects of detecting and constraining even a slight non-circular deviation from the Kerr paradigm using the future gravitational wave observations by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical transport in two-dimensional Dirac materials with spatially variable tilt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Boltzmann theory to study the semi-classical dynamics of electrons in a two-dimensional (2D) tilted Dirac material in which the tilt varies in space. The spatial variation of the tilt parameter induces a non-trivial spacetime geometry on the background of which the electrons roam about. As the first manifestation of graivto-electric phenomena, we find a geometric planar Hall effect according to which a current flows in a direction transverse to the chemical potential gradient and is proportional to $g^{xy}$ component of the emergent spacetime structure. The longitudinal conductivity contains information about the gravitational red-shift factors. Furthermore, in the absence of externally applied electric field there can be "free-fall" or zero-bias currents that can be used as detectors of terahertz radiation.</description>

      <title>BCS in the Sky: Signatures of Inflationary Fermion Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like model in the inflationary background. We show that with an axial chemical potential, the attractive quartic fermion self-interaction can lead to a BCS-like condensation. In the rigid-de Sitter (dS) limit of inflation where backreaction from the inflaton and graviton is neglected, we perform the first computation of the non-perturbative effective potential that includes the full spacetime curvature effects in the presence of the chemical potential, subject to the mean-field approximation whose validity has been checked via the Ginzburg criterion. The corresponding BCS phase transition is always first-order, when the varying Hubble is interpreted as an effective Gibbons-Hawking temperature of dS spacetime. In the condensed phase, the theory can be understood from UV and IR sides as fermionic and bosonic, respectively. This leads to distinctive signatures in the primordial non-Gaussianity of curvature perturbations. Namely, the oscillatory cosmological collider signal is smoothly turned off at a finite momentum ratio, since different momentum ratios effectively probe different energy scales. In addition, such BCS phase transitions can also source stochastic gravitational waves, which are feasible for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Geometric flavours of Quantum Field theory on a Cauchy hypersurface. Part I: Gaussian analysis and other Mathematical aspects</title>

Abstract: In this series of papers we aim to provide a mathematically comprehensive framework to the Hamiltonian pictures of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. Our final goal is to study the kinematics and the dynamics of the theory from the point of differential geometry in infinite dimensions.In this first part we introduce the tools of Gaussian analysis in infinite dimensional spaces of distributions. These spaces will serve the basis to understand the Schr\"odinger and Holomorphic pictures, over arbitrary Cauchy hypersurfaces, using tools of Hida-Malliavin calculus. Here the Wiener-Ito decomposition theorem provides the QFT particle interpretation. Special emphasis is done in the applications to quantization of these tools in the second part of this paper. We devote a section to introduce Hida test functions as a notion of second quantized test functions. We also analyze of the ingredients of classical field theory modeled as distributions paving the way for quantization procedures that will be analyzed in the second part of this series.</description>

      <title>Dual CFT on Nariai limit for Kerr-Sen-dS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Kerr-Sen-de Sitter black hole~(BH) in the Nariai limit where the event and cosmological horizon coincide. We show that the near-horizon Kerr-Sen-de Sitter black hole in Nariai limit is a fiber over AdS$_2$ with an appropriate coordinate transformation, instead of fiber over dS$_2$. Hence, we can compute the associated central charge and CFT temperature by using the Kerr/CFT method. It is remarkably exhibited that through Cardy's growth of states, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy on cosmological horizon is reproduced. Moreover, we show that the radial equation of the quantum scalar field in $J$- and $Q$-pictures on this charged rotating background in Nariai limit can be portrayed in quadratic Casimir operator form with $SL(2,R)\times SL(2,R)$ isometry. We also compute the corresponding thermodynamic quantities from CFT to find the absorption cross-section and real-time correlator in $J$-picture. In $Q$-picture, we do not find a well-defined CFT description. We then extend the study of quantum scalar field in Nariai limit for Kerr-Newman-dS black hole solution and show that the hidden conformal symmetry on this black hole's background in in $J$- and $Q$-pictures is well-defined.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal Kerr-like ECO in the Kerr/CFT Correspondence in Higher Spin Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kerr/CFT correspondence has been established to explore the quantum theory of gravity in the near-horizon geometry of a extreme Kerr black holes. The quantum gravitational corrections on the near-horizon region may manifest in form of a partially reflective membrane that replace the horizon. In such modification, the black holes now can be seen as a horizonless exotic compact object (ECO). In this paper, we consider the properties of Kerr-like ECOs in near-extremal condition using Kerr/CFT correspondence. We study the quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section in that background and compare these by using CFT dual computation. The corresponding dual CFT one needs to incorporate finite size/finite $N$ effects in the dual CFT terminology. We also extend the dual CFT analysis for higher spin perturbations such as photon and graviton. We find consistency between properties of the ECOs from gravity sides and from CFT sides. The quasinormal mode spectrum is in line with non-extreme case, where the differences are in the length of the circle, on which the dual CFT lives, and phase shift of the incoming perturbation. The absorption cross-section has oscillatory feature that start to disappear near extremal limit. The particle spin determines the phase shift and conformal weight. We also obtain that the echo time-delay depends on the position of the membrane and extremality of the ECOs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators Through the Looking Glass: Reality, Parity, and Factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of quantum fields during inflation, and show that the total-energy singularities appearing in the perturbative expansion of the late-time Wavefunction of the Universe are purely real when the external states are massless scalars and massless gravitons. Our proof relies on the tree-level approximation, Bunch-Davies initial conditions, and exact scale invariance (IR-convergence), but without any assumptions on invariance under de Sitter boosts. We consider all $n$-point functions and allow for the exchange of additional states of any mass and integer spin. Our proof makes use of a decomposition of the inflationary bulk-bulk propagator of massive spinning fields which preserves UV-convergence and ensures that the time-ordered contributions are purely real after we rotate to Euclidean time. We use this reality property to show that the maximally-connected parts of wavefunction coefficients, from which total-energy singularities originate, are purely real. In a theory where all states are in the complementary series, this reality extends to the full wavefunction coefficient. We then use our reality theorem to show that parity-odd correlators (correlators that are mirror asymmetric) are factorised and do not diverge when the total-energy is conserved. We pay special attention to the parity-odd four-point function (trispectrum) of inflationary curvature perturbations and use our reality/factorisation theorems to show that this observable is factorised into a product of cubic diagrams thereby enabling us to derive exact shapes. We present examples of couplings between the inflaton and massive spin-1 and spin-2 fields, with the parity-violation in the trispectrum driven by Chern-Simons corrections to the spinning field two-point function, or from parity-violating cubic interactions which we build within the Effective Field Theory of Inflation.</description>

      <title>Discovering neutron stars with LISA via measurements of orbital eccentricity in Galactic binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LISA will detect $\sim \! 10^4$ Galactic binaries, the majority being double white dwarfs. However, approximately $\sim \! 1 \textrm{--} 5 \%$ of these systems will contain neutron stars which, if they can be correctly identified, will provide new opportunities for studying binary evolution pathways involving mass reversal and supernovae as well as being promising targets for multi-messenger observations. Eccentricity, expected from neutron star natal kicks, will be a key identifying signature for binaries containing a neutron star. Eccentric binaries radiate at widely-spaced frequency harmonics that must first be identified as originating from a single source and then analysed coherently. A multi-harmonic heterodyning approach for this type of data analysis is used to perform Bayesian parameter estimation on a range of simulated eccentric LISA signals. This is used to: (i) investigate LISA's ability to measure orbital eccentricity and to quantify the minimum detectable eccentricity; (ii) demonstrate how eccentricity and periastron precession help to break the mass degeneracy allowing the individual component masses to be inferred, potentially confirming the presence of a neutron star; (iii) investigate the possibility of source misidentification when the individual harmonics of an eccentric binary masquerade as separate circular binaries; and (iv) investigate the possibility of source reclassification, where parameter estimation results of multiple circular analyses are combined in postprocessing to quickly infer the parameters of an eccentric source. The broader implications of this for the ongoing design of the LISA global fit are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Ghost Problem, Spectrum Identities and Various Constraints on Brane-localized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16297v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the brane-localized interactions, including DGP gravity and higher derivative (HD) gravity localized on the brane. We derive the effective action on the brane, which suggests the brane-localized HD gravity suffers the ghost problem generally. Besides, we obtain novel algebraic identities of the mass spectrum, which reveal the global nature and can characterize the phase transformation of the mass spectrum. We get a powerful ghost-free condition from the spectrum identities, which rules out one type of brane-localized HD gravity. We further prove the mass spectrum is real and non-negative $m^2\ge 0$ under the ghost-free condition.
  Furthermore, we discuss various constraints on parameters of brane-localized gravity in AdS/BCFT and wedge holography, respectively. They include the ghost-free condition of Kaluza-Klein and brane-bending modes, the positive definiteness of boundary central charges, and entanglement entropy. The ghost-free condition imposes strict constraint, which requires non-negative couplings for pure DGP gravity and Gauss-Bonnet gravity on the brane. It also rules out one class of brane-localized HD gravity. Thus, such HD gravity should be understood as a low-energy effective theory on the brane under the ghost energy scale. Finally, we briefly discuss the applications of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of geodynamics in a spacetime crystal based on an event wavepacket constructed from the Floquet-Bloch waves, which not only involve a scalar dispersion function but also a Berry curvature tensor in the phase space manifold of spacetime and the reciprocal quasi energy-momentum. In the presence of structural deformation, this theory is naturally extended into a covariant form with the introduction of a lattice connection constructed out of the gradients of the local lattice vectors. The geodesic equation for a free particle involves not only the lattice connection but also higher-order corrections from spacetime inhomogeneity of Berry curvatures and quasi energy-momentum dispersion.</description>

      <title>T-Minkowski noncommutative spacetimes I: Poincar\'e groups, differential calculi and braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and investigates a class of noncommutative spacetimes that I will call ``T-Minkowski,'' whose quantum Poincar\'e group of isometries exhibits unique and physically motivated characteristics. Notably, the coordinates on the Lorentz subgroup remain commutative, while the deformation is confined to the translations (hence the T in the name), which act like an integrable set of vector fields on the Lorentz group. This is similar to Majid's bicrossproduct construction, although my approach allows the description of spacetimes with commutators that include a constant matrix as well as terms that are linear in the coordinates (the resulting structure is that of a centrally-extended Lie algebra). Moreover, I require that one can define a covariant braided tensor product representation of the quantum Poincar\'e group, describing the algebra of N-points. This also implies that a 4-dimensional bicovariant differential calculus exists on the noncommutative spacetime. The resulting models can all be described in terms of a numerical triangular R-matrix through RTT relations (as well as RXX, RXY and RXdX relations for the homogeneous spacetime, the braiding and the differential calculus). The R-matrices I find are in one-to-one correspondence with the triangular r-matrices on the Poincar\'e group without quadratic terms in the Lorentz generators. These have been classified, up to automorphisms, by Zakrzewski, and amount to 16 inequivalent models. This paper is the first of a series, focusing on the identification of all the quantum Poincar\'e groups that are allowed by my assumptions, as well as the associated quantum homogeneous spacetimes, differential calculi and braiding constructions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints from the EFT power spectrum and tree-level bispectrum of 21cm intensity maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the information content of 21cm intensity maps in redshift space using the 1-loop Effective Field Theory power spectrum model and the bispectrum at tree level. The 21cm signal contains signatures of dark matter, dark energy and the growth of large-scale structure in the Universe. These signatures are typically analyzed via the 2-point correlation function or power spectrum. However, adding the information from the 3-point correlation function or bispectrum will be crucial to exploiting next-generation intensity mapping experiments. The bispectrum could offer a unique opportunity to break key parameter degeneracies that hinder the measurement of cosmological parameters and improve on the precision. We use a Fisher forecast analysis to estimate the constraining power of the HIRAX survey on cosmological parameters, dark energy and modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Topological classes of thermodynamics of the static multi-charge AdS black holes in gauged supergravities: Novel temperature-dependent thermodynamic topological phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate, in the framework of the topological approach to black hole thermodynamics, using the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy, the topological numbers of the static multi-charge AdS black holes in four- and five-dimensional gauged supergravities. We find that the topological number of the static-charged AdS black holes in four-dimensional Kaluza-Klein (K-K) gauged supergravity theory is $W = 0$, while that of the static-charged AdS black holes in four-dimensional gauged $-iX^0X^1$-supergravity and STU gauged supergravity theories, and five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) gauged supergravity and STU gauged supergravity, and five-dimensional static-charged AdS Horowitz-Sen black hole are both $W = 1$. Furthermore, we observe a novel temperature-dependent thermodynamic topological phase transition that can happen in the four-dimensional static-charged AdS black hole in EMDA gauged supergravity theory, the four-dimensional static-charged AdS Horowitz-Sen black hole, and the five-dimensional static-charged AdS black hole in K-K gauged supergravity theory. We believe that the novel temperature-dependent thermodynamic topological phase transition could help us better understand black hole thermodynamics and, further, shed new light on the fundamental nature of gauged supergravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, a Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun (BDNK) theory for linear stochastic fluctuations, which is proved to be mathematically consistent, causal, and covariantly stable. The Martin-Siggia-Rose action is shown to be bilocal in most cases, and the noise is not white. The presence of nonhydrodynamic modes induces long-range correlations in the primary fluid variables (temperature, chemical potential, and flow velocity). However, correlators of conserved densities remain localized in space, and coincide with those calculated within fluctuating Isreal-Stewart theory. We show that, in some cases, there is a nonlocal change of variables that maps the Israel-Stewart action into the BDNK action.</description>

Abstract: In this series of papers we aim to provide a mathematically comprehensive framework to the Hamiltonian pictures of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. Our final goal is to study the kinematics and the dynamics of the theory from the point of differential geometry in infinite dimensions. In this second part we use the tools of Gaussian analysis in infinite dimensional spaces introduced in the first part to describe rigorously the procedures of geometric quantization in the space of Cauchy data of a scalar theory. This leads us to discuss and establish relations between different pictures of QFT. We also apply these tools to describe the geometrization of the space of pure states of quantum field theory as a Kh\"aler manifold. We use this to derive an evolution equation that preserves the geometric structure and avoids norm losses in the evolution. This leads us to a modification of the Schr\"odinger equation via a quantum connection that we discuss and exemplify in a simple case.</description>

Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Dark Energy with a Quadratic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02000</link>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel late-time effective dark energy model characterized by a quadratic equation of state (EoS) and rigorously examine its observational constraints. Initially, we delve into the background dynamics of this model, tracing the evolution of fluctuations in linear order. Our approach involves substituting the conventional cosmological constant with a dynamically effective dark energy fluid. Leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets encompassing the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and a prior on the Hubble constant $H_0$ (R21), we constrain the model parameters. We establish the model's consistency by comparing the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift against observational Hubble data (OHD), benchmarking its performance against the Standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, our investigation delves into studies of the model's dynamical behavior by computing cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, relative Hubble parameter, and the evolution of the Hubble rate. Furthermore, employing Bayesian analysis, we determine the Bayesian Evidence for our proposed model compared to the reference $\Lambda$CDM model. While our analysis unveils the favorable behavior of the model in various observational tests, the well-known cosmological tensions persist when the full dataset combination is explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to encode the radiative degrees of freedom in $4$-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes, using the boundary Cotton and stress tensors. Background radiation leads to a reduction of the asymptotic symmetry group, in contrast to asymptotically flat spacetimes, where a non-vanishing news tensor does not restrict the asymptotic symmetries. Null gauges, such as $\Lambda$-BMS, provide a framework for AdS spacetimes that include radiation in the flat limit. We use this to check that the flat limit of the radiative data matches the expected definition in intrinsically asymptotically flat spacetimes. We further dimensionally reduce our construction to the celestial sphere, and show how the $2$-dimensional celestial currents can be extracted from the $3$-dimensional boundary data.</description>

      <title>Defining the type IIB matrix model without breaking Lorentz symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory, which may elucidate the emergence of (3+1)-dimensional space-time. However, the partition function is divergent due to the Lorentz symmetry, which is represented by a noncompact group. This divergence has been regularized conventionally by introducing some infrared cutoff, which breaks the Lorentz symmetry. Here we point out that Lorentz invariant observables become classical as one removes the infrared cutoff and that this "classicalization" is actually an artifact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking cutoff. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a natural way to "gauge-fix" the Lorentz symmetry in a fully nonperturbative manner. This also enables us to perform numerical simulations in such a way that the time-evolution can be extracted directly from the matrix configurations.</description>

      <title>Probing de Sitter Space Using CFT States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>
