      <title>A Practical Guide to Rigorously Locate Periodic Orbits in Discrete Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic orbits are important objects of discrete dynamical systems, but finding them is not always easy. We present a self-contained introductory account, aimed at non-experts, to prove their existence and study their stability using the aid of the computer. The method consists in three main steps. First, we reformulate the problem of identifying a $p$-periodic orbit as a root-finding problem. Second, we find a numerical approximation of the root (i.e. a periodic orbit candidate). Third, we verify rigorously the contraction of a quasi-Newton operator near this approximation, which guarantees the existence of a unique root (i.e. periodic orbit). The neighbourhood of contraction is a ball centered at the approximation, whose radius yields a rigorous a posteriori error bound on the numerical approximation.
  To illustrate the effectiveness of this method, we implement it in two examples: the well-known logistic map and a discretization of a predator prey model. For the logistic map, we prove the existence of more than $80\cdot 10^2$ periodic orbits of periods $p=1,\ldots , 80$, mostly unstable. For the predator-prey model, we rigorously detect over $80\cdot 10^4$ periodic orbits of periods $p=1,\ldots, 10$, mostly unstable as well. This confirms well-known dynamical features such as period-doubling bifurcations and the emergence of increasingly complex orbit structures as the parameter changes.</description>

      <title>Two irrationally elliptic closed orbits of Reeb flows on the boundary of star-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two long-standing conjectures in Hamiltonian dynamics concerning Reeb flows on the boundaries of star-shaped domains in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ ($n \geq 2$). One conjecture states that such a Reeb flow possesses either $n$ or infinitely many prime closed orbits; the other states that all the closed Reeb orbits are irrationally elliptic when the domain is convex and the flow possesses finitely many prime closed orbits. In this paper, we prove that for dynamically convex Reeb flow on the boundary of a star-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ ($n \geq 2$) with exactly $n$ prime closed orbits, at least two of them must be irrationally elliptic.</description>

      <title>Functional Equations for Generalized Collatz Dynamics Using Integral Representations and Residue Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a wide class of Collatz-type arithmetic dynamics, and presents a systematic derivation of recursive formulas and functional equations satisfied by the associated generating functions. The main tools belong to complex analysis, including contour-integral representations, residue calculus, and Cauchy's integral formulas. The basic approach is inspired by Egorychev's method, which has been used so far to establish combinatorial identities. Moreover, this work generalizes existing results and extends the methodology to multiple dimensions using several complex variables.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Coupled Cell Systems with High-dimensional Internal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of network dynamics is oftentimes restricted to networks with one-dimensional internal dynamics. Here, we show how symmetry explains the relation between behavior of systems with one-dimensional internal dynamics and with higher dimensional internal dynamics, when the network topology is the same. Fundamental networks of homogeneous coupled cell systems (B. Rink, J. Sanders. Coupled Cell Networks and Their Hidden Symmetries. SIAM J. Math. Anal. 46.2 (2014)) can be expressed in terms of monoid representations, which uniquely decompose into indecomposable subrepresentations. In the high-dimensional internal dynamics case, these subrepresentations are isomorphic to multiple copies of those one computes in the one-dimensional case. We describe the implications of this observation on steady state and Hopf bifurcations in $l$-parameter families of network vector fields. The main results are that (1) generic one-parameter steady state bifurcations are qualitatively independent of the dimension of the internal dynamics and that, (2) in order to observe all generic $l$-parameter bifurcations that may occur for internal dynamics of any dimension, the internal dynamics has to be at least $l$-dimensional for steady state bifurcations and $2l$-dimensional for Hopf bifurcations. Furthermore, we illustrate how additional structure in the network can be exploited to obtain understanding beyond qualitative statements about the collective dynamics. One-parameter steady state bifurcations in feedforward networks exhibit an unusual amplification in the asymptotic growth rates of individual cells, when these are one-dimensional (S. von der Gracht, E. Nijholt, B. Rink. Amplified steady state bifurcations in feedforward networks. Nonlinearity 35.4 (2022)). We prove that (3) the same cells exhibit this amplifying effect with the same growth rates when the internal dynamics is high-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems Models for Market Evolution: A Mechanistic Alternative to Autoregressive Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to modeling market dynamics using ordinary differential equations that explicitly incorporates product competitiveness and consumer behavior. Our framework treats market segments as interacting populations in a dynamical system analogous to predator-prey models, where competitive advantages drive market share transitions through mechanistic modeling of market flows including new product adoption, refresh cycles, and obsolescence dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for a class of semilinear Moore-Gibson-Thompson equations with subcritical nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of higher-order semilinear evolution equations inspired by the Moore-Gibson-Thompson model introduced by Dell'Oro, Liverani and Pata (2023), involving strongly elliptic operators of order ($2m$) with homogeneous boundary conditions. The associated unbounded linear operator is a sectorial operator with zero belonging to the resolvent set, allowing the construction of fractional powers spaces, and the analysis of their spectral properties. We prove the local well-posedness of the corresponding semilinear Cauchy problem under subcritical nonlinearities. Our framework clarifies the role of extrapolation spaces and fractional domains in handling the lack of accretivity and bounded imaginary powers of the operator.</description>

      <title>Two-scale branching functions and inhomogeneous attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a two-scale branching function associated with an arbitrary metric space, which encodes the lower and upper box dimensions as well as the Assouad spectrum. If the metric space is quasi-doubling, this function is approximately Lipschitz. We fully classify the attainable Lipschitz two-scale branching functions, which gives a new proof of the classification of Assouad spectra due to the second author.
  We then study inhomogeneous self-conformal sets satisfying standard separation conditions. We show that the two-scale branching function of the attractor is given explicitly in terms of the two-scale branching function of the condensation set and the Hausdorff dimension of the homogeneous attractor. In particular, this gives formulas for the lower box dimension and the Assouad spectrum of the attractor.</description>

      <title>Disconnected large bifurcation supports and Cartesian products of bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bifurcation that occurs in a multiparameter family is a Cartesian product if it splits into two factors in the sense that one bifurcation takes place in one part of the phase portrait, another one -- in another part, and they are in a sense independent, do not interact with each other. To understand how a family bifurcates, it is sufficient to study it in a neighborhood of the so-called large bifurcation support. Given a family of vector fields on $S^2$ that unfolds a field $v_0$, the respective large bifurcation support is a closed $v_0$-invariant subset of the sphere indicating parts of the phase portrait of $v_0$ affected by bifurcations. One should consider disconnected large bifurcation supports in order to obtain Cartesian products for sure. We prove that, if the large bifurcation support is disconnected and the restriction of the original family to some neighborhood of each connected component is structurally stable (plus some mild extra conditions), then the original family is a Cartesian product of the bifurcations that occur near the components of the large bifurcation support. We also show that the structural stability requirement cannot be omitted.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian neural ODEs: Measuring the existence of a Lagrangian with Helmholtz metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Integrated Guidance and Control for Leader-Follower Flexible Formation of Fixed Wing UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear integrated guidance and control (IGC) approach for flexible leader-follower formation flight of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while accounting for high-fidelity aerodynamics and thrust dynamics. Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the follower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain range and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and its line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the prescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a hemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly maps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the follower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control surface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control subsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based backstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set, where Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's bearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability analysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict constraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The proposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation mismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by transitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set when the leader aggressively maneuvers. The proposed IGC law relies only on relative information and onboard sensors without the information about the leader's maneuver, making it suitable for GPS-denied or non-cooperative scenarios. Finally, we present simulation results to vindicate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Max-min energy of pseudoholomorphic curves and periodic Reeb flows in dimension $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we make use of elementary spectral invariants given by the max-min energy of pseudoholomorphic curves, recently defined by Michael Hutchings, to study periodic $3$-dimensional Reeb flows. We prove that Zoll contact forms on $S^3$ are characterized by $c_1 = c_2 = \mathcal{A}_{\min}$. This follows from the spectral gap closing bound property and a computation of ECH spectral invariants for Zoll contact forms defined on Lens spaces $L(p,1)$ for $p\geq 1$. The former characterization fails for Lens spaces $L(p,1)$ with $p&gt;1$. Nevertheless, we characterize Zoll contact forms on $L(p,1)$ in terms of ECH spectral invariants. Lastly, we note a characterization of Besse contact forms also holds for elementary spectral invariants analogously to the one obtained by Dan Cristofaro-Gardiner and Mazzucchelli.</description>

      <title>Subcritical transition and multistability in liquid metal magnetoconvection with sidewalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motionless conducting state of liquid metal convection with an applied vertical magnetic field confined in a vessel with insulating side walls becomes linearly unstable to wall modes through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Nevertheless, we show that the transition proceeds subcritically, with stable finite-amplitude solutions with different symmetries existing at parameter values beneath this linear stability threshold. Under increased thermal driving, the branch born from the linear instability becomes unstable and solutions are attracted to the most subcritical branch, which follows a quasiperiodic route to chaos. Thus, we show that the transition to turbulence is controlled by this subcritical branch and hence, turbulent solutions have no connection to the initial linear instability. This is further quantified by observing that the subcritical equilibrium solution sets the spatial symmetry of the turbulent mean flow and thus, organises large-scale structures in the turbulent regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of feedback Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a mean-field Ising model whose coupling depends on the magnetization via a linear feedback function. A key feature of this linear feedback Ising model (FIM) is the possibility of temperature-induced bistability, where a temperature increase can favor bistability between two phases. We show that the linear FIM provides a minimal model for a transcritical bifurcation as the temperature varies. Moreover, there can be two or three critical temperatures when the external magnetic field is non-negative. In the bistable region, we identify a Maxwell temperature where the two phases are equally probable, and we find that increasing the temperature favors the lower phase. We show that the probability distribution becomes non-Gaussian on certain time intervals when the magnetization converges algebraically at either zero temperature or critical temperatures. Near critical points in the parameter space, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation, construct the families of equilibrium distributions, and formulate scaling laws for transition rates between two stable equilibria. The linear FIM provides considerable freedom to control steady-state bifurcations and their associated equilibrium distributions, which can be desirable for modeling feedback systems across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Rotation number and dynamics of 3-interval piecewise $\lambda$-affine contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of piecewise contractions admitting a rotation number and defined for every $x\in[0,1)$ by $f(x)=\lambda x + \delta + d \theta_a(x) \pmod 1$, where $\lambda\in(0,1)$, $d\in(0,1-\lambda)$, $\delta\in[0,1]$, $a\in[0,1]$ and $\theta_a(x)=1$ if $x\geq a$ and $\theta_a(x)=0$ otherwise. In the special case where $a=1$, the family reduces to the well studied ``contracted rotations" $x\mapsto \lambda x + \delta \pmod 1$, which are 2-interval piecewise $\lambda$-affine contractions when $\delta\in(1-\lambda,1)$. Considering $a\in(0,1)$ allows maps with an additional discontinuity, that is, $3$-interval piecewise $\lambda$-affine contractions. Supposing $\lambda$ and $d$ fixed, for any $\rho\in(0,1)$ and $\alpha\in[0,1]$, we provide the values of the parameters $\delta$ and $a$ for which the corresponding map has rotation number $\rho$, and a symbolic dynamics containing that of the rotation $R_\rho:[0,1)\to[0,1)$ of angle $\rho$ with respect to the partition given by the positions of $1-\rho$ and $\alpha$ in $[0,1)$. This enables in particular to determine the maps that have a given number of periodic orbits of an arbitrary period, or a Cantor set attractor supporting a dynamics of a given complexity.</description>

      <title>Topological Kleene Field Theories as a model of computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the foundations of a computational field theory, which we term Topological Kleene Field Theory (TKFT), inspired by Stephen Kleene's seminal work on partial recursive functions and drawing parallels with Topological Field Theory. Our central result shows that any computable function can be simulated by the flow on a smooth bordism of a vector field with good local properties, setting an alternative model of computation to Turing machines. We thus establish that a computable function can be fully realized within a single go of a dynamical system, differing from previous works where computation is encoded as an iterative process. The output of the computable function emerges directly, laying the groundwork for potential applications that accelerate the physical realization of computation.</description>

      <title>Projection theorems with countably many exceptions and applications to the exact overlaps conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish several optimal estimates for exceptional parameters in the projection of fractal measures: (1) For a parametric family of self-similar measures satisfying a transversality condition, the set of parameters leading to a dimension drop is at most countable. (2) For any ergodic CP-distribution $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$, the Hausdorff dimension of its orthogonal projection is $\min\{1, \dim Q\}$ in all but at most countably many directions. Applications of our projection results include: (i) For any planar Borel probability measure with uniform entropy dimension $\alpha$, the packing dimension of its orthogonal projection is at least $\min\{1, \alpha\}$ in all but at most countably many directions. (ii) For any planar set $F$, the Assouad dimension of its orthogonal projection is at least $ \min\{1, \dim_{\rm A} F\} $ in all but at most countably many directions.</description>

      <title>Transitive Anosov flows on non-compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study topological transitivity of Anosov flows on non-compact 3-manifolds. We provide homological conditions under which the lifts of a transitive Anosov flow to certain infinite covers of the manifold remain transitive. With some deep results in 3-manifold topology, we then deduce that such cover can be obtained for any non-graph manifold admitting a transitive Anosov flow. Moreover, for a large class of Anosov flows known as $\mathbb{R}$-covered, which are always transitive, we show that their lifts to any regular covers are either transitive or consist exclusively of wandering orbits. Finally, we construct a family of transitive Anosov flows on non-compact manifolds that satisfy a homotopical characterization of suspension flows, answering the flow version of a question concerning the existence of transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms on non-compact manifolds.</description>

      <title>Switching, Multiple Time-Scales and Geometric Blow-Up in a Low-Dimensional Gene Regulatory Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ODE-based models for gene regulatory networks (GRNs) can often be formulated as smooth singular perturbation problems with multiple small parameters, some of which are related to time-scale separation, whereas others are related to 'switching' (proximity to a non-smooth singular limit). This motivates the study of reduced models obtained after (i) quasi-steady state reduction (QSSR), which utilises the time-scale separation, and (ii) piecewise-smooth approximations, which reduce the nonlinearity of the model by viewing highly nonlinear sigmoidal terms as singular perturbations of step functions. We investigate the interplay between the reduction methods (i)-(ii), in the context of a 4-dimensional GRN which has been used as a low-dimensional representative of an important class of (generally high-dimensional) GRN models in the literature. We begin by identifying a region in the small parameter plane for which this problem can be formulated as a smooth singularly perturbed system on a blown-up space, uniformly in the switching parameter. This allows us to apply Fenichel's coordinate-free theorems and obtain a rigorous reduction to a 2-dimensional system, that is a perturbation of the QSSR. Finally, we show that the reduced system features a Hopf bifurcation which does not appear in the QSSR system, due to the influence of higher order terms. Taken together, our findings suggest that the relative size of the small parameters is important for the validity of QSS reductions and the determination of qualitative dynamics in GRN models more generally. Although the focus is on the 4-dimensional GRN, our approach is applicable to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the cardinality of measures of maximal relative entropy for smooth skew products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ and $M$ be compact smooth manifolds and let $\Theta:\Omega\times M\to\Omega\times M$ be a $\mathcal C^{1+\alpha}$ skew-product diffeomorphism over an Axiom A base. We show that $\Theta$ has at most countably many ergodic hyperbolic measures of maximal relative entropy. When $\dim M=2$, if $\Theta$ has positive relative topological entropy, then $\Theta$ has at most countably many ergodic measures of maximal relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Integrable measure equivalence rigidity of right-angled Artin groups via quasi-isometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a right-angled Artin group with $|\mathrm{Out}(G)|&lt;+\infty$. We prove that if a countable group $H$ with bounded torsion is measure equivalent to $G$, with an $L^1$-integrable measure equivalence cocycle towards $G$, then $H$ is finitely generated and quasi-isometric to $G$. In particular, through work of Kleiner and the second-named author, $H$ acts properly and cocompactly on a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ cube complex which is quasi-isometric to $G$ and equivariantly projects to the right-angled building of $G$.
  As a consequence of work of the second-named author, we derive a superrigidity theorem in integrable measure equivalence for an infinite class of right-angled Artin groups, including those whose defining graph is an $n$-gon with $n\ge 5$. In contrast, we also prove that if a right-angled Artin group $G$ with $|\mathrm{Out}(G)|&lt;+\infty$ splits non-trivially as a product, then there does not exist any locally compact group which contains all groups $H$ that are $L^1$-measure equivalent to $G$ as lattices, even up to replacing $H$ by a finite-index subgroup and taking the quotient by a finite normal subgroup.</description>

      <title>Regular Pairings for Non-quadratic Lyapunov Functions and Contraction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on stability and contractivity have highlighted the importance of semi-inner products, which we refer to as pairings,
  associated with general norms. A pairing is a binary operation that relates the derivative of a curve's norm to the radius-vector of the
  curve and its tangent. This relationship, known as the curve norm derivative formula, is crucial when using the norm as a Lyapunov
  function. Another important property of the pairing, used in stability and contraction criteria, is the so-called Lumer inequality, which
  relates the pairing to the induced logarithmic norm. We prove that the curve norm derivative formula and Lumer's inequality are, in fact,
  equivalent to each other and to several simpler properties. We then introduce and characterize regular pairings that satisfy all of
  these properties. Our results unify several independent theories of pairings (semi-inner products) developed in previous work on functional
  analysis and control theory. Additionally, we introduce the polyhedral max pairing and develop computational tools for polyhedral norms,
  advancing contraction theory in non-Euclidean spaces.</description>
