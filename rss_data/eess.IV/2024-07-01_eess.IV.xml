Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive disease that primarily affects the arterial walls. It is one of the major causes of cardiovascular disease. Magnetic Resonance (MR) black-blood vessel wall imaging (BB-VWI) offers crucial insights into vascular disease diagnosis by clearly visualizing vascular structures. However, the complex anatomy of the neck poses challenges in distinguishing the carotid artery (CA) from surrounding structures, especially with changes like atherosclerosis. In order to address these issues, we propose GAPNet, which is a consisting of a novel geometric prior deduced from.</description>

      <title>High-resolution segmentations of the hypothalamus and its subregions for training of segmentation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly relevant neuroimaging topic, as it is a prerequisite for different analyses such as volumetry or shape analysis. Automated segmentation facilitates the study of brain structures in larger cohorts when compared with manual segmentation, which is time-consuming. However, the development of most automated methods relies on large and manually annotated datasets, which limits the generalizability of these methods. Recently, new techniques using synthetic images have emerged, reducing the need for manual annotation. Here we provide HELM, Hypothalamic ex vivo Label Maps, a dataset composed of label maps built from publicly available ultra-high resolution ex vivo MRI from 10 whole hemispheres, which can be used to develop segmentation methods using synthetic data. The label maps are obtained with a combination of manual labels for the hypothalamic regions and automated segmentations for the rest of the brain, and mirrored to simulate entire brains. We also provide the pre-processed ex vivo scans, as this dataset can support future projects to include other structures after these are manually segmented.</description>

      <title>BOrg: A Brain Organoid-Based Mitosis Dataset for Automatic Analysis of Brain Diseases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have enabled the study of human brain development using brain organoids derived from stem cells. Quantifying cellular processes like mitosis in these organoids offers insights into neurodevelopmental disorders, but the manual analysis is time-consuming, and existing datasets lack specific details for brain organoid studies. We introduce BOrg, a dataset designed to study mitotic events in the embryonic development of the brain using confocal microscopy images of brain organoids. BOrg utilizes an efficient annotation pipeline with sparse point annotations and techniques that minimize expert effort, overcoming limitations of standard deep learning approaches on sparse data. We adapt and benchmark state-of-the-art object detection and cell counting models on BOrg for detecting and analyzing mitotic cells across prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase stages. Our results demonstrate these adapted models significantly improve mitosis analysis efficiency and accuracy for brain organoid research compared to existing methods. BOrg facilitates the development of automated tools to quantify statistics like mitosis rates, aiding mechanistic studies of neurodevelopmental processes and disorders.

      <title>Robustness Testing of Black-Box Models Against CT Degradation Through Test-Time Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation and object detection are becoming increasingly available as clinical products. However, as details are rarely provided about the training data, models may unexpectedly fail when cases differ from those in the training distribution. An approach allowing potential users to independently test the robustness of a model, treating it as a black box and using only a few cases from their own site, is key for adoption. To address this, a method to test the robustness of these models against CT image quality variation is presented. In this work we present this framework by demonstrating that given the same training data, the model architecture and data pre processing greatly affect the robustness of several frequently used segmentation and object detection methods to simulated CT imaging artifacts and degradation. Our framework also addresses the concern about the sustainability of deep learning models in clinical use, by considering future shifts in image quality due to scanner deterioration or imaging protocol changes which are not reflected in a limited local test dataset.</description>

      <title>Deep Temporal Sequence Classification and Mathematical Modeling for Cell Tracking in Dense 3D Microscopy Videos of Bacterial Biofilms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic cell tracking in dense environments is plagued by inaccurate correspondences and misidentification of parent-offspring relationships. In this paper, we introduce a novel cell tracking algorithm named DenseTrack, which integrates deep learning with mathematical model-based strategies to effectively establish correspondences between consecutive frames and detect cell division events in crowded scenarios. We formulate the cell tracking problem as a deep learning-based temporal sequence classification task followed by solving a constrained one-to-one matching optimization problem exploiting the classifier's confidence scores. Additionally, we present an eigendecomposition-based cell division detection strategy that leverages knowledge of cellular geometry. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated by tracking densely packed cells in 3D time-lapse image sequences of bacterial biofilm development. The experimental results on simulated as well as experimental fluorescence image sequences suggest that the proposed tracking method achieves superior performance in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluation measures compared to recent state-of-the-art cell tracking approaches.</description>

      <title>AstMatch: Adversarial Self-training Consistency Framework for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has shown considerable potential in medical image segmentation, primarily leveraging consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. However, many SSL approaches only pay attention to low-level consistency and overlook the significance of pseudo-label reliability. Therefore, in this work, we propose an adversarial self-training consistency framework (AstMatch). Firstly, we design an adversarial consistency regularization (ACR) approach to enhance knowledge transfer and strengthen prediction consistency under varying perturbation intensities. Second, we apply a feature matching loss for adversarial training to incorporate high-level consistency regularization. Additionally, we present the pyramid channel attention (PCA) and efficient channel and spatial attention (ECSA) modules to improve the discriminator's performance. Finally, we propose an adaptive self-training (AST) approach to ensure the pseudo-labels' quality. The proposed AstMatch has been extensively evaluated with cutting-edge SSL methods on three public-available datasets. The experimental results under different labeled ratios indicate that AstMatch outperforms other existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/GuanghaoZhu663/AstMatch.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Radiological Diagnosis: A Collaborative Approach Integrating AI and Human Expertise for Visual Miss Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-AI collaboration to identify and correct perceptual errors in chest radiographs has not been previously explored. This study aimed to develop a collaborative AI system, CoRaX, which integrates eye gaze data and radiology reports to enhance diagnostic accuracy in chest radiology by pinpointing perceptual errors and refining the decision-making process. Using public datasets REFLACX and EGD-CXR, the study retrospectively developed CoRaX, employing a large multimodal model to analyze image embeddings, eye gaze data, and radiology reports. The system's effectiveness was evaluated based on its referral-making process, the quality of referrals, and performance in collaborative diagnostic settings. CoRaX was tested on a simulated error dataset of 271 samples with 28% (93 of 332) missed abnormalities. The system corrected 21% (71 of 332) of these errors, leaving 7% (22 of 312) unresolved. The Referral-Usefulness score, indicating the accuracy of predicted regions for all true referrals, was 0.63 (95% CI 0.59, 0.68). The Total-Usefulness score, reflecting the diagnostic accuracy of CoRaX's interactions with radiologists, showed that 84% (237 of 280) of these interactions had a score above 0.40. In conclusion, CoRaX efficiently collaborates with radiologists to address perceptual errors across various abnormalities, with potential applications in the education and training of novice radiologists.</description>

      <title>SPIRONet: Spatial-Frequency Learning and Topological Channel Interaction Network for Vessel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic vessel segmentation is paramount for developing next-generation interventional navigation systems. However, current approaches suffer from suboptimal segmentation performances due to significant challenges in intraoperative images (i.e., low signal-to-noise ratio, small or slender vessels, and strong interference). In this paper, a novel spatial-frequency learning and topological channel interaction network (SPIRONet) is proposed to address the above issues. Specifically, dual encoders are utilized to comprehensively capture local spatial and global frequency vessel features. Then, a cross-attention fusion module is introduced to effectively fuse spatial and frequency features, thereby enhancing feature discriminability. Furthermore, a topological channel interaction module is designed to filter out task-irrelevant responses based on graph neural networks. Extensive experimental results on several challenging datasets (CADSA, CAXF, DCA1, and XCAD) demonstrate state-of-the-art performances of our method. Moreover, the inference speed of SPIRONet is 21 FPS with a 512x512 input size, surpassing clinical real-time requirements (6~12FPS). These promising outcomes indicate SPIRONet's potential for integration into vascular interventional navigation systems. Code is available at https://github.com/Dxhuang-CASIA/SPIRONet.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Generative Replay for Task-Incremental Segmentation with Concurrent Appearance and Semantic Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalist segmentation models are increasingly favored for diverse tasks involving various objects from different image sources. Task-Incremental Learning (TIL) offers a privacy-preserving training paradigm using tasks arriving sequentially, instead of gathering them due to strict data sharing policies. However, the task evolution can span a wide scope that involves shifts in both image appearance and segmentation semantics with intricate correlation, causing concurrent appearance and semantic forgetting. To solve this issue, we propose a Comprehensive Generative Replay (CGR) framework that restores appearance and semantic knowledge by synthesizing image-mask pairs to mimic past task data, which focuses on two aspects: modeling image-mask correspondence and promoting scalability for diverse tasks. Specifically, we introduce a novel Bayesian Joint Diffusion (BJD) model for high-quality synthesis of image-mask pairs with their correspondence explicitly preserved by conditional denoising. Furthermore, we develop a Task-Oriented Adapter (TOA) that recalibrates prompt embeddings to modulate the diffusion model, making the data synthesis compatible with different tasks. Experiments on incremental tasks (cardiac, fundus and prostate segmentation) show its clear advantage for alleviating concurrent appearance and semantic forgetting.

      <title>Deep Unfolding-Aided Parameter Tuning for Plug-and-Play Based Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures high-dimensional data efficiently by compressing it into two-dimensional observations and reconstructing high-dimensional data from two-dimensional observations with various algorithms. Plug-and-play (PnP) is a promising approach for the video SCI reconstruction because it can leverage both the observation model and denoising methods for videos. This paper proposes a deep unfolding-based method for tuning noise level parameters in PnP-based video SCI, which significantly affects the reconstruction accuracy. For the training of the parameters, we prepare training data from the densely annotated video segmentation (DAVIS) dataset, reparametrize the noise level parameters, and apply the checkpointing technique to reduce the required memory. Simulation results show that the trained noise level parameters significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy and exhibit a non-monotonic pattern, which is different from the assumptions in the conventional convergence analyses of PnP-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Impact of Initialization on Intra-subject Pediatric Brain MR Image Registration: A Comparative Analysis between SyN ANTs and Deep Learning-Based Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of conventional SyN ANTs and learning-based registration methods in the context of pediatric neuroimaging, specifically focusing on intrasubject deformable registration. The comparison involves three approaches: without (NR), with rigid (RR), and with rigid and affine (RAR) initializations. In addition to initialization, performances are evaluated in terms of accuracy, speed, and the impact of age intervals and sex per pair. Data consists of the publicly available MRI scans from the Calgary Preschool dataset, which includes 63 children aged 2-7 years, allowing for 431 registration pairs. We implemented the unsupervised DL framework with a U-Net architecture using DeepReg and it was 5-fold cross-validated. Evaluation includes Dice scores for tissue segmentation from 18 smaller regions obtained by SynthSeg, analysis of log Jacobian determinants, and registration pro-rated training and inference times. Learning-based approaches, with or without linear initializations, exhibit slight superiority over SyN ANTs in terms of Dice scores. Indeed, DL-based implementations with RR and RAR initializations significantly outperform SyN ANTs. Both SyN ANTs and DL-based registration involve parameter optimization, but the choice between these methods depends on the scale of registration: network-based for broader coverage or SyN ANTs for specific structures. Both methods face challenges with larger age intervals due to greater growth changes. The main takeaway is that while DL-based methods show promise with faster and more accurate registrations, SyN ANTs remains robust and generalizable without the need for extensive training, highlighting the importance of method selection based on specific registration needs in the pediatric context.

      <title>Malaria Cell Detection Using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malaria remains one of the most pressing public health concerns globally, causing significant morbidity and mortality, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and disease management. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic examination of blood smears, are labor-intensive and require significant expertise, which may not be readily available in resource-limited settings. This project aims to automate the detection of malaria-infected cells using a deep learning approach. We employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the ResNet50 architecture, leveraging transfer learning to enhance performance. The Malaria Cell Images Dataset from Kaggle, containing 27,558 images categorized into infected and uninfected cells, was used for training and evaluation. Our model demonstrated high accuracy, precision, and recall, indicating its potential as a reliable tool for assisting in malaria diagnosis. Additionally, a web application was developed using Streamlit to allow users to upload cell images and receive predictions about malaria infection, making the technology accessible and user-friendly. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the methodology, experiments, and results, highlighting the effectiveness of deep learning in medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Cost-efficient Active Illumination Camera For Hyper-spectral Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyper-spectral imaging has recently gained increasing attention for use in different applications, including agricultural investigation, ground tracking, remote sensing and many other. However, the high cost, large physical size and complicated operation process stop hyperspectral cameras from being employed for various applications and research fields. In this paper, we introduce a cost-efficient, compact and easy to use active illumination camera that may benefit many applications. We developed a fully functional prototype of such camera. With the hope of helping with agricultural research, we tested our camera for plant root imaging. In addition, a U-Net model for spectral reconstruction was trained by using a reference hyperspectral camera's data as ground truth and our camera's data as input. We demonstrated our camera's ability to obtain additional information over a typical RGB camera. In addition, the ability to reconstruct hyperspectral data from multi-spectral input makes our device compatible to models and algorithms developed for hyperspectral applications with no modifications required.</description>

      <title>CSAKD: Knowledge Distillation with Cross Self-Attention for Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging, capturing detailed spectral information for each pixel, is pivotal in diverse scientific and industrial applications. Yet, the acquisition of high-resolution (HR) hyperspectral images (HSIs) often needs to be addressed due to the hardware limitations of existing imaging systems. A prevalent workaround involves capturing both a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) and a low-resolution (LR) HSI, subsequently fusing them to yield the desired HR-HSI. Although deep learning-based methods have shown promising in HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion and LR-HSI super-resolution (SR), their substantial model complexities hinder deployment on resource-constrained imaging devices. This paper introduces a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework for HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion to achieve SR of LR-HSI. Our KD framework integrates the proposed Cross-Layer Residual Aggregation (CLRA) block to enhance efficiency for constructing Dual Two-Streamed (DTS) network structure, designed to extract joint and distinct features from LR-HSI and HR-MSI simultaneously. To fully exploit the spatial and spectral feature representations of LR-HSI and HR-MSI, we propose a novel Cross Self-Attention (CSA) fusion module to adaptively fuse those features to improve the spatial and spectral quality of the reconstructed HR-HSI. Finally, the proposed KD-based joint loss function is employed to co-train the teacher and student networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the student model not only achieves comparable or superior LR-HSI SR performance but also significantly reduces the model-size and computational requirements. This marks a substantial advancement over existing state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/ming053l/CSAKD.</description>

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) has been used worldwide as a non-invasive test to assist in diagnosis. However, the ionizing nature of X-ray exposure raises concerns about potential health risks such as cancer. The desire for lower radiation doses has driven researchers to improve reconstruction quality. Although previous studies on low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) denoising have demonstrated the effectiveness of learning-based methods, most were developed on the simulated data. However, the real-world scenario differs significantly from the simulation domain, especially when using the multi-slice spiral scanner geometry. This paper proposes a two-stage method for the commercially available multi-slice spiral CT scanners that better exploits the complete reconstruction pipeline for LDCT denoising across different domains. Our approach makes good use of the high redundancy of multi-slice projections and the volumetric reconstructions while leveraging the over-smoothing problem in conventional cascaded frameworks caused by aggressive denoising. The dedicated design also provides a more explicit interpretation of the data flow. Extensive experiments on various datasets showed that the proposed method could remove up to 70\% of noise without compromised spatial resolution, and subjective evaluations by two experienced radiologists further supported its superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Deformable MRI Sequence Registration for AI-based Prostate Cancer Diagnosis</title>

Abstract: The PI-CAI (Prostate Imaging: Cancer AI) challenge led to expert-level diagnostic algorithms for clinically significant prostate cancer detection. The algorithms receive biparametric MRI scans as input, which consist of T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted scans. These scans can be misaligned due to multiple factors in the scanning process. Image registration can alleviate this issue by predicting the deformation between the sequences. We investigate the effect of image registration on the diagnostic performance of AI-based prostate cancer diagnosis. First, the image registration algorithm, developed in MeVisLab, is analyzed using a dataset with paired lesion annotations. Second, the effect on diagnosis is evaluated by comparing case-level cancer diagnosis performance between using the original dataset, rigidly aligned diffusion-weighted scans, or deformably aligned diffusion-weighted scans. Rigid registration showed no improvement. Deformable registration demonstrated a substantial improvement in lesion overlap (+10% median Dice score) and a positive yet non-significant improvement in diagnostic performance (+0.3% AUROC, p=0.18). Our investigation shows that a substantial improvement in lesion alignment does not directly lead to a significant improvement in diagnostic performance. Qualitative analysis indicated that jointly developing image registration methods and diagnostic AI algorithms could enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Epicardium Prompt-guided Real-time Cardiac Ultrasound Frame-to-volume Registration</title>

Abstract: A comprehensive guidance view for cardiac interventional surgery can be provided by the real-time fusion of the intraoperative 2D images and preoperative 3D volume based on the ultrasound frame-to-volume registration. However, cardiac ultrasound images are characterized by a low signal-to-noise ratio and small differences between adjacent frames, coupled with significant dimension variations between 2D frames and 3D volumes to be registered, resulting in real-time and accurate cardiac ultrasound frame-to-volume registration being a very challenging task. This paper introduces a lightweight end-to-end Cardiac Ultrasound frame-to-volume Registration network, termed CU-Reg. Specifically, the proposed model leverages epicardium prompt-guided anatomical clues to reinforce the interaction of 2D sparse and 3D dense features, followed by a voxel-wise local-global aggregation of enhanced features, thereby boosting the cross-dimensional matching effectiveness of low-quality ultrasound modalities. We further embed an inter-frame discriminative regularization term within the hybrid supervised learning to increase the distinction between adjacent slices in the same ultrasound volume to ensure registration stability. Experimental results on the reprocessed CAMUS dataset demonstrate that our CU-Reg surpasses existing methods in terms of registration accuracy and efficiency, meeting the guidance requirements of clinical cardiac interventional surgery.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised variational autoencoder for cell feature extraction in multiplexed immunofluorescence images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in digital imaging technologies have sparked increased interest in using multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) images to visualise and identify the interactions between specific immunophenotypes with the tumour microenvironment at the cellular level. Current state-of-the-art multiplexed immunofluorescence image analysis pipelines depend on cell feature representations characterised by morphological and stain intensity-based metrics generated using simple statistical and machine learning-based tools. However, these methods are not capable of generating complex representations of cells. We propose a deep learning-based cell feature extraction model using a variational autoencoder with supervision using a latent subspace to extract cell features in mIF images. We perform cell phenotype classification using a cohort of more than 44,000 multiplexed immunofluorescence cell image patches extracted across 1,093 tissue microarray cores of breast cancer patients, to demonstrate the success of our model against current and alternative methods.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Knowledge Distillation for Lightweight Skin Cancer Classification: Balancing Accuracy and Computational Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skin cancer is a major concern to public health, accounting for one-third of the reported cancers. If not detected early, the cancer has the potential for severe consequences. Recognizing the critical need for effective skin cancer classification, we address the limitations of existing models, which are often too large to deploy in areas with limited computational resources. In response, we present a knowledge distillation based approach for creating a lightweight yet high-performing classifier. The proposed solution involves fusing three models, namely ResNet152V2, ConvNeXtBase, and ViT Base, to create an effective teacher model. The teacher model is then employed to guide a lightweight student model of size 2.03 MB. This student model is further compressed to 469.77 KB using 16-bit quantization, enabling smooth incorporation into edge devices. With six-stage image preprocessing, data augmentation, and a rigorous ablation study, the model achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.75% on the HAM10000 dataset and 98.94% on the Kaggle dataset in classifying benign and malignant skin cancers. With its high accuracy and compact size, our model appears to be a potential choice for accurate skin cancer classification, particularly in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>LiverUSRecon: Automatic 3D Reconstruction and Volumetry of the Liver with a Few Partial Ultrasound Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction of the liver for volumetry is important for qualitative analysis and disease diagnosis. Liver volumetry using ultrasound (US) scans, although advantageous due to less acquisition time and safety, is challenging due to the inherent noisiness in US scans, blurry boundaries, and partial liver visibility. We address these challenges by using the segmentation masks of a few incomplete sagittal-plane US scans of the liver in conjunction with a statistical shape model (SSM) built using a set of CT scans of the liver. We compute the shape parameters needed to warp this canonical SSM to fit the US scans through a parametric regression network. The resulting 3D liver reconstruction is accurate and leads to automatic liver volume calculation. We evaluate the accuracy of the estimated liver volumes with respect to CT segmentation volumes using RMSE. Our volume computation is statistically much closer to the volume estimated using CT scans than the volume computed using Childs' method by radiologists: p-value of 0.094 (&gt;0.05) says that there is no significant difference between CT segmentation volumes and ours in contrast to Childs' method. We validate our method using investigations (ablation studies) on the US image resolution, the number of CT scans used for SSM, the number of principal components, and the number of input US scans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic liver volumetry system using a few incomplete US scans given a set of CT scans of livers for SSM.</description>
