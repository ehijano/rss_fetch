      <title>Edgeworth expansion on Wiener chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $F$ an element of the $p$-th Wiener chaos $\WW_p$, and denote by $\prob_F$ its law. For a positive integer $m$, let $\boldsymbol{\gamma}_{F,m}$ be the Radon measure with density $x \mapsto \frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left(1 + \sum_{k=3}^{4m-1} \frac{\E[H_k(F)]}{k!}\, H_k(x)\right)$, where $H_k$ is the $k$-th Hermite polynomial. The main goal of this article is to prove that the total variation distance between $\prob_F$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}_{F,m}$ is of order $\Var(\Gamma(F,F))^{({m+1})/{2}}$, where $\Gamma(F,F)$ denotes the carr\'e-du-champ operator of $F$. The variance of $\Gamma(F,F)$ is known to govern Gaussian fluctuations and can be bounded from above by $\kappa_4(F)$, the fourth cumulant of $F$, as established in the seminal work \cite{NP2009a}. Our result thus provides a genuine Edgeworth expansion in the setting of central convergence on Wiener chaoses. In this context, the quantity $\Var(\Gamma(F,F))$ plays the role of the small parameter that governs the accuracy of the approximation, in the same way that $1/\sqrt{n}$ does in the classical central limit theorem. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to establish Edgeworth expansions for Wiener chaoses in full generality and at arbitrary order, together with explicit remainder bounds that systematically improve with the order of the expansion--exactly as one would expect from an Edgeworth approximation. Our results apply verbatim to every situation where a central limit theorem is available for chaos elements, since no structural assumption is required beyond belonging to a fixed Wiener chaos. As a byproduct, we recover the celebrated optimal fourth moment theorem from \cite{NP2015} by combining the expansions at the first and second orders, with sharper quantitative bounds. Previous works on Edgeworth expansions for Wiener chaoses were essentially restricted to the first order.</description>

      <title>Stein's method for Fr\'echet approximation: a regularly varying functions approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a variant of Stein's method of comparison of generators
  to bound the Kolmogorov, total variation, and Wasserstein-1
  distances between distributions on the real line. Our discrepancy is
  expressed in terms of the ratio of reverse hazard rates; it
  therefore remains tractable even when density derivatives are
  intractable. Our main application concerns the approximation of
  normalized extremes by Fr\'echet laws. In this setting, the new
  discrepancy provides a quantitative measure of distributional
  proximity in terms of the average regular variation at infinity of
  the underlying cumulative distribution function. We illustrate the
  approach through explicit computations for maxima of Pareto, Cauchy,
  and Burr~XII distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to prove the celebrated Discrete Renewal Theorem in a common special case. We use only very elementary methods from real analysis, rather than markov chain theory, complex analysis, or generating functions. Provided is an introduction to a 1d discrete renewal process via a board game example, our proof the discrete renewal theorem, as well as background and history of the Erd\v{o}s-Feller-Pollard Theorem.</description>

      <title>Higher order return times for $\phi$-mixing measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider $\phi$-mixing measures and show that the limiting return times distribution is compound Poisson distribution as the target sets shrink to a zero measure set. The approach we use generalises a method given by Galves and Schmitt in 1997 for the first entry time to higher orders.</description>

      <title>Multiscaling asymptotic behavior of solutions to random high-order heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies high-order partial differential equations with random initial conditions that have both long-memory and cyclic behavior. The cases of random initial conditions with the spectral singularities, both at zero (representing classical long-range dependence) and at non-zero frequencies (representing cyclic long-range dependence), are investigated.
  Using spectral methods and scaling techniques, it is proved that, after proper rescaling and normalization, the solutions converge to Gaussian random fields. For each type of equation, spectral representations and covariance functions of limit fields are given. For odd-order equations, we apply the kernel averaging of solutions to obtain nonexplosive and nondegenerate limits. It is shown that the different limit fields are determined by the even or odd orders of the equations and by the presence or absence of a spectral singularity at zero. Several numeric examples illustrate the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Finite Markov chains and Monte-Carlo Methods: An Undergraduate Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a free textbook suitable for a one-semester course on Markov chains, covering basics of finite-state chains, many classical models, asymptotic behavior and mixing times, Monte Carlo methods, and martingales and harmonic functions. It is designed to fill a gap in the literature by being suitable for undergraduates; much of the theory is thus built from the ground up, with only basic probability and linear algebra assumed. We take as our basic framework the first four chapters of the classic Levin-Peres text "Markov Chains and Mixing Times," generously expanding to make an exposition suitable for an undergraduate audience. We also incorporate over a hundred exercises and problems, along with a rich set of accompanying illustrations. Suggested homework sets are found in an appendix.
  Updated editions will periodically appear as new versions of this submission.</description>

      <title>Multi-solitons to focusing mass-supercritical stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation driven by linear multiplicative noise in the mass-supercritical case. Given arbitrary $K$ solitary waves with distinct speeds, we construct stochastic multi-solitons pathwisely in the sense of controlled rough path, which behave asymptotically as the sum of the $K$ prescribed solitons as time tends to infinity. In contrast to the mass-(sub)critical case in \cite{RSZ23}, the linearized Schr\"odinger operator around the ground state has more unstable directions in the supercritical case. Our pathwise construction utilizes the rescaling approach and the modulation method in \cite{CMM11}. We derive the quantitative decay rates dictated by the noise for the unstable directions, as well as the modulation parameters and remainder in the geometrical decomposition. They are important to close the key bootstrap estimates and to implement topological arguments to control the unstable directions. As a result, the temporal convergence rate of stochastic multi-solitons, which can be of either exponential or polynomial type, is related closely to the spatial decay rate of the noise and reflects the noise impact on soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Jump Processes with Self-Interactions: Large Deviation Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a pure jump process $\{X_t\}_{t\ge 0}$ with values in a finite state space $S= \{1, \ldots, d\}$ for which the jump rates at time instant $t$ depend on the occupation measure $L_t \doteq t^{-1} \int_0^t \delta_{X_s}\,ds$. Such self-interacting chains arise in many contexts within statistical physics and applied probability. Under appropriate conditions, a large deviation principle is established for the pair $(L_t, R_t)$, as $t \to \infty$, where $R_t$ is the empirical flux process associated with the jump process. We show that the rate function takes a simple form that can be viewed as a dynamical generalization of the classical Donsker and Varadhan rate function for the analogous quantities in the setting of Markov processes, in particular, unlike the Markovian case, the rate function is not convex. Since the state process is non-Markovian, different techniques are needed than in the setting of Donsker and Varadhan and our proofs rely on variational representations for functionals of Poisson random measures and stochastic control methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the percolation threshold of finitary random interlacements in four and higher dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp asymptotic bounds for the critical intensity of the Finitary Random Interlacements (FRI) model in four and higher dimensions with general trajectory length distributions. Our proof reveals that the construction of near-critical FRI clusters in four and higher dimensions is essentially analogous to a Galton-Watson process, whose expected number of offspring corresponds to the capacity of a random walk killed at the given length.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the level-set percolation of the discrete Gaussian free field (GFF) on regular trees in the critical regime, initiated in arXiv:2302.02753. First, we derive a sharp asymptotic estimate for the probability that the connected component of the critical level set containing the root of the tree reaches generation $n$. In particular, we show that the one-arm exponent satisfies $\rho =1$. Next, we establish a Yaglom-type limit theorem for the values of the GFF at generation $n$ within this component. Finally, we show that, after a correct rescaling, this component conditioned on reaching generation $n$ converges, as $n\to\infty$, to Aldous' continuum random tree.</description>

      <title>DeepMartingale: Duality of the Optimal Stopping Problem with Expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a martingale representation, we introduce a novel deep-learning approach, which we call DeepMartingale, to study the duality of discrete-monitoring optimal stopping problems in continuous time. This approach provides a tight upper bound for the primal value function, even in high-dimensional settings. We prove that the upper bound derived from DeepMartingale converges under very mild assumptions. Even more importantly, we establish the expressivity of DeepMartingale: it approximates the true value function within any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ under our architectural design of neural networks whose size is bounded by $\tilde{c}\,D^{\tilde{q}}\varepsilon^{-\tilde{r}}$, where the constants $\tilde{c}, \tilde{q}, \tilde{r}$ are independent of the dimension $D$ and the accuracy $\varepsilon$. This guarantees that DeepMartingale does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Numerical experiments demonstrate the practical effectiveness of DeepMartingale, confirming its convergence, expressivity, and stability.</description>

      <title>The Maker-Breaker directed triangle game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate Maker-Breaker directed triangle games -- a directionally constrained variant of the classical Maker-Breaker triangle game. Our board of interest is a tournament, and the winning sets constitute all directed triangles ($3$-cycles) present in the tournament. We begin by studying the Maker-Breaker directed triangle game played on a specially defined tournament called the parity tournament, and we identify the board size threshold to be $n=7$, which is to say that if the size (i.e.\ the number of vertices) of the parity tournament equals $n$, Breaker has a winning strategy for $3\leq n&lt; 7$, while Maker can ensure a win for herself for $n\geq 7$. For the $(1:b)$ biased version of this game, we prove that the bias threshold $b^*(n)$ satisfies $\sqrt{\left(1/12+o(1)\right)\ n}\leq b^{*}(n) \leq\sqrt{\left(8/3+o(1)\right)\ n}$, which matches the order of magnitude (\ $\sqrt{n}$) of the bias threshold for the undirected counterpart of this game. Next, we consider the game on random tournaments $T(n,p)$ with labeled vertices $1,2,\ldots,n$, such that the edge between $i$ and $j$, for each $i&lt;j$, is directed from $i$ towards $j$ with probability $p$, independent of all else. We prove that Maker wins this game with probability approaching $1$ as $n \to \infty$ for any fixed $p \in (0,1)$. Extending the notion of `bias' from undirected games to our directed framework, we introduce the $(1: \kappa(n))$ flip-biased Maker-Breaker directed triangle game on the parity tournament, where we allow Breaker to strategically flip the directions of a fixed number of edges $\kappa(n)$ before the game begins. We show that the flip-bias threshold $\kappa^*(n)$ is asymptotically equal to $n^2/4$ as $n \to \infty$. This work opens up the possibility of studying a variety of directionally constrained Maker-Breaker positional games on tournaments (and more generally, on directed graphs).</description>

      <title>Minimum Hellinger Distance Estimators for Complex Survey Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable inference from complex survey samples can be derailed by outliers and high-leverage observations induced by unequal inclusion probabilities and calibration. We develop a minimum Hellinger distance estimator (MHDE) for parametric superpopulation models under complex designs, including Poisson PPS and fixed-size SRS/PPS without replacement, with possibly stochastic post-stratified or calibrated weights. Using a Horvitz-Thompson-adjusted kernel density plug-in, we show: (i) $L^1$-consistency of the KDE with explicit large-deviation tail bounds driven by a variance-adaptive effective sample size; (ii) uniform exponential bounds for the Hellinger affinity that yield MHDE consistency under mild identifiability; (iii) an asymptotic Normal distribution for the MHDE with covariance $\mathbf A^{-1}\boldsymbol\Sigma \mathbf A^{\intercal}$ (and a finite-population correction under without-replacement designs); and (iv) robustness via the influence function and $\alpha$-influence curves in the Hellinger topology. Simulations under Gamma and lognormal superpopulation models quantify efficiency-robustness trade-offs relative to weighted MLE under independent and high-leverage contamination. An application to NHANES 2021-2023 total water consumption shows that the MHDE remains stable despite extreme responses that markedly bias the MLE. The estimator is simple to implement via quadrature over a fixed grid and is extensible to other divergence families.</description>

      <title>Exact Dynamics of Multi-class Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for analyzing the training and learning rate dynamics on a variety of high- dimensional optimization problems trained using one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with data generated from multiple anisotropic classes. We give exact expressions for a large class of functions of the limiting dynamics, including the risk and the overlap with the true signal, in terms of a deterministic solution to a system of ODEs. We extend the existing theory of high-dimensional SGD dynamics to Gaussian-mixture data and a large (growing with the parameter size) number of classes. We then investigate in detail the effect of the anisotropic structure of the covariance of the data in the problems of binary logistic regression and least square loss. We study three cases: isotropic covariances, data covariance matrices with a large fraction of zero eigenvalues (denoted as the zero-one model), and covariance matrices with spectra following a power-law distribution. We show that there exists a structural phase transition. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the zero-one model and the power-law model with sufficiently large power, SGD tends to align more closely with values of the class mean that are projected onto the "clean directions" (i.e., directions of smaller variance). This is supported by both numerical simulations and analytical studies, which show the exact asymptotic behavior of the loss in the high-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Regret-Queue Length Tradeoff in Online Learning for Two-Sided Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret, $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$ maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast learning and maintaining small queue lengths.</description>

      <title>Stability and Heavy-traffic Delay Optimality of General Load Balancing Policies in Heterogeneous Service Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a load balancing system consisting of $n$ single-server queues working in parallel, with heterogeneous service rates. Jobs arrive to a central dispatcher, which has to dispatch them to one of the queues immediately upon arrival. For this setting, we consider a broad family of policies where the dispatcher can only access the queue lengths sporadically, every $T$ units of time. We assume that the dispatching decisions are made based only on the order of the scaled queue lengths at the last time that the queues were accessed, and on the processing rate of each server. For these general policies, we provide easily verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the system, and sufficient conditions for heavy-traffic delay optimality. We also show that, in heavy-traffic, the queue length converges in distribution to a scaled deterministic vector, where the scaling factor is an exponential random variable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider expanding systems with invariant measures that are uniformly expanding everywhere except on a small measure set and show that the limiting statistics of hitting times for zero measure sets are compound Poisson provided the limits for the cluster size distributions exist. This extends previous results from neighbourhoods around single points to neighbourhoods around zero measure sets. The assumptions require the correlations to decay at least polynomially and the non-uniformly expanding part of the iterates of the map also has to satisfy some decay condition. We also require some regularity conditions around the limiting zero measure target set.</description>

      <title>Structured Random Phase Retrieval using Optical Diffusers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is a nonlinear inverse problem that arises in a wide range of imaging modalities, from electron microscopy to optical Fourier ptychography. Among various modalities, random phase retrieval stands out thanks to its strong theoretical guarantees and efficient reconstruction algorithms, although its applicability is hindered by prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we propose the structured random models for phase retrieval, where we emulate a dense random matrix by a cascade of structured transforms and random diagonal matrices. We demonstrate that structured random models can achieve the same reconstruction performance as dense random models, with complexity reduced from quadratic to log-linear. Using a spectral method initialization followed by gradient descent, robust reconstruction is obtained at an oversampling ratio as low as 2.8. Moreover, we observe that the reconstruction performance is solely determined by the singular value distribution of the forward matrix. This class of models can directly be implemented with basic optical elements such as lenses and diffusers, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging with robust reconstruction guarantees.</description>

      <title>Balls and Bins and the Infinite Process with Random Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an infinite balls-into-bins process with deletions where in each discrete step $t$ a coin is tossed as to whether, with probability $\beta(t) \in (0,1)$, a new ball is allocated using the Greedy[2] strategy (which places the ball in the lower loaded of two bins sampled uniformly at random) or, with remaining probability $1-\beta(t)$, a ball is deleted from a non-empty bin chosen uniformly at random. Let $n$ be the number of bins and $m(t)$ the total load at time $t$. We are interested in bounding the discrepancy $x_{\max}(t) - m(t)/n$ (current maximum load relative to current average) and the overload $x_{\max}(t) - m_{\max}(t)/n$ (current maximum load relative to highest average observed so far).
  We prove that at an arbitrarily chosen time $t$ the total number of balls above the average is $O(n)$ and that the discrepancy is $ O(\log(n))$. For the discrepancy, we provide a matching lower bound. Furthermore we prove that at an arbitrarily chosen time $t$ the overload is $\log\log(n)+O(1)$. For "good" insertion probability sequences (in which the average load of time intervals with polynomial length increases in expectation) we show that even the discrepancy is bounded by $\log\log(n)+O(1)$.
  One of our main analytical tools is a layered induction, as per [ABKU99]. Since our model allows for rather more general scenarios than what was previously considered, the formal analysis requires some extra ingredients as well, in particular a detailed potential analysis. Furthermore, we simplify the setup by applying probabilistic couplings to obtain certain "recovery" properties, which eliminate much of the need for intricate and careful conditioning elsewhere in the analysis.</description>

Abstract: The Robbins-Monro algorithm is a recursive, simulation-based stochastic procedure to approximate the zeros of a function that can be written as an expectation. It is known that under some technical assumptions, a Gaussian convergence can be established for the procedure. Here, we are interested in the local limit theorem, that is, quantifying this convergence on the density of the involved objects. The analysis relies on a parametrix technique for Markov chains converging to diffusions, where the drift is unbounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.05605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The method of 'coupling from the past' permits exact sampling from the invariant distribution of a Markov chain on a finite state space. The coupling is successful whenever the stochastic dynamics are such that there is coalescence of all trajectories. The issue of the coalescence or non-coalescence of trajectories of a finite state space Markov chain is investigated in this note. The notion of the 'coalescence number' $k(\mu)$ of a Markovian coupling $\mu$ is introduced, and results are presented concerning the set $K(P)$ of coalescence numbers of couplings corresponding to a given transition matrix $P$. Note: This is a revision of the original published version, in which part of Theorem 6 has been removed. A correction may be found in Thm 5.3 of arXiv:2510.13572.</description>

Abstract: We investigate three types of Internal Diffusion Limited Aggregation (IDLA) models. These models are based on simple random walks on $\mathbf{Z}^2$ with infinitely many sources that are the points of the vertical axis $I(\infty)=\{0\}\times\mathbf{Z}$. Various properties are provided, such as stationarity, mixing, stabilization and shape theorems. Our results allow us to define a new directed (w.r.t. the horizontal direction) random forest spanning $\mathbf{Z}^2$, based on an IDLA protocol, which is invariant in distribution w.r.t. vertical translations.</description>

Abstract: We build and study a recursive algorithm based on the occupation measure of an Euler scheme with decreasing step for the numerical approximation of the quasistationary distribution (QSD) of an elliptic diffusion in a bounded domain. We prove the almost sure convergence of the procedure for a family of redistributions and show that we can also recover the approximation of the rate of survival and the convergence in distribution of the algorithm. This last point follows from some new bounds on the weak error related to diffusion dynamics with renewal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss equivalent formulations of the control of conditional processes introduced by Lions. In this problem, a controlled diffusion process is killed once it hits the boundary of a given domain and the controller's reward is computed based on the conditional distribution given the process's survival. So far there is no clarity regarding the relationship between the open- and closed-loop formulation of this nonstandard control problem. We provide a short proof of their equivalence using measurable selection and mimicking arguments. In addition, we link the closed-loop formulation to Fleming--Viot dynamics of McKean--Vlasov type, where upon being killed the diffusion process is reinserted into the domain according to the current law of the process itself. This connection offers a new interpretation of the control problem and opens it up to applications that feature costs caused by reinsertion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random planar quadrangulation process is introduced as an approximation for certain cellular automata in terms of random growth of rays from a given set of points. This model turns out to be a particular (rectangular) case of the well-known Gilbert tessellation, which originally models the growth of needle-shaped crystals from the initial random points with a Poisson distribution in a plane. From each point the lines grow on both sides of vertical and horizontal directions until they meet another line. This process results in a rectangular tessellation of the plane. The central and still open question is the distribution of the length of line segments in this tessellation. We derive exponential bounds for the tail of this distribution. The correlations between the segments are proved to decay exponentially with the distance between their initial points. Furthermore, the sign of the correlation is investigated for some instructive examples. In the case when the initial set of points is confined in a box $[0,N]^2$, it is proved that the average number of rays reaching the border of the box has a linear order in $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tournaments are competitions between a number of teams, the outcome of which determines the relative strength or rank of each team. In many cases, the strength of a team in the tournament is given by a score. Perhaps, the most striking mathematical result on the tournament is Moon's theorem, which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a feasible score sequence via majorization. To give a probabilistic interpretation of Moon's result, Aldous and Kolesnik introduced the football model, the existence of which gives a short proof of Moon's theorem. However, the existence proof of Aldous and Kolesnik is nonconstructive, leading to the question of a ``canonical'' construction of the football model. The purpose of this paper is to provide explicit constructions of the football model with an additional stochastic ordering constraint, which can be formulated by martingale transport. Two solutions are given: one is by solving an entropy optimization problem via Sinkhorn's algorithm, and the other relies on the idea of shadow couplings. It turns out that both constructions yield the property of strong stochastic transitivity. The nontransitive situations of the football model are also considered.</description>

      <title>From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player-funded stochastic-differential games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the spectral theory of unimodular random graphs and graphings representing them. We prove that Bernoulli graphings are relatively Ramanujan with respect to their skeleton Markov chain. That is, the part of their spectrum that comes from the random labels falls within the appropriate Alon-Boppana bound. This result complements an example due to Fr\k{a}czyk of an ergodic unimodular random graph with almost sure spectral gap but non-expanding Bernoulli graphing.
  We also highlight connections of our work with the theory of finite random graphs. Exploiting the result of Bordenave and Collins on random lifts being relatively almost Ramanujan, we prove a strengthening of our main theorem for unimodular quasi-transitive quasi-trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general class of two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems where the ambiguity set is constrained by fixed marginal probability laws that are not necessarily discrete. We derive primal and dual formulations of this class of problems and subsequently develop a numerical algorithm for computing approximate optimizers as well as approximate worst-case probability measures. Moreover, our algorithm computes both an upper bound and a lower bound for the optimal value of the problem, where the difference between the computed bounds provides a direct sub-optimality estimate of the computed solution. Most importantly, the sub-optimality can be controlled to be arbitrarily close to 0 by appropriately choosing the inputs of the algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we apply it to three prominent instances of two-stage DRO problems in task scheduling, multi-product assembly, and supply chain network design with edge failure. The ambiguity sets in these problem instances involve a large number of continuous or discrete marginals. The numerical results showcase that the proposed algorithm computes high-quality robust decisions along with non-conservative sub-optimality estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the positivity and causality axioms for Markov categories as properties of dilations and information flow in Markov categories, and in variations thereof for arbitrary semicartesian monoidal categories. These help us show that being a positive Markov category is merely an additional property of a symmetric monoidal category (rather than extra structure). We also characterize the positivity of representable Markov categories and prove that causality implies positivity, but not conversely. Finally, we note that positivity fails for quasi-Borel spaces and interpret this failure as a privacy property of probabilistic name generation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-Periodic Homogenization of a Class of Minimization Problems in Orlicz-Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the stochastic two-scale convergence method in the framework of Orlicz-Sobolev spaces, in order to deal with the homogenization of coupled stochastic-periodic problems in such spaces. One fundamental in this topic is the extension of compactness results for this method to the Orlicz setting. For the application, we show that the sequence of minimizers of a class of highly oscillatory minimizations problems involving integral functionals with convex and nonstandard growth integrands, converges to the minimizer of a homogenized problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of the Nonlinear Stochastic Fokker--Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker--Planck equation. This equation describes the evolution of the distribution of nonlocally interacting particles affected by a common source of noise. The system is directed by a controller that acts on the drift term with the goal of minimising a cost functional. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation, prove the existence of optimal controls, and formulate a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) that provides necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the control problem. The adjoint process arising in the SMP is characterised by a nonlocal (semi)linear backward SPDE for which we study existence and uniqueness. We also rigorously connect the control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker--Planck equation to the control of the corresponding McKean--Vlasov SDE that describes the motion of a representative particle. Our work extends existing results for the control of the Fokker--Planck equation to nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. In particular, the sufficient SMP, which we obtain by exploiting the special structure of the Fokker--Planck equation, seems to be novel even in the linear deterministic setting. We illustrate our results with an application to a model of government interventions in financial systems, supplemented by numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Testing by Betting while Borrowing and Bargaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing by betting has been a cornerstone of the game-theoretic statistics literature. In this framework, a betting score (or more generally an e-process), as opposed to a traditional p-value, is used to quantify the evidence against a null hypothesis: the higher the betting score, the more money one has made betting against the null, and thus the larger the evidence that the null is false. A key ingredient assumed throughout past works is that one cannot bet more money than one currently has. In this paper, we ask what happens if the bettor is allowed to borrow money after going bankrupt, allowing further financial flexibility in this game of hypothesis testing. We propose various definitions of (adjusted) evidence relative to the wealth borrowed, indebted, and accumulated. We also ask what happens if the bettor can "bargain", in order to obtain odds bettor than specified by the null hypothesis. The adjustment of wealth in order to serve as evidence appeals to the characterization of arbitrage, interest rates, and num\'eraire-adjusted pricing in this setting.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by $2N$ complex numbers $(\boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{c})$ where $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\in\mathbb{C}_+^N$ are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator, and $ \boldsymbol{c}\in\mathbb{C}^N\backslash \{0\}$ are the norming constants of the corresponding eigenfunctions. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues to be i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support in the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the expectation of the random measure associated to this random spectral data. Such expectation uniquely identifies, via the Zakharov-Shabat inverse spectral problem, a solution $\psi_\infty(x,t)$ of the fNLS equation. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution.
  We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>A set of master variables for the two-star random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such `master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of `large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean-field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.</description>
