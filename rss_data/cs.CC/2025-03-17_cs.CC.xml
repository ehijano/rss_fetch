      <title>PCP-free APX-Hardness of Nearest Codeword and Minimum Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give simple deterministic reductions demonstrating the NP-hardness of approximating the nearest codeword problem and minimum distance problem within arbitrary constant factors (and almost-polynomial factors assuming NP cannot be solved in quasipolynomial time). The starting point is a simple NP-hardness result without a gap, and is thus "PCP-free." Our approach is inspired by that of Bhattiprolu and Lee [BL24] who give a PCP-free randomized reduction for similar problems over the integers and the reals.
  We leverage the existence of $\varepsilon$-balanced codes to derandomize and further simplify their reduction for the case of finite fields.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Finding Subgroups of a Given Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding a subgroup of a given order in a finite group, where the group is represented by its Cayley table. We establish that this problem is NP-hard in the general case by providing a reduction from the Hamiltonian Cycle problem. Additionally, we analyze the complexity of the problem in the special case of abelian groups and present a linear-time algorithm for finding a subgroup of a given order when the input is given in the form of a Cayley table. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed the complexity of this problem under the Cayley table representation. Our results also provide insight into the computational difficulty of finding subgroup across different ways of groups representations.</description>

      <title>Limits of KV Cache Compression for Tensor Attention based Autoregressive Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in autoregressive transformers presents a significant bottleneck during inference, which restricts the context length capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While previous work analyzes the fundamental space complexity barriers in standard attention mechanism [Haris and Onak, 2025], our work generalizes the space complexity barriers result to tensor attention version. Our theoretical contributions rely on a novel reduction from communication complexity and deduce the memory lower bound for tensor-structured attention mechanisms when $d = \Omega(\log n)$. In the low dimensional regime where $d = o(\log n)$, we analyze the theoretical bounds of the space complexity as well. Overall, our work provides a theoretical foundation for us to understand the compression-expressivity tradeoff in tensor attention mechanisms and offers more perspectives in developing more memory-efficient transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Finding a Fair Scoring Function for Top-$k$ Selection: Hardness, Algorithms, and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting a subset of the $k$ "best" items from a dataset of $n$ items, based on a scoring function, is a key task in decision-making. Given the widespread use of automated decision-making software nowadays, it is important that the outcome of this process, called top-$k$ selection, is fair. Here we consider the problem of identifying a linear scoring function for top-$k$ selection that is fair. The function computes a score for each item as a weighted sum of its (numerical) attribute values. Additionally, the function must ensure that the subset selected is a faithful representative of the entire dataset for a minority or historically disadvantaged group. Existing algorithms do not scale effectively on large, high-dimensional datasets. Our theoretical analysis shows that in more than two dimensions, no algorithm is likely to achieve good scalability with respect to dataset size (i.e., a run time of $O(n\cdot \text{polylog}(n))$), and the computational complexity is likely to increase rapidly with dimensionality. However, there are exceptions for small values of $k$ and for this case we provide significantly faster algorithms. We also provide efficient practical variants of these algorithms. Our implementations of these take advantage of modern hardware (e.g., exploiting parallelism). For large values of $k$, we give an alternative algorithm that, while theoretically worse, performs better in practice. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms, which achieve speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art (SoTA).</description>

      <title>Graph Homomorphism, Monotone Classes and Bounded Pathwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent work by Johnson et al. (2022), a framework was described for the study of graph problems over classes specified by omitting each of a finite set of graphs as subgraphs. If a problem falls into the framework then its computational complexity can be described for all such graph classes, giving a dichotomy between those classes for which the problem is hard and those for which it is easy.
  In this article, we consider several variants of the homomorphism problem in relation to this framework. It is known that certain homomorphism problems, e.g. $C_5$-Colouring, do not sit in the framework. By contrast, we show that the more general problem of Graph Homomorphism does sit in the framework, with hard cases NP-complete and easy cases in P.
  We go on to consider several locally constrained variants of the homomorphism problem, namely the locally bijective, surjective and injective variants. Like $C_5$-Colouring, none of these is in the framework. However, where a bounded-degree restrictions are considered, we prove that each of these problems is in our framework, with hard cases NP-complete and easy cases in P
  Next, we give the first example of a problem in the framework such that hardness is in the polynomial hierarchy above NP. This comes from a list colouring game, realised through first-order logic as quantified constraints. We show that with the additional restriction of bounded alternation, the problem is contained in the framework. The hard cases are $\Pi_{2k}^\mathrm{P}$-complete and the easy cases are in P.
  Finally, we go on to consider an aforementioned problem from our framework, complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, under the omission in the input of not just a graph, but rather a graph $H$ annotated with the types for each vertex: existential or universal.</description>

      <title>Separating complexity classes of LCL problems on grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>
