      <title>Crystal-like thermal transport in amorphous carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport properties of amorphous carbon has attracted increasing attention due to its extreme thermal properties: It has been reported to have among the highest thermal conductivity for bulk amorphous solids up to $\sim$ 37 Wm\textsuperscript{-1}K\textsuperscript{-1}, comparable to crystalline sapphire ($\alpha$-Al\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3}). Further, large density dependence in thermal conductivity demonstrates a potential for largely tunable thermal conductivity. However, mechanism behind the high thermal conductivity and its large density dependence remains elusive due to many variables at play. In this work, we perform large-scale ($\sim$ 10\textsuperscript{5} atoms) molecular dynamics simulations utilizing a machine learning potential based on neural networks. Through spectral decomposition of thermal conductivity which enables a quantum correction to classical heat capacity, we find that propagating vibrational excitations govern thermal transport in amorphous carbon ($\sim$ 100 \% of thermal conductivity) in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that diffusive vibrational excitations dominate thermal transport in amorphous solids. Instead, this remarkable behavior resembles thermal transport in simple crystals. Moreover, our temperature dependent spectral diffusivity and velocity current correlation analyses reveal that the density dependent thermal conductivity originates from anharmonicity sensitive propagating excitations. Our work suggests a novel insight and design principle into developing mechanically hard, thermally conductive amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Tunable Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity in Magnetic Skyrmion Manipulation Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, as scalable and non-volatile spin textures, can dynamically interact with fields and currents, making them promising for unconventional computing. This paper presents a neuromorphic device based on skyrmion manipulation chambers to implement spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a mechanism for unsupervised learning in brain-inspired computing. STDP adjusts synaptic weights based on the timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes. The proposed three-chamber design encodes synaptic weight in the number of skyrmions in the center chamber, with left and right chambers for pre-synaptic and post-synaptic spikes. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the timing between applied currents across the chambers controls the final skyrmion count (weight). The device exhibits adaptability and learning capabilities by manipulating chamber parameters, mimicking Hebbian and dendritic location-based plasticity. The device's ability to maintain state post-write highlights its potential for advancing adaptable neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear classification of neural manifolds with contextual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural systems efficiently process information through distributed representations is a fundamental challenge at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning. Recent approaches analyze the statistical and geometrical attributes of neural representations as population-level mechanistic descriptors of task implementation. In particular, manifold capacity has emerged as a promising framework linking population geometry to the separability of neural manifolds. However, this metric has been limited to linear readouts. Here, we propose a theoretical framework that overcomes this limitation by leveraging contextual input information. We derive an exact formula for the context-dependent capacity that depends on manifold geometry and context correlations, and validate it on synthetic and real data. Our framework's increased expressivity captures representation untanglement in deep networks at early stages of the layer hierarchy, previously inaccessible to analysis. As context-dependent nonlinearity is ubiquitous in neural systems, our data-driven and theoretically grounded approach promises to elucidate context-dependent computation across scales, datasets, and models.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-induced mobility edges in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobility edges (ME), separating Anderson-localized states from extended states, are known to arise in the single-particle energy spectrum of certain one-dimensional lattices with aperiodic order. Dephasing and decoherence effects are widely acknowledged to spoil Anderson localization and to enhance transport, suggesting that ME and localization are unlikely to be observable in the presence of dephasing. Here it is shown that, contrary to such a wisdom, ME can be created by pure dephasing effects in quasicrystals in which all states are delocalized under coherent dynamics. Since the lifetimes of localized states induced by dephasing effects can be extremely long, rather counter-intuitively decoherence can enhance localization of excitation in the lattice. The results are illustrated by considering photonic quantum walks in synthetic mesh lattices.</description>

      <title>A replica theory for the dynamic glass transition of hardspheres with continuous polydispersity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy soft matter is often continuously polydisperse, in which the sizes or various properties of the constituent particles are distributed continuously. However, most of the microscopic theories of the glass transition focus on the monodisperse particles. Here, we developed a replica theory for the dynamic glass transition of continuously polydisperse hardspheres. We focused on the limit of infinite spatial dimension, where replica theory becomes exact. In theory, the cage size $A$, which plays the role of an order parameter, appears to depend on the particle size $\sigma$, and thus, the effective free energy, the so-called Franz-Parisi potential, is a functional of $A(\sigma)$. We applied this theory to two fundamental systems: a nearly monodisperse system and an exponential distribution system. We found that dynamic decoupling occurs in both cases; the critical particle size $\sigma^{\ast}$ emerges, and larger particles with $\sigma \geq \sigma^{\ast}$ vitrify, while smaller particles $\sigma &lt; \sigma^{\ast}$ remain mobile. Moreover, the cage size $A(\sigma)$ exhibits a critical behavior at $\sigma \simeq \sigma^{\ast}$, originating from spinodal instability of $\sigma^{\ast}$-sized particles. We discuss the implications of these results for finite dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Why Decussate? Topological Constraints on 3D Wiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many vertebrate motor and sensory systems decussate, or cross the midline to the opposite side of the body. The successful crossing of millions of axons during development requires a complex of tightly controlled regulatory processes. Because these processes have evolved in many distinct systems and organisms, it seems reasonable to presume that decussation confers a significant functional advantage. Yet if this is so, the nature of this advantage is not understood. In this article, we examine constraints imposed by topology on the ways that a three-dimensional processor and environment can be wired together in a continuous, somatotopic, way. We show that as the number of wiring connections grows, decussated arrangements become overwhelmingly more robust against wiring errors than seemingly simpler same-sided wiring schemes. These results provide a predictive approach for understanding how 3D networks must be wired if they are to be robust, and therefore have implications both for future large-scale computational networks and for complex bio-medical devices</description>

      <title>Effective medium properties of stealthy hyperuniform photonic structures using multiscale physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we employ multiscale physics-informed neural networks (MscalePINNs) for the inverse retrieval of the effective permittivity and homogenization of finite-size photonic media with stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) disordered geometries. Specifically, we show that MscalePINNs are capable of capturing the fast spatial variations of complex fields scattered by arrays of dielectric nanocylinders arranged according to isotropic SHU point patterns, thus enabling a systematic methodology to inverse retrieve their effective dielectric profiles. Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. We believe that the multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of general effective media and finite-size metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.</description>

      <title>Emergent spacetime from purely random structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental question whether a random discrete structure with the minimal number of restrictions can converge to continuous metric space. We study the geometrical properties such as the dimensionality and the curvature emerging out of the connectivity properties of uniform random graphs. In addition we introduce a simple evolution mechanism for the graph by removing one edge per a fundamental quantum of time from an initially complete graph. We show an exponential growth of the radius of the graph, that ends up in a random structure with emergent average spatial dimension $D=3$ and zero curvature $K=0$, resembling a flat 3D manifold, that could describe the observed space in our universe and some of its geometrical properties. In addition, we introduce a generalized action for graphs based on physical quantities on different subgraph structures that helps to recover the well known properties of spacetime as described in general relativity, like time dilation due to gravity. Also, we show how various quantum mechanical concepts such as generalized uncertainty principles based on the statistical fluctuations can emerge from random discrete models. Moreover, our approach leads to a unification of space and matter-energy, for which we propose a mass-energy-space equivalence that leads to a way to transform between empty space and matter-energy via the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a second-order phase transition in the six-dimensional Ising spin glass in a field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The very existence of a phase transition for spin glasses in an external magnetic field is controversial, even in high dimensions. We carry out massive simulations of the Ising spin-glass in a field, in six dimensions (which, according to classical -- but not generally accepted -- field-theoretical studies, is the upper critical dimension). We obtain results compatible with a second-order phase transition and estimate its critical exponents for the simulated lattice sizes. The detailed analysis performed by other authors of the replica symmetric Hamiltonian, under the hypothesis of critical behavior, predicts that the ratio of the renormalized coupling constants remain bounded as the correlation length grows. Our numerical results are in agreement with this expectation.</description>

Abstract: We study an XXZ spin chain at zero magnetization coupled to a collection of local harmonic baths at zero temperature. We map this system on a (1+1)D effective field theory using bosonization, where the effect of the bath is taken care of in an exact manner. We provide analytical and numerical evidence of the existence of two phases at zero temperature: a Luttinger liquid (LL) and an antiferromagnetic phase (AFM), separated by a phase transition akin to the Berezinsky--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) type. While the bath is responsible for the LL-AFM transition for subohmic baths, the LL-AFM transition for superohmic baths is due to the interactions within the spin chain.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>
