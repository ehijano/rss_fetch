      <title>Coupling 3D geodynamics and dynamic earthquake rupture: fault geometry, rheology and stresses across timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tectonic deformation crucially shapes the Earth's surface, with strain localization resulting in the formation of shear zones and faults that accommodate significant tectonic displacement. Earthquake dynamic rupture models, which provide valuable insights into earthquake mechanics and seismic ground motions, rely on initial conditions such as pre-stress states and fault geometry. However, these are often inadequately constrained due to observational limitations. To address these challenges, we develop a new method that loosely couples 3D geodynamic models to 3D dynamic rupture simulations, providing a mechanically consistent framework for earthquake analysis. Our approach does not prescribe fault geometry but derives it from the underlying lithospheric rheology and tectonic velocities using the medial axis transform. We perform three long-term geodynamics models of a strike-slip geodynamic system, each involving different continental crust rheology. We link these with nine dynamic rupture models, in which we investigate the role of varying fracture energy and plastic strain energy dissipation in the dynamic rupture behavior. These simulations suggest that for our fault, long-term rheology, and geodynamic system, a plausible critical linear slip weakening distance falls within Dc in [0.6,1.5]. Our results indicate that the long-term 3D stress field favors slip on fault segments better aligned with the regional plate motion and that minor variations in the long-term 3D stress field can strongly affect rupture dynamics, providing a physical mechanism for arresting earthquake propagation. Our geodynamically informed earthquake models highlight the need for detailed 3D fault modeling across time scales for a comprehensive understanding of earthquake mechanics.</description>

      <title>Machine learning surrogates for efficient hydrologic modeling: Insights from stochastic simulations of managed aquifer recharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process-based hydrologic models are invaluable tools for understanding the terrestrial water cycle and addressing modern water resources problems. However, many hydrologic models are computationally expensive and, depending on the resolution and scale, simulations can take on the order of hours to days to complete. While techniques such as uncertainty quantification and optimization have become valuable tools for supporting management decisions, these analyses typically require hundreds of model simulations, which are too computationally expensive to perform with a process-based hydrologic model. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid modeling workflow in which a process-based model is used to generate an initial set of simulations and a machine learning (ML) surrogate model is then trained to perform the remaining simulations required for downstream analysis. As a case study, we apply this workflow to simulations of variably saturated groundwater flow at a prospective managed aquifer recharge (MAR) site. We compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of several ML architectures, including deep convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, vision transformers, and networks with Fourier transforms. Our results demonstrate that ML surrogate models can achieve under 10% mean absolute percentage error and yield order-of-magnitude runtime savings over processed-based models. We also offer practical recommendations for training hydrologic surrogate models, including implementing data normalization to improve accuracy, using a normalized loss function to improve training stability and downsampling input features to decrease memory requirements.</description>

      <title>Landslide vulnerability analysis using frequency ratio (FR) model: a study on Bandarban district, Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study assesses landslide vulnerability in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), specifically focusing on Bandarban district in Southeast Bangladesh. By employing a multidisciplinary approach, thirteen factors influencing landslides were examined, including terrain features, land use, and environmental variables. Utilizing the FR model and integrating various datasets such as DEM, satellite images, and rainfall data, landslide susceptibility mapping was conducted. The analysis revealed that steep slopes, high elevations, specific aspects, and curvature contribute significantly to landslide susceptibility. Factors like erosion, soil saturation, drainage density, and human activities were also identified as key contributors. The study underscored the impact of land use changes and highlighted the stabilizing effect of vegetation cover. The resulting Landslide Susceptibility Map (LSM) categorized the area into five susceptibility zones. The model demonstrated a prediction accuracy of 76.47%, indicating its effectiveness in forecasting landslide occurrences. Additionally, the study identified significant changes in the study area over three decades, emphasizing the influence of human activities on slope instability. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and land-use planners, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to mitigate landslide risks and ensure community safety. Incorporating these insights into policy frameworks</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of stress perturbations from a partially-lubricated viscous gravity current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation into the dynamics of a viscous gravity current subjected to spatially-finite lubrication (i.e., a `slippery patch'). The work is motivated by grounded ice sheets flowing across patches of basal meltwater which reduce the ice-bed frictional coupling, causing perturbations enhancing ice motion, with implications for increased ice flux into the ocean and sea level rise. The flow is characterized by transitions between shear- and extension-dominated dynamics, which necessitates boundary-layer solutions at the transition points. We develop a depth-integrated analytical model of Newtonian flow which concisely reveals fundamental relationships between ice sheet geometry (thickness, surface slope, and slippery patch length) and the magnitude and spatial extent of resulting horizontal deviatoric stresses. This reduced-order analytical model shows good quantitative agreement with numerical simulations using 2-D Newtonian Stokes equations, which are further extended to the case of a non-Newtonian flow. From the reduced-order model, we rationalize that the slippery patch-induced stress perturbations are exponentially-decaying functions of distance upstream away from the patch onset. We also show that the amplitude of the perturbation scales linearly with the surface slope and patch length while the decay lengthscale scales linearly with ice thickness. These fundamental relationships have implications for the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to the inland expansion of basal meltwater presence over the coming warming decades.</description>

      <title>libEMMI_MGFD: A program of marine controlled-source electromagnetic modelling and inversion using frequency-domain multigrid solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20795v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a software package libEMMI\_MGFD for 3D frequency-domain marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) modelling and inversion. It is the first open-source C program tailored for geometrical multigrid (GMG) CSEM simulation. An volumetric anisotropic averaging scheme has been employed to compute effective medium for modelling over uniform and nonuniform grid. The computing coordinate is aligned with acquisition geometry by rotation with the azimuth and dip angles, facilitating the injection of the source and the extraction of data with arbitrary orientations. Efficient nonlinear optimization is achieved using quasi-Newton scheme assisted with bisection backtracking line search. In constructing the modularized Maxwell solver and evaluating the misfit and gradient for 3D CSEM inversion, the reverse communication technique is the key to the compaction of the software while maintaining the computational performance. A number of numeric tests demonstrate the efficiency of the modelling while preserving the solution accuracy. A 3D marine CSEM inversion example has been examined for resistivity imaging.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Precipitating Quasi-Geostrophic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient and effective modeling of complex systems, incorporating cloud physics and precipitation, is essential for accurate climate modeling and forecasting. However, simulating these systems is computationally demanding since microphysics has crucial contributions to the dynamics of moisture and precipitation. In this paper, appropriate stochastic models are developed for the phase-transition dynamics of water, focusing on the precipitating quasi-geostrophic (PQG) model as a prototype. By treating the moisture, phase transitions, and latent heat release as integral components of the system, the PQG model constitutes a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that involve Heaviside nonlinearities due to phase changes of water. Despite systematically characterizing the precipitation physics, expensive iterative algorithms are needed to find a PDE inversion at each numerical integration time step. As a crucial step toward building an effective stochastic model, a computationally efficient Markov jump process is designed to randomly simulate transitions between saturated and unsaturated states that avoids using the expensive iterative solver. The transition rates, which are deterministic, are derived from the physical fields, guaranteeing physical and statistical consistency with nature. Furthermore, to maintain the consistent spatial pattern of precipitation, the stochastic model incorporates an adaptive parameterization that automatically adjusts the transitions based on spatial information. Numerical tests show the stochastic model retains critical properties of the original PQG system while significantly reducing computational demands. It accurately captures observed precipitation patterns, including the spatial distribution and temporal variability of rainfall, alongside reproducing essential dynamic features such as potential vorticity fields and zonal mean flows.</description>

      <title>Meteoritic Tutton salt, a naturally inspired reservoir of cometary and asteroidal ammonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of benchmark data on the real minerals, native ammonium carriers in Solar System gives rise to controversial opinions on extraterrestrial ammonium reservoirs. We herein report on discovery of the first mineral carrier of meteoritic ammonium and show its relevance to the compositional and spectral characteristics of cometary and asteroidal bodies. Chemically distant from previously inferred volatile organics or ammoniated phyllosilicates, it is an aqueous metal-ammonium sulfate related to a family of so-called Tutton salts. Nickeloan boussingaultite, (NH4)2(Mg,Ni)(SO4)2 6H2O, occurs in Orgueil, a primitive carbonaceous chondrite closely related to (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu, the C-type asteroids. The available spectroscopic, chemical and mineralogical data signify that natural Tutton salts perfectly fit into the role of ammonium reservoir under conditions of cometary nuclei and carbonaceous asteroids.</description>

      <title>The role of gouge production in the seismic behavior of rough faults: A numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault zones mature through the accumulation of earthquakes and the wearing of contact asperities at multiple scales. This study examines how wear-induced gouge production affects the evolution of fault seismicity, focusing on earthquake nucleation, recurrence, and moment partitioning. Using 2D quasi-dynamic simulations integrating rate-and-state friction with Archard's law of wear, we model the space-time distribution of gouge and its effect on the critical slip distance. The study reveals a shift from single to multi-rupture nucleation, marked by increased foreshock activity. The recurrence interval undergoes two separate phases: an initial phase of steady increase followed by a secondary phase of unpredictable behavior. Finally, we observe a transition in the moment partitioning from faster to slower slip rates and a decrease in the moment released per cycle relative to the case where no gouge formation is simulated. This research sheds light on wear-driven mechanisms affecting fault slip behavior, offering valuable insights into how the evolution of gouge along a fault affects its seismic potential.</description>
