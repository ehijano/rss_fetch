      <title>OmniCustom: Sync Audio-Video Customization Via Joint Audio-Video Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing mainstream video customization methods focus on generating identity-consistent videos based on given reference images and textual prompts. Benefiting from the rapid advancement of joint audio-video generation, this paper proposes a more compelling new task: sync audio-video customization, which aims to synchronously customize both video identity and audio timbre. Specifically, given a reference image $I^{r}$ and a reference audio $A^{r}$, this novel task requires generating videos that maintain the identity of the reference image while imitating the timbre of the reference audio, with spoken content freely specifiable through user-provided textual prompts. To this end, we propose OmniCustom, a powerful DiT-based audio-video customization framework that can synthesize a video following reference image identity, audio timbre, and text prompts all at once in a zero-shot manner. Our framework is built on three key contributions. First, identity and audio timbre control are achieved through separate reference identity and audio LoRA modules that operate through self-attention layers within the base audio-video generation model. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning objective alongside the standard flow matching objective. It uses predicted flows conditioned on reference inputs as positive examples and those without reference conditions as negative examples, thereby enhancing the model ability to preserve identity and timbre. Third, we train OmniCustom on our constructed large-scale, high-quality audio-visual human dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniCustom outperforms existing methods in generating audio-video content with consistent identity and timbre fidelity.</description>

      <title>Artic: AI-oriented Real-time Communication for MLLM Video Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI Video Assistant emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) deployed in the cloud. This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, akin to chatting with a real person. However, a fundamental mismatch exists between current RTC frameworks and AI Video Assistants, stemming from the drastic shift in Quality of Experience (QoE) and more challenging networks. Measurements on our production prototype also confirm that current RTC fails, causing latency spikes and accuracy drops.
  To address these challenges, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented RTC framework for MLLM Video Assistants, exploring the shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video." Specifically, Artic proposes: (1) Response Capability-aware Adaptive Bitrate, which utilizes MLLM accuracy saturation to proactively cap bitrate, reserving bandwidth headroom to absorb future fluctuations for latency reduction; (2) Zero-overhead Context-aware Streaming, which allocates limited bitrate to regions most important for the response, maintaining accuracy even under ultra-low bitrates; and (3) Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark, the first benchmark evaluating how RTC-induced video degradation affects MLLM accuracy. Prototype experiments using real-world uplink traces show that compared with existing methods, Artic significantly improves accuracy by 15.12% and reduces latency by 135.31 ms. We will release the benchmark and codes at https://github.com/pku-netvideo/DeViBench.</description>

      <title>VineetVC: Adaptive Video Conferencing Under Severe Bandwidth Constraints Using Audio-Driven Talking-Head Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense bandwidth depletion within consumer and constrained networks has the potential to undermine the stability of real-time video conferencing: encoder rate management becomes saturated, packet loss escalates, frame rates deteriorate, and end-to-end latency significantly increases. This work delineates an adaptive conferencing system that integrates WebRTC media delivery with a supplementary audio-driven talking-head reconstruction pathway and telemetry-driven mode regulation. The system consists of a WebSocket signaling service, an optional SFU for multi-party transmission, a browser client capable of real-time WebRTC statistics extraction and CSV telemetry export, and an AI REST service that processes a reference face image and recorded audio to produce a synthesized MP4; the browser can substitute its outbound camera track with the synthesized stream with a median bandwidth of 32.80 kbps. The solution incorporates a bandwidth-mode switching strategy and a client-side mode-state logger.</description>

      <title>M6: Multi-generator, Multi-domain, Multi-lingual and cultural, Multi-genres, Multi-instrument Machine-Generated Music Detection Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-generated music (MGM) has emerged as a powerful tool with applications in music therapy, personalised editing, and creative inspiration for the music community. However, its unregulated use threatens the entertainment, education, and arts sectors by diminishing the value of high-quality human compositions. Detecting machine-generated music (MGMD) is, therefore, critical to safeguarding these domains, yet the field lacks comprehensive datasets to support meaningful progress. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{M6}, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for MGMD research. M6 is distinguished by its diversity, encompassing multiple generators, domains, languages, cultural contexts, genres, and instruments. We outline our methodology for data selection and collection, accompanied by detailed data analysis, providing all WAV form of music. Additionally, we provide baseline performance scores using foundational binary classification models, illustrating the complexity of MGMD and the significant room for improvement. By offering a robust and multifaceted resource, we aim to empower future research to develop more effective detection methods for MGM. We believe M6 will serve as a critical step toward addressing this societal challenge. The dataset and code will be freely available to support open collaboration and innovation in this field.</description>

      <title>FISHER: A Foundation Model for Multi-Modal Industrial Signal Comprehensive Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models, FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general performance gain up to 4.2%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential avenues for future work. Both FISHER and RMIS are now open-sourced.</description>
