      <title>Analysis of $M1$ capture in the $\alpha(d,\gamma)^6$Li reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An effective operator is exactly equivalent to the long-wavelength form of the $M1$ operator in transition matrix elements. It allows us to analytically and numerically analyze the $M1$ contribution to the $\alpha(d,\gamma)^6$Li reaction. Isoscalar $M1$ transitions from an initial $S$ wave are shown to be forbidden in radiative capture reactions when distortion is neglected in the initial state. A calculation in a three-body model with proton, neutron, and a structureless $\alpha$ interacting through effective forces leads to a negligible $M1$ $S$-factor at small energies. The dominant $M1$ contribution comes from transitions from an initial $S$ wave to isospin 1 components of the $^6$Li ground state. It is suggested that using this effective $M1$ operator in other models should clarify the origin of large discrepancies between $M1$ $S$-factors appearing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Nuclear molecule of heavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model of a nuclear molecule that composed of two heavy nuclei is proposed. To this aim the Hamiltonian of a dinuclear system is derived and diagonalized in the basis of bipolar spherical functions. Analytical expressions, describing excitations of highly deformed states of a nuclear molecule, are obtained. A remarkable agreement between numerical and analytical results is demonstrated at the description of roto-vibrational excitations in $^{240}$Pu at low energies. We provide the prediction for the spectrum of hyperdeformed states of the nucleus $^{232}$Th, considering it as a nuclear molecule that consists of $^{132}$Sn+$^{100}$Zr nuclei. The angular distribution of fission fragments for the nucleus $^{240}$Pu have been analyzed as well and compared with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Trace Anomaly And Bulk Viscosity in Heavy Ion Collisions From Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the far-from-equilibrium dynamics and transport properties of a relativistic massive gas obeying Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB), Bose-Einstein (BE), and Fermi-Dirac (FD) statistics undergoing a boost-invariant Bjorken expansion. We solve the relativistic Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA) using the method of moments. We focus on the time evolution of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\Theta^{\mu}{}_{\mu}$ and the bulk viscous pressure $\Pi$, which are key diagnostics of conformal-symmetry breaking in the rapidly evolving fireball created in heavy-ion collisions. We find that the non-equilibrium quantity $\Theta^{\mu}{}_{\mu}/T^{4}$ exhibits a non-monotonic time dependence, with a local maximum at early times and a pronounced dip around the characteristic relaxation time scale $\tau_{R}$. We further show that the scaled bulk pressure $\Pi/P_{0}$, where $P_{0}$ denotes the isotropic equilibrium pressure, depends sensitively on the particle statistics. In addition, increasing the initial chemical potential enhances the magnitudes of both $\Pi$ and $\Theta^{\mu}{}_{\mu}/T^{4}$. Finally, by initializing the system with random non-equilibrium configurations, we demonstrate that the evolution of the scaled bulk pressure and the pressure anisotropy converges to a common late-time solution.</description>

      <title>Universal relation between dipole polarizability of finite nuclei and neutron-star compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear equation of state, which determines the structure and properties of neutron stars, remains subject to substantial theoretical uncertainties, leading to model dependence in predicted observables. Universal relations have emerged as a powerful tool to mitigate this dependence by linking neutron star observables in a framework-independent manner. In this work, we introduce a new universal relation that \emph{bridges} finite nuclei and neutron stars through the dimensionless quantity $\zeta = \beta_{1.4}\tilde{L}^{-1}$, which couples the compactness of a $1.4~M_{\odot}$ neutron star to the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation. The relation is examined under a broad set of relativistic energy density functionals with point-coupling and meson-exchange interactions, as well as non-relativistic Skyrme functionals. We demonstrate that $\zeta$ exhibits a strong exponential correlation with the electric dipole polarizability $\alpha_D$ in finite nuclei across all considered equations of state. By exploiting experimental $\alpha_D$ data for selected neutron-rich nuclei, we constrain $\zeta$ and translate these constraints into equation-of-state-independent bounds on the neutron star radius $R_{1.4}$ and the symmetry-energy slope $L$, providing insights into the properties of neutron star matter.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscosities of gluon plasma across the transition temperature from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity ($\eta$) and bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) of the gluon plasma using lattice QCD over the range 0.76--2.25 $T_c$, extending from below the transition temperature $T_c$ across the transition region and into the deconfined phase. At each temperature, we employ three large, fine lattices, which enables controlled continuum extrapolations of the energy-momentum tensor correlators. Using gradient flow together with a recently developed blocking technique, we achieve percent level precision for these correlators, providing strong constraints for a model-based spectral analysis. Since the inversion to real-time information is intrinsically ill posed, we extract viscosities by fitting spectral functions whose ultraviolet behavior is matched to the best available perturbative result, while the infrared region is described by a Lorentzian transport peak. The dominant modeling uncertainty associated with the transport-peak width is bracketed by varying it over a physically motivated range set by thermal scales. We find that the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $\eta/s$, exhibits a minimum near the transition temperature $T_c$ and increases for $T&gt;T_c$, whereas the bulk-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $\zeta/s$, decreases monotonically over the entire temperature range studied.</description>

      <title>Axial Anomaly, entanglement and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (pion) decays controlled by axial anomaly imply the specific entanglement between photons having also the counterparts for classical electromagnetic waves. This is also a specific case of Eisnstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm-Aharonov effect. The absence of causality and non-locality in (angular) momentum conservation is manifested, being especially clear for the generalization to the case of time rather than space separation corresponds to the polarization of dileptons described by time-like pion transition formfactors which may be studied experimentally. The similar decays in external magnetic field manifest the interplay with vacuum conductivity in external magnetic field and longitudinal polarization of vector mesons observed in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic geometry in hadron resonance gas model at real and imaginary baryon chemical potential and a simple sufficient condition for quark deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic geometry of the hadron resonance gas model with (without) excluded volume effects (EVE) of baryons is investigated. The case with imaginary mu, where mu is the baryon chemical potential, is investigated as well as the one with real mu. We calculate the scalar curvature R and use the R=0 criterion to investigate the phase structure in the mu^2-T plane where T is the temperature. The curve on which R=0 continues analytically from the imaginary mu region, where the lattice QCD is feasible, to the real mu one. In the presence of EVE, there are rich phase structures in the large real mu region as well as the Roberge-Weiss like region where mu is imaginary and a singularity appears, while there is no phase structure in the large real $\mu$ region in the absence of EVE. The limitation temperature of the baryon gas is also obtained by using the baryon number fluctuation. The LQCD predicted critical point locates almost on the curve of the limitation temperature we determined. A simple sufficient condition, n_B&gt;1/(2v_B)$, is obtained for the quark deconfinement in the large real mu region, where n_B and v_B are the net baryon number density and the volume of a baryon, respectively.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel approach to isotensor $\pi\pi\pi$ scattering from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand three-body dynamics from first-principle QCD includes the study of non-resonant and resonant systems. The isospin $I=2$ system is of particular interest having no three-body resonance but featuring a resonance in a sub-channel, while also being a coupled-channel problem. In this study, we calculate the finite-volume spectrum from lattice QC at two different pion masses, map the amplitude to the infinite volume through a generalized FVU three-body quantization condition, investigate the limit of a narrow $\rho$, and compare with an effective Lagrangian prediction at leading order. Chiral extrapolations between different pion masses are performed.</description>

      <title>Proper derivation of subspace mapping from whole space mapping in boson expansion theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The norm operator method, which was recently proposed as a new formulation of the boson expansion theory (BET), is used to show that the subspace mapping is properly derived from the whole space mapping. This derivation requires the appropriate renormalization of the contribution of phonons that are not adopted as boson excitations in the subspace mapping. This was impossible with conventional BETs (which ignore these contributions), and is only made possible for the first time by the norm operator method, which treats these contributions appropriately. We also correct the confusion in the claims of conventional BETs. Namely, contrary to conventional claims, we show that when the phonon excitations not adopted as boson excitations make no contribution at all, the subspace mapping is obtained simply by discarding those excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Park operator, which had been considered effective only in the whole space mapping, is also effective in the subspace mapping. These findings provide a clear criterion for verifying the applicability of the boson expansion theory to large-amplitude collective motions and offer a new perspective on a microscopic foundation of the interacting boson model (IBM).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shell-model calculations with density-dependent interactions are performed to investigate $pf$-shell nuclei, examining the ground-state energies, low-lying spectra, and $E2$ transition probabilities. The density-dependent terms in the interaction are self-consistently determined using the shell-model wave function for the ground state. We test three density-dependent interactions adapted from density functionals of Gogny-D1S, Gogny-GT2, and M3Y-P6. The shell-model results satisfactorily agree with the experimental data. However, the Gogny-D1S and Gogny-GT2 fail to reproduce the magicity of $N=28$, while it is properly described by the M3Y-P6 functional.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking neutrino-nucleus quasielastic scattering model predictions against a missing energy profile obtained using a monoenergetic neutrino beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine three exclusive nuclear ground state shell models implemented in the NEUT neutrino event generator and benchmark them against the recent JSNS$^2$ measurement of missing energy using a monoenergetic neutrino source. The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.</description>
