      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of Riesz transforms on solvable extensions of Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=N\rtimes \mathbb{R}$, where $N$ is a Carnot group and $\mathbb{R}$ acts on $N$ via automorphic dilations. Homogeneous left-invariant sub-Laplacians on $N$ and $\mathbb{R}$ can be lifted to $G$, and their sum is a left-invariant sub-Laplacian $\Delta$ on $G$. We prove that the first-order Riesz transforms $X \Delta^{-1/2}$ are bounded on $L^p(G)$ for all $p\in(1,\infty)$, where $X$ is any horizontal left-invariant vector field on $G$. This extends a previous result by Vallarino and the first-named author, who obtained the bound for $p\in(1,2]$. The proof makes use of an operator-valued spectral multiplier theorem, recently proved by the authors, and hinges on estimates for products of modified Bessel functions and their derivatives.</description>

      <title>Range Description for an Attenuated Conical Radon Transform with Fixed Central Axis and Opening Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conical Radon transform is an integral transform that maps a given function $f$ to its integral over a conical surface. In this study, we invesgate the conical Radon transform with a fixed central axis and opening angle, considering the attenuation of radiation within the transform. Specifically, we explore the attenuated conical Radon transform. In this paper, we provide the range conditions for the attenuated conical Radon transform and its auxiliary transform. Range description of an operator is an important topic in mathematics, and it is useful for understanding the transform, completing incomplete data, improving reconstuction algorithm, correcting measurement error. The range conditions of attenuated conical Radon transforms are given in terms of the hyperbolic differential operator.</description>

      <title>A generalized Legendre duality relation and Gaussian saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the barycenter problem in optimal transportation theory, Kolesnikov--Werner recently extended the notion of the Legendre duality relation for two functions to the case for multiple functions. We further generalize the duality relation and then establish the centered Gaussian saturation property for a Blaschke--Santal\'{o} type inequality associated with it. Our approach to the understanding such a generalized Legendre duality relation is based on our earlier observation that directly links Legendre duality with the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality. More precisely, for a large family of degenerate Brascamp--Lieb data, we prove that the centered Gaussian saturation property for the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality holds true when inputs are restricted to even and log-concave functions.
  As an application to convex geometry, our result particularly confirms a special case of a conjecture of Kolesnikov and Werner about the Blaschke--Santal\'{o} inequality for multiple even functions as well as multiple symmetric convex bodies. Furthermore, in the direction of information theory and optimal transportation theory, this establishes a Talagrand type inequality for multiple even probability measures that involves the Wasserstein barycenter and generalizes the symmetric Talagrand transportation-cost inequality.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of Mandelbrot cascades -- in the context of vector-valued martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem of determining the Fourier dimension of the Mandelbrot canonical cascade measure (MCCM). This problem of significant interest was raised by Mandelbrot in 1976 and reiterated by Kahane in 1993. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Fourier dimension of the MCCM for random weights $W$ satisfying the condition $\mathbb{E}[W^t]&lt;\infty$ for all $t&gt;0$. As a corollary, we prove that the MCCM is Salem if and only if the random weight has a specific two-point distribution. In addition, we show that the MCCM is Rajchman with polynomial Fourier decay whenever the random weight satisfies $\mathbb{E}[W^{1+\delta}]&lt;\infty$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. As a consequence, we discover that, in the Biggins-Kyprianou's boundary case, the Fourier dimension of the MCCM exhibits a second order phase transition at the inverse temperature $\beta = 1/2$; we establish the upper Frostman regularity for MCCM; and we obtain a Fourier restriction estimate for MCCM.
  While the precise Fourier dimension formula seems to be a little magical in the realm of cascade theory, it turns out to be fairly natural in the context of vector-valued martingales. Indeed, the vector-valued martingales will play key roles in our new formalism of actions by multiplicative cascades on finitely additive vector measures, which is the major novelty of this paper.</description>

      <title>Variation inequalities for smartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A result by N.G. Makarov [Algebra i Analiz, 1989] states that for martingales $(M_n)$ on the torus we have the strict inequality \[ \liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{M_n}{\sum_{k=1}^n |\Delta M_k|} &gt; 0 \] on a set of Hausdorff dimension one, denoting by $\Delta M_n$ the martingale differences $ \Delta M_n = M_n - M_{n-1} $. We discuss an extension of this inequality to so-called smartingales on convex, compact subsets of $\mathbb R^d$, which are piecewise polynomial (or spline) versions of martingales. As a tool we need and prove an estimate for smartingales in the spirit of the law of the iterated logarithm.</description>

      <title>Sharp supremum and H\"older bounds for stochastic integrals indexed by a parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide sharp bounds for the supremum of countably many stochastic convolutions taking values in a 2-smooth Banach space. As a consequence, we obtain sharp bounds on the modulus of continuity of a family of stochastic integrals indexed by parameter $x\in M$, where $M$ is a metric space with finite doubling dimension. In particular, we obtain a theory of stochastic integration in H\"older spaces on arbitrary bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$. This is done by relating the (generalized) H\"older-seminorm associated with a modulus of continuity to a supremum over countably many variables, using a Kolmogorov-type chaining argument. We provide two applications of our results: first, we show long-term bounds for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, and second, we derive novel results regarding the modulus of continuity of the parabolic Anderson model.</description>

      <title>A note on the Fourier magnitude data and Sobolev embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Sobolev $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$, $s \in \mathbb{R}$, stability of the Fourier phase problem to recover $f$ from the knowledge of $|\hat{f}|$ with an additional Bessel potential $H^{t,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ a priori estimate when $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and $p \in [1,2]$. These estimates are related to the ones studied recently by Steinerberger in "On the stability of Fourier phase retrieval" J. Fourier Anal. Appl., 28(2):29, 2022. While our estimates in general are different, they share some comparable special cases and the main improvement given here is that we can remove an additional imaginary term and obtain sharper constants. We also consider these estimates for the quotient distances related to the non-uniqueness of the Fourier phase problem. Our arguments closely follow the Fourier analysis proof of the Sobolev embeddings for Bessel potential spaces with minor modifications.</description>

Abstract: For the $N$-dimensional Fourier matrix $\mathcal F_N$, we show that if $N \geq 2$, then all $2\times 2$ principal minors of $\mathcal F_N$ are nonzero if and only if $N$ is square-free. Additionally, we show that if $N &gt; 4$, then all $3\times 3$ principal minors of $\mathcal F_N$ are nonzero if and only if $N$ is square-free. Moreover, based on numerical experiments, we conjecture that if $N$ is square-free, then all principal minors of $\mathcal F_N$ are nonzero.</description>

      <title>Pre-measure spaces and pre-integration spaces in predicative Bishop-Cheng measure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bishop's measure theory (BMT) is an abstraction of the measure theory of a locally compact metric space $X$, and the use of an informal notion of a set-indexed family of complemented subsets is crucial to its predicative character. The more general Bishop-Cheng measure theory (BCMT) is a constructive version of the classical Daniell approach to measure and integration, and highly impredicative, as many of its fundamental notions, such as the integration space of $p$-integrable functions $L^p$, rely on quantification over proper classes (from the constructive point of view). In this paper we introduce the notions of a pre-measure and pre-integration space, a predicative variation of the Bishop-Cheng notion of a measure space and of an integration space, respectively. Working within Bishop Set Theory (BST), and using the theory of set-indexed families of complemented subsets and set-indexed families of real-valued partial functions within BST, we apply the implicit, predicative spirit of BMT to BCMT. As a first example, we present the pre-measure space of complemented detachable subsets of a set $X$ with the Dirac-measure, concentrated at a single point. Furthermore, we translate in our predicative framework the non-trivial, Bishop-Cheng construction of an integration space from a given measure space, showing that a pre-measure space induces the pre-integration space of simple functions associated to it. Finally, a predicative construction of the canonically integrable functions $L^1$, as the completion of an integration space, is included.</description>

      <title>Optimal backward uniqueness and polynomial stability of second order equations with unbounded damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For general second order evolution equations, we prove an optimal condition on the degree of unboundedness of the damping, that rules out finite-time extinction. We show that control estimates give energy decay rates that explicitly depend on the degree of unboundedness, and establish a dilation method to turn existing control estimates for one propagator into those for another in the functional calculus. As corollaries, we prove Schr\"odinger observability gives decay for unbounded damping, weak monotonicity in damping, and quantitative unique continuation and optimal propagation for fractional Laplacians. As applications, we establish a variety of novel and explicit energy decay results to systems with unbounded damping, including singular damping, linearised gravity water waves and Euler--Bernoulli plates.</description>
