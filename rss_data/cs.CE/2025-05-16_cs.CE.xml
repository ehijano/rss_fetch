      <title>Promise of Data-Driven Modeling and Decision Support for Precision Oncology and Theranostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, necessitating personalized treatment approaches to improve outcomes. Theranostics, combining molecular-level imaging with targeted therapy, offers potential for precision oncology but requires optimized, patient-specific care plans. This paper investigates state-of-the-art data-driven decision support applications with a reinforcement learning focus in precision oncology. We review current applications, training environments, state-space representation, performance evaluation criteria, and measurement of risk and reward, highlighting key challenges. We propose a framework integrating data-driven modeling with reinforcement learning-based decision support to optimize radiopharmaceutical therapy dosing, addressing identified challenges and setting directions for future research. The framework leverages Neural Ordinary Differential Equations and Physics-Informed Neural Networks to enhance Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic models while applying reinforcement learning algorithms to iteratively refine treatment policies based on patient-specific data.</description>

      <title>Physical regularized Hierarchical Generative Model for Metallic Glass Structural Generation and Energy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered materials such as glasses, unlike crystals, lack long range atomic order and have no periodic unit cells, yielding a high dimensional configuration space with widely varying properties. The complexity not only increases computational costs for atomistic simulations but also makes it difficult for generative AI models to deliver accurate property predictions and realistic structure generation. In this work, we introduce GlassVAE, a hierarchical graph variational autoencoder that uses graph representations to learn compact, rotation, translation, and permutation invariant embeddings of atomic configurations. The resulting structured latent space not only enables efficient generation of novel, physically plausible structures but also supports exploration of the glass energy landscape. To enforce structural realism and physical fidelity, we augment GlassVAE with two physics informed regularizers, a radial distribution function (RDF) loss that captures characteristic short and medium range ordering and an energy regression loss that reflects the broad configurational energetics. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results highlight the critical impact of these regularizers. By encoding high dimensional atomistic data into a compact latent vector and decoding it into structures with accurate energy predictions, GlassVAE provides a fast, physics aware path for modeling and designing disordered materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aerospace industry operates at the frontier of technological innovation while maintaining high standards regarding safety and reliability. In this environment, with an enormous potential for re-use and adaptation of existing solutions and methods, Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) has been applied for decades. The objective of this study is to identify and examine state-of-the-art knowledge management practices in the field of aerospace engineering. Our contributions include: 1) A SWARM-SLR of over 1,000 articles with qualitative analysis of 164 selected articles, supported by two aerospace engineering domain expert surveys. 2) A knowledge graph of over 700 knowledge-based aerospace engineering processes, software, and data, formalized in the interoperable Web Ontology Language (OWL) and mapped to Wikidata entries where possible. The knowledge graph is represented on the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), and an aerospace Wikibase, for reuse and continuation of structuring aerospace engineering knowledge exchange. 3) Our resulting intermediate and final artifacts of the knowledge synthesis, available as a Zenodo dataset. This review sets a precedent for structured, semantic-based approaches to managing aerospace engineering knowledge. By advancing these principles, research, and industry can achieve more efficient design processes, enhanced collaboration, and a stronger commitment to sustainable aviation.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Multigrid Methods Suitable for Topology Optimisation of Transient Heat Conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Space-Time MultiGrid (STMG) methods which are suitable for performing topology optimisation of transient heat conduction problems. The proposed methods use a pointwise smoother and uniform Cartesian space-time meshes. For problems with high contrast in the diffusivity, it was found that it is beneficial to define a coarsening strategy based on the geometric mean of the minimum and maximum diffusivity. However, other coarsening strategies may be better for other smoothers. Several methods of discretising the coarse levels were tested. Of these, it was best to use a method which averages the thermal resistivities on the finer levels. However, this was likely a consequence of the fact that only one spatial dimension was considered for the test problems. A second coarsening strategy was proposed which ensures spatial resolution on the coarse grids. Mixed results were found for this strategy. The proposed STMG methods were used as a solver for a one-dimensional topology optimisation problem. In this context, the adjoint problem was also solved using the STMG methods. The STMG methods were sufficiently robust for this application, since they converged during every optimisation cycle. It was found that the STMG methods also work for the adjoint problem when the prolongation operator only sends information forwards in time, even although the direction of time for the adjoint problem is backwards.</description>

      <title>Avocado Price Prediction Using a Hybrid Deep Learning Model: TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for healthy foods, agricultural product price forecasting has become increasingly important. Hass avocados, as a high-value crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization, the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance, with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods. This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.</description>

      <title>Towards Foundation Model for Chemical Reactor Modeling: Meta-Learning with Physics-Informed Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing accurate models for chemical reactors is often challenging due to the complexity of reaction kinetics and process dynamics. Traditional approaches require retraining models for each new system, limiting generalizability and efficiency. In this work, we take a step toward foundation models for chemical reactor modeling by introducing a neural network framework that generalizes across diverse reactor types and rapidly adapts to new chemical processes. Our approach leverages meta-learning to pretrain the model on a broad set of reactor dynamics, enabling efficient adaptation to unseen reactions with minimal data. To further enhance generalizability, we incorporate physics-informed fine-tuning, ensuring physically consistent adaptation to new reactor conditions. Our framework is evaluated across three integer-order fundamental reactor types - continuous stirred tank reactors, batch reactors, and plug flow reactors - demonstrating superior few-shot adaptation compared to conventional data-driven, physics-informed, and transfer learning approaches. By combining meta-learning with physics-informed adaptation, this work lays the foundation for a generalizable modeling framework, advancing the development of foundation models for chemical engineering applications.

      <title>Transforming physics-informed machine learning to convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) offers a powerful paradigm of integrating data with physical laws to address important scientific problems, such as parameter estimation, inferring hidden physics, equation discovery, and state prediction, etc. However, PIML still faces many serious optimization challenges that significantly restrict its applications. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization to overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear combination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the convexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the loss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into a sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems. This conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization algorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an adaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to mitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance. The proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with distinct types of physical prior. The results indicate that optimization problems are effectively solved in these scenarios, highlighting the potential of the framework for broad applications.</description>

      <title>RoBERTa-BiLSTM: A Context-Aware Hybrid Model for Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effectively analyzing the comments to uncover latent intentions holds immense value in making strategic decisions across various domains. However, several challenges hinder the process of sentiment analysis including the lexical diversity exhibited in comments, the presence of long dependencies within the text, encountering unknown symbols and words, and dealing with imbalanced datasets. Moreover, existing sentiment analysis tasks mostly leveraged sequential models to encode the long dependent texts and it requires longer execution time as it processes the text sequentially. In contrast, the Transformer requires less execution time due to its parallel processing nature. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning model, RoBERTa-BiLSTM, which combines the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. RoBERTa is utilized to generate meaningful word embedding vectors, while BiLSTM effectively captures the contextual semantics of long-dependent texts. The RoBERTa-BiLSTM hybrid model leverages the strengths of both sequential and Transformer models to enhance performance in sentiment analysis. We conducted experiments using datasets from IMDb, Twitter US Airline, and Sentiment140 to evaluate the proposed model against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the RoBERTa-BiLSTM model surpasses baseline models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-GRU, and RoBERTa-LSTM), achieving accuracies of 80.74%, 92.36%, and 82.25% on the Twitter US Airline, IMDb, and Sentiment140 datasets, respectively. Additionally, the model achieves F1-scores of 80.73%, 92.35%, and 82.25% on the same datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>AneuPy: An open source Python tool for creating simulation-ready geometries of abdominal aortic aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized dilatations of the abdominal aorta that can lead to life-threatening rupture if left untreated. AAAs primarily affect older individuals, with high mortality rates following rupture, so early diagnosis and risk assessment are critical. The geometrical characteristics of an AAA, such as its maximum diameter, asymmetry, and wall thickness, are extremely significant in biomechanical models for the assessment of rupture risk. Despite the growing use of computational modeling for AAA investigation, there is a notable gap in accessible, open-source software capable of generating simulation-ready geometries for biomechanical and hemodynamic simulations. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{AneuPy}, an open-source Python-based tool designed to create both idealized and patient-specific AAA geometric models. \textbf{AneuPy} is a fast and automated approach for generating aneurysm geometries from minimal input data, allowing for extensive parameter customization. By automating the creation of simulation-ready geometries for finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models, \textbf{AneuPy} can facilitate research in AAA and improve patient-specific risk prediction.</description>
