      <title>Geometrically expanding the BPS vortex of a non-canonical multi-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a non-canonical multi-field theory, we propose a mechanism of geometric expansion for Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortices. One builds the general setup adopting a non-canonical O(3)-sigma model, non-minimally coupled through an anomalous magnetic dipole interaction to a gauge and real scalar field. By embracing a hyperbolic non-canonical extension, one finds that self-dual vortex configurations undergo geometric expansion, deforming ANO-like vortices into disk-like structures, mitigating their energy, and generating concentric energy rings around the core. Furthermore, these vortices exhibit quantized magnetic flux and degenerate solutions. Finally, we highlight that the analyzed vortices carry energy below the corresponding magnetic flux while preserving a singularity at their origin.</description>

      <title>Holographic description of 4d Maxwell theories and their code-based ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a precise holographic duality between an ensemble of 4d $U(1)^g$ Maxwell theories living on a spin four-manifold $M_4$ and an Abelian BF-type 2-form gauge theory of level $N$, summed over all five-manifolds with boundary $M_4$. The elements of the boundary ensemble are Abelian gauge theories specified by self-dual symplectic codes over $Z_N$, that parameterize topological boundary conditions in the 5d TQFT. Similarly, the equivalence classes of topologies distinguished by the 5d theory are parameterized by orthogonal self-dual codes. Hence the holographic duality can be reformulated in the language of quantum stabilizer codes. This duality is closely related to the holographic relationship between ensembles of Narain conformal field theories in 2d and level-$N$ Abelian Chern-Simons theories in 3d. In both contexts, the duality extends to correlation functions. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the boundary ensemble average converges to an integral over the moduli space of the gauge couplings and, when finite, is equal to an Eisenstein series of the orthogonal group, a version of the Siegel-Weil formula that appears in the 2d/3d context. As a spinoff, we clarify the holographic relationship between the gauge group of the 4d N=4 super Yang-Mills theory and the boundary conditions of the singleton sector in the bulk.</description>

      <title>A Holographic prescription for generalized Schwinger-Keldysh contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a holographic prescription to compute real-time thermal correlators with arbitrary operator ordering. In field theory, these correlation functions are captured by a multi-fold Schwinger-Keldysh time contour. We propose a holographic dual for these contours, which generalizes the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry previously advocated in the literature. Our geometry consists of multiple AdS-black holes glued together at the future and past horizons, with matching conditions determined by unitarity and the KMS condition. As a proof of concept, we solve for a probe scalar field in this geometry and compute bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary propagators, in terms of which we evaluate the 4-point functions at tree-level. We show that in perturbation theory, the lowest-order diagrams that contribute non-trivially to the out-of-time order four-point function are exchange diagrams which explore the full four-fold geometry. Furthermore, these diagrams reduce to a simple factorized expression. We propose a conjecture on the structure of higher order observables and provide a partial proof by studying a subset of the contributing diagrams.</description>

      <title>Blackish Holes with Stringy Backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that an $\textit{ad hoc}$ Dirichlet boundary condition, placed outside but close to an event horizon, for probe degrees of freedom in an otherwise black hole geometry is capable of capturing non-trivial level-correlations of the corresponding spectrum of the probe sector. Much of the interesting physics stems from a hierarchy of scales that is present in the quantum spectrum, in terms of two quantum numbers that characterize it. In this work, we establish an explicit connection with the hierarchy of these scales with a $\textit{radial localization}$ or the absence of it of the probe scalar WKB-wavefunction. Subsequently, this scale separation can be traced back to the hierarchy between the local red-shift and the classical light-traversing time in a geometry that produces a Rindler-throat. The classical null ray takes a logarithmically divergent time to reach the Dirichlet wall, and interestingly, we explicitly demonstrate that the scalar quantum spectrum arising from the Rindler throat yields a Dip-time of the corresponding spectral form factor, which scales with a universal power of the light traversing time. Armed with these, we further consider a $\textit{dressed effective model}$ where the Dirichlet boundary condition is inserted in a ten-dimensional supergravity geometry, where classical string sources back-react. We demonstrate that, as a result of this backreaction, the quantum-dynamical time-scales, $\textit{e.g.}$ the Dip time of the corresponding spectral form factor can be further enhanced with factors of the string length, thereby making the Dirichlet wall configuration better mimic the true black hole. In the dual field theory, the geometry corresponds to thermal states of a large $N$ gauge theory in the Veneziano limit, where both the number of colour and the flavour degrees of freedom are large.</description>

      <title>Chiral algebra, Wilson lines, and mixed Hodge structure of Coulomb branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find an intriguing relation between the chiral algebra and the mixed Hodge structure of the Coulomb branch of four dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal field theories. We identify the space of irreducible characters of the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ chiral algebra $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ by analytically computing the Wilson line Schur index, and imposing modular invariance. We further establish a map from the $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ characters to the characters of the $\mathcal{T}_{p, N}$ chiral algebra. We extract the pure part of the mixed Hodge polynomial $PH_c$ of the Coulomb branch compactified on a circle, and prove that $PH_c$ encodes the representation theory of $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$. We expect this to be a new entry of the 4D mirror symmetry framework.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the AdS3 C-metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dilaton fluctuations near the string based on three classes of solutions of the 3D C-metric within the framework of the string-world holography. As a setup of holography, we focus on the asymptotic symmetry, recover the Virasoro algebra by central extension and get the central charge of the AdS3. Then we reduce the gravity on the brane as a JT gravity model by introducing a fluctuation. As an extension of the braneworld, we also investigate the higher curvature correction to the brane under some conditions. Finally, we make an expansion on generalized entropy of black hole solution with respect to small l and find that the leading term comes from Weyl anomaly, which is different from that in 4-dimensional C-metric.</description>

      <title>Conformal four-point ladder integrals in diverse dimensions and polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, the family of conformal four-point ladder diagrams in arbitrary space-time dimensions is considered. We use the representation obtained via explicit calculation using the operator approach and conformal quantum mechanics to study their properties, such as symmetries, loop and dimensional shift identities. In even integer dimensions, latter allows one to reduce the problem to two-dimensional case, where the notable factorization holds. Additionally, for a specific choice of propagator powers, we show that the representation can be written in the form of linear combinations of classical polylogarithms (with coefficients that are rational functions) and explore the structure of the resulting expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss applications of the proper-time method in a Lorentz-violating extension of QED characterized by the modification of the mass sector through the addition of the term proportional to the antisymmetric tensor $H_{\mu\nu}$. Unlike other LV extensions of QED, in our case the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg-like action turns out to include only odd degrees of the stress tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. Our result is shown to be UV finite, and it is confirmed using the Feynman diagrams framework.</description>

      <title>Long-time behaviour of sphalerons in $\phi^4$ models with a false vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sphalerons in nonlinear Klein-Gordon models are unstable lump-like solutions that arise from a saddle point between true and false vacua in the energy functional. Numerical simulations are presented which show the sphaleron evolving into an accelerating kink-antikink pair whose separation approaches the speed of light asymptotically at large times. Utilizing a nonlinear collective coordinate method, an approximate analytical solution is derived for this evolution. These results indicate that an exact solution is expected to exhibit a gradient blow-up for large times,caused by energy concentrating at the flanks of the kink-antikink pair.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic instability of vacuum with instantons in the holographic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the gauge-gravity duality, we study the electromagnetic instability of vacuum with instantons in holographic plasma. The model we employ is the D(-1)-D3 brane system in which the D(-1)-branes correspond to the instantons in holography. To take into account the flavored quarks, the coincident probe D7-branes as flavors are embedded into the bulk geometry so that the effective electromagnetic Lagrangian with flavors corresponds to the action of the D7-branes according to gauge-gravity duality. We numerically evaluate the vacuum decay rate, the critical electric field and the V-A curve of the vacuum by using the D7-brane action with various values of the electromagnetic field. It implies the particles in the plasma acquire an effective mass in the presence of instantons as it is expected in the quantum field theory, and the plasma trends to become insulating when the electric field is small. This work reveals the relation between electromagnetic and instantonic properties of the vacuum in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics is around the corner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to work on the Euclidean black hole solution with a corner rather than with the prevalent conical singularity. As a result, we find that the Wald formula for black hole entropy can be readily obtained for generic F(Rabcd) gravity by using both the action without the corner term and the action with the corner term due to their equivalence to the first order variation, which implies that it is the corner rather than the corner term that encodes the entropy related information. With such an equivalence, we further make use of a special diffeomorphism to accomplish a direct derivation of the ADM Hamiltonian conjugate to the Killing vector field normal to the horizon in the Lorentz signature as a conjugate variable of the inverse temperature in the grand canonical ensemble.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent 3D oscillator with Coulomb interaction: an alternative approach for analyzing quark-antiquark systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the dynamics of quark-antiquark pair systems is investigated by modelling them as general time-dependent 3D oscillators perturbed by a Coulomb potential. Solving this model enables the prediction of key mesonic properties such as the probability density, energy spectra, and quadrature uncertainties, offering theoretical insights into the confinement of quarks via gluon-mediated strong interactions. To tackle the mathematical difficulty raised by the time dependence of parameters in the system, special mathematical techniques, such as the invariant operator method, unitary transformation method, and the Nikiforov-Uvarov functional analysis (NUFA) are used. The wave functions of the system, derived using these mathematical techniques, are expressed analytically in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function whose mathematical properties are well characterized. Our results provide the quantum mechanical framework of quark-antiquark systems which are essential for exploring the non-perturbative aspects of QCD. In addition, the underlying mathematical structure may serve as a foundation for addressing broader challenges in particle physics, including the origin of mass and its connection to the Higgs mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of defining the field strength of abelian potentials when the spacetime is a Poisson manifold, within the groupoidal approach. The natural definition in terms of gauge invariant momenta is proved to be equivalent to covariant and invariant tensors of a local symplectic groupoid representing a symplectic realization of the Poisson manifold. A Poisson Chern-Simons model is then proposed and its equations of motion are shortly discussed.</description>

      <title>On the universal content of the proper time flow in scalar and Yang-Mills theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the perturbative structure of the proper time renormalization group flow in scalar and Yang-Mills theories. Although the PT flow does not belong to the class of exact functional renormalization group equations, we show that it correctly reproduces the universal coefficients of the $\beta$-functions at one and two loops. For the ${\rm O(N)}$ scalar theory, we derive the one- and two-loop contributions to the running quartic coupling and also confirm the expected anomalous dimension. For the ${\rm SU(N)}$ Yang-Mills theory, using the background field method, we compute the gauge coupling renormalization recovering the correct two-loop $\beta$-function without generating any gauge-symmetry-violating term. These results highlight that, despite its limitations for reconstructing the full effective action, the PT flow retains the essential universal content of renormalization, accounting for its reliability in diverse applications ranging from statistical models to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Lorentz covariant on-shell cubic vertices for continuous-spin fields and integer-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of Lorentz covariant on-shell approach, interacting continuous-spin fields and integer-spin fields in flat space are investigated. Continuous-spin fields are considered by using a Lorentz vector superspace formulation, while integer-spin fields are considered by using oscillator formulation. All parity-even cubic vertices for self-interacting continuous-spin fields realized as functions on the Lorentz vector superspace are obtained. Cross-interactions of continuous-spin fields and integer-spin fields are also derived. Several representatives of cubic vertices realized as distributions are obtained. We show that manifestly Lorentz invariant formal cubic action involving at least one continuous-spin field turns out to be divergent. We find the modification of such action which maintains Lorentz invariance and leads to finite cubic action. One-to-one correspondence of Lorentz covariant cubic vertices and light-cone gauge cubic vertices is demonstrated explicitly.</description>

We introduce appropriate constraints that eliminate the chiral N=1 superfield sector of the non-abelian N=2 multiplets and discuss the properties of the leading order Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>Rotation of intrinsic orbital angular momentum and the orbital Hall effect for twisted particles in arbitrary gravitational fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For twisted particles in arbitrary gravitational fields, the problems of the rotation of intrinsic orbital angular momentum and the orbital Hall effect are solved in the general case. We need not use the Maxwell equations in curved spacetimes for a description of twisted photons. The exact general equation rigorously defining the OAM dynamics in any Riemannian spacetimes is derived. The general description of different manifestations of the orbital Hall effect for any twisted particles is also presented. Our short analysis shows that the results obtained can find important practical applications.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

      <title>Loop quantum inflation with inverse volume corrections in light of ACT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of loop quantum cosmology (LQC), we investigate the effect of inverse volume corrections on the low scale spontaneously broken supersymmetric (SB SUSY) and exponential inflationary potentials. The LQC modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the observational viability of these models against recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Our results indicate that in contrary to the standard model of inflation, in the presence of inverse volume corrections in LQC, the prediction of SB SUSY and exponential potentials in the $r-n_{\rm s}$ plane lie inside the 68\% confidence level interval of the ACT data.</description>

      <title>Effects of the ekpyrotic mechanism on inflationary phase in loop quantum cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In bouncing cosmological models, either classical or quantum, the big bang singularity is replaced by a regular bounce. A challenging question in such models is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it is well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce, where $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to introduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes negative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar field will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter fields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe can be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects the inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation is generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases in which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary potential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the influence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in the models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during which the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem is resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the inflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an inflationary phase. This phase can last long enough to solve the cosmological problems existing in the big bang model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the modularity of mixed periods associated with singular fibers of specific families of Calabi-Yau threefolds. This is done by "fibering out", i.e. by expressing these periods as integrals of periods of families of K3 surfaces and by using modularity properties of the latter. Besides classical periods of holomorphic modular forms and meromorphic modular forms with vanishing residues, the computations lead to new interesting periods associated with meromorphic modular forms with non-vanishing residues as well as contours between CM points.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</description>

      <title>Operator dependence and robustness of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin system, with particular attention to how it depends on the spatial profile and operator content of the applied perturbation, as well as its robustness against increase of amplitude and temporal discretization. Motivated by recent theoretical proposals linking such response patterns to the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, we numerically analyze the real-time dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm. We find that sharply localized and periodically recurring responses emerge only for specific types of perturbations, namely those that correspond to local density fields in the continuum limit. In contrast, perturbations involving other spin components produce conventional propagating excitations without localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the response remains qualitatively robust when the time-dependent perturbation is approximated by a piecewise-linear function, highlighting the practical relevance of our findings for quantum simulation platforms with limited temporal resolution. Our results clarify the operator dependence of emergent bulk-like dynamics in critical spin chains and offer guidance for probing holographic physics in experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomials of tensors via Grassmann integrals and distributions of roots for random Gaussian tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new definition of characteristic polynomials of tensors based on a partition function of Grassmann variables. This new notion of characteristic polynomial addresses general tensors including totally antisymmetric ones, but not totally symmetric ones. Drawing an analogy with matrix eigenvalues obtained from the roots of their characteristic polynomials, we study the roots of our tensor characteristic polynomial. Unlike standard definitions of eigenvalues of tensors of dimension $N$ giving $\sim e^{{\text{constant}} \, N}$ number of eigenvalues, our polynomial always has $N$ roots. For random Gaussian tensors, the density of roots follows a generalized Wigner semi-circle law based on the Fuss-Catalan distribution, introduced previously by Gurau [arXiv:2004.02660 [math-ph]].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of entanglement in relativistic $2\to 2$ scattering described by a perturbative $S$-matrix, we derive analytically the concurrence for a mixed final state of two qubits corresponding to a discrete quantum number of the scattered particles. Given an initial product state, the derived concurrence depends at the leading order on the real part of the inelastic forward amplitude and the initial state only. We also point out that the real part of the forward amplitude provides a subleading correction to the linearized entropy, reducing it by an amount that, for a computational-basis state, is equivalent to the relative entropy of coherence. We illustrate our findings with two examples of phenomenological interest: high-energy scattering of two scalar fields in the two-Higgs doublet model, and high-energy electron-positron annihilation.</description>

      <title>Impact of Thermodynamic Corrections on the Stability of Hayward-Anti de Sitter Black Hole Surrounded by a Fluid of Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the modified thermodynamics of a Hayward-Anti de Sitter (H-AdS) black hole in atypical conditions, incorporating a string fluid, Hayward regularisation, and quantum entropy corrections. Our analysis reveals a first-order phase transition between small and large black hole phases, characterised by a swallowtail behaviour in the Gibbs free energy profiles. It is found that the key parameters - string fluid strength, Hayward regularisation scale, and quantum correction coefficients significantly influence the critical temperature and phase stability of the H-AdS system. It is further noticed that a large black hole phase is stabilised by these modifications, with quantum corrections smoothing the transition. This model offers a valuable framework to study quantum gravity effects on black hole thermodynamics with potential implications in analysing black hole evolution and astrophysical observations.</description>

Abstract: Einstein-bumblebee gravity is one of the simplest vector-tensor theories that realizes spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. In this work, we first construct an exact dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole solution in four dimensions, carrying both electric and magnetic charges and admitting general topological horizons. We then study its thermodynamic properties, and employ the Wald formalism to compute the conserved mass and entropy, thereby establishing the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we generalize these results to Taub-Newman-Unti-Tamburino case and higher dimensions case.</description>

In these proceedings, I provide an overview of studies presented in talks and posters at Quark Matter 2025 on this topic. We will focus on the latest developments regarding the features and the numerical description of the non-equilibrium pre-QGP matter, as well as the potential to use hard probes as a means to study the hydrodynamization dynamics of the QCD plasma.</description>

      <title>Stability of graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under harsh conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the high stability of simulated graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under large externally imposed deformations and high temperature annealing. Hyperbolic pseudospheres are produced in a two-step Molecular Dynamics simulation process. First, carbon atoms are forced down a thin three-dimensional volume of a chosen shape. During this extrusion process the carbon atoms form a precursor to graphene that is unrealistically less stable than graphite or diamond. Then the unstable carbon structure is annealed inside the thin volume at high temperature, turning the carbon into realistic polycrystalline, curved graphene. Point defects naturally appear in numbers and places that stabilize the graphene in the desired shape, without high residual stresses. We applied this new methodology to the creation of graphene hyperbolic pseudosphere surfaces, which reproduce analogs to some aspects of classical or quantum gravity. The free edges of the pseudosphere cause bending of the graphene. When these free edges are removed from the simulations by attaching periodic flat graphene sheets to the pseudosphere edges, the carbon atoms assume positions just some tenths of \r{A} from the mathematical hyperbolic pseudosphere surface. In demanding tests of their stability, the hyperbolic pseudospheres proved stable against $20^\circ$ shearing or $20\%$ elongation and then being released, which eventually raised their temperatures by $\sim 300 \ \text{K}$. Our methodology is relatively easy to use and offers a practical way to create simulated curved graphene surfaces of almost any shape. It allows for thorough testing in advance of the stability of graphene shapes that are to be produced experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional models of critical non-intersecting loops, there are $\ell$-leg fields that insert $\ell\in\mathbb{N}^*$ open loop segments and can have nonzero conformal spins, and diagonal fields that change the weights of closed loops. We conjecture an exact formula for 3-point functions of such fields on the sphere. In the cases of diagonal or spinless 2-leg fields, the conjecture agrees with known results from Conformal Loop Ensembles.
  We numerically compute 3-point functions in loop models on cylindrical lattices, using transfer matrix techniques. The results agree with the conjecture in almost all cases. We attribute the few discrepancies to difficulties that can arise in our lattice computation when the relevant modules of the unoriented Jones-Temperley-Lieb algebra have degenerate ground states.</description>

      <title>Stochastic instantons and the tail of the inflationary density perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the "stochastic $\delta N$ formalism", the statistics of the inflationary density perturbation are obtained from the first passage distribution of a stochastic process. We develop a general framework in which to evaluate the rare tail of this distribution, based on an instanton approximation to a path integral representation for the transition probability. We relate our formalism to the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, by integrating out short wavelength degrees of freedom to produce an influence functional. This provides a principled way to extend the calculation beyond the slow-roll limit, and to models with multiple fields. We argue that our framework has a number of advantages in comparison with existing methods. In particular, it reliably captures the tail behaviour in cases where existing techniques do not apply, including cases where the noise amplitude has strong time dependence. We demonstrate the method by computing the tail probability in a number of scenarios, including a beyond-slow-roll analysis of a linear potential, ultra-slow-roll, and constant-roll inflation. We find close agreement with results already reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss a scenario with exponentially decaying noise amplitude. This is a model for the stochastic evolution of a fixed comoving volume of spacetime on superhorizon scales. In this case we show that the tail reverts to a Gaussian weight.</description>

      <title>Anyon interactions in the Chern--Simons--Landau--Ginzburg model of the fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with non-monotonic interaction energy.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIb. Eigenmodes, correlation matrices, and detectability of non-orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. In this paper we consider the non-orientable Euclidean topologies \E{7}--\E{10}, \E{13}--\E{15}, and \E{17}, encompassing the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the CMB sky. We find that in manifolds where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about $1.2$ times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB, we expect a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. Our limited selection of manifold parameters are exemplary of interesting behaviors, but not necessarily representative. Future searches for topology will require a thorough exploration of the parameter space to determine what values of the parameters predict statistical correlations that are convincingly attributable to topology.[Abridged]</description>

      <title>Barnett effect as a new source of magnetic field in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Barnett effect is a fundamental magnetomechanical phenomenon in which a ferromagnetic material becomes magnetized under rotation. Using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) model under rigid rotation, we compute the Barnett magnetization ($M_{\rm Barnett}$) and show that it produces a magnetic field ($B_{\text{ind}}$) comparable in magnitude to the well-known external field ($B_{\text{ext}}$) from spectator protons at low energy heavy-ion collisions. This finding establishes the Barnett effect as a previously overlooked but essential source of magnetization and magnetic field in the heavy-ion collisions, with profound implications for understanding spin dynamics and anomalous transport in quantum chromodynamics under extreme rotation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.07600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If we start from certain functional relations as definition of a quantum integrable theory, then we can derive from them a linear integral equation. It can be extended, by introducing dynamical variables, to become an equation with the form of Marchenko's. Then, we derive from the latter a classical (differential) Lax pair. We exemplify our method by focusing on the massive version of the ODE/IM (Ordinary Differential Equations/Integrable Models) correspondence from Quantum sine-Gordon (sG) with many moduli/masses to the classical sinh-Gordon (shG) equation, so describing, in a particular case, some super-symmetric gauge theories and the $AdS_3$ strong coupling scattering amplitudes/Wilson loops. Yet, we present it in a way which reveals its generality of application. In fact, we give some hints on how it works for spin chains.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Applicability of Birkhoff's Theorem in Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive and technically rigorous analysis of the status of Birkhoff's theorem in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, a paradigmatic two-dimensional model for studying semiclassical gravitational dynamics. While Birkhoff's theorem is well established in four-dimensional general relativity asserting the uniqueness and staticity of vacuum solutions under reflection symmetry remains subtle due to the absence of propagating gravitational degrees of freedom. In this work, we systematically investigate the space of symmetry under radially symmetric configurations in JT gravity using both conformal and Schwarzschild like gauges. Through analytical techniques and integral transformations, we explore the conditions under which vacuum solutions remain time-independent, identifying classes of metric dilaton configurations that either uphold or violate Birkhoff type behavior. Our findings reveal that the theorem holds only in restricted cases, depending critically on the separability of the conformal factor and the structure of the dilaton potential. These results clarify longstanding ambiguities surrounding symmetry and dynamics in two-dimensional gravity and establish JT gravity as a controlled setting for probing the breakdown of classical gravitational theorems in lower dimensional and holographic contexts. This analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between symmetry, integrability, and geometry in quantum gravity and strongly coupled systems.</description>

Abstract: We show that previous correspondence between some (integrable) statistical field theory quantities and periods of $SU(2)$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ deformed gauge theory still holds if we add $N_f=1,2$ flavours of matter. Moreover, the correspondence entails a new non-perturbative solution to the theory. Eventually, we use this solution to give exact results on quasinormal modes of black branes and holes.</description>

Abstract: Feynman diagrams (notably the triangle diagram) involving heavy enough particles contain branch cuts on the physical sheet - anomalous thresholds - which, unlike normal thresholds and bound-state poles, do not correspond to any asymptotic $n$-particle state. ``Who ordered that?" We show that anomalous thresholds arise as a consequence of established S-matrix principles and two reasonable assumptions: unitarity below the physical region and analyticity in the mass. We find explicit nonperturbative formulas for the anomalous threshold singularity and test them against the Coleman-Thun poles of the exactly solvable $E_8$ integrable model.</description>

Abstract: We propose to use the winding number of the gradient of a scalar potential as a simple topological index that relates critical points in the interior of the scalar field space to the behavior of the potential at the (asymptotic) boundary of the field space. We demonstrate this technique for supersymmetric flux compactifications of M-theory on Calabi-Yau four-folds, and use the Fermat sextic as a simple, one-parameter example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the embedding formalism to construct conformal fields in $D$ dimensions, by restricting Lorentz-invariant ensembles of homogeneous neural networks in $(D+2)$ dimensions to the projective null cone. Conformal correlators may be computed using the parameter space description of the neural network. Exact four-point correlators are computed in a number of examples, and we perform a 4D conformal block decomposition that elucidates the spectrum. In some examples the analysis is facilitated by recent approaches to Feynman integrals. Generalized free CFTs are constructed using the infinite-width Gaussian process limit of the neural network, enabling a realization of the free boson. The extension to deep networks constructs conformal fields at each subsequent layer, with recursion relations relating their conformal dimensions and four-point functions. Numerical approaches are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an off-shell bosonic string action that removes the renormalization window constraint of [1]. To all orders in conformal perturbation theory, this action allows for deformations of the worldsheet theory by any primary or descendant irrelevant deformation. Non-perturbatively, this action has no spurious solutions on the space of all worldsheet theories with a unitary matter sector that flows from a UV fixed point. We find that non-minimal couplings dressed with more than one factor of the Ricci curvature behave as gauge redundancies. As part of our investigation of this action, we find non-smooth behavior in the Zamolodchikov $C$-function. Our results mostly apply to Euclidean-signature target spaces, but can be extended to Lorentzian backgrounds which are invariant under time translations and CTO symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the lore establishing the allowed space of field redefinitions and show that there are essentially no restrictions. Our conclusions hold to all orders in perturbation theory and for any dispersion relation. Field redefinitions can be nonlocal, symmetry breaking, or in certain cases have explicit dependence on spacetime. We address field redefinitions that can be resummed into the propagator, which demonstrates how to perform perturbative calculations away from the minimum in field space. Field redefinitions are used to derive higher-order Schwinger-Dyson equations, which imply multiparticle soft theorems. Non-standard field redefinitions are showcased using both relativistic and nonrelativistic examples.</description>

Abstract: We revisit Narain conformal field theories from an algebraic perspective based on finite dimensional Lie algebras $\mathbf{g}$ and representations $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbf{g}}$, and show how the root and weight lattices can encode the momenta and subsequently the partition functions of Narain theories. In this framework, we construct a realisation of the Zamolodchikov metric of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{g}}$ in terms of Lie algebraic data namely the Cartan matrix K$_{\mathbf{g}}$ and its inverse K$_{\mathbf{g}}^{-1}$. Properties regarding the ensemble averaging of these CFTs and their holographic dual are also derived. Additionally, we discuss possible generalisations to NCFTs having dis-symmetric central charges $(\mathrm{c}_{L},\mathrm{c}_{R})=(\mathrm{s},% \mathrm{r})$ with $s&gt;r$ and highlight further features of the partition function Z$_{\mathbf{g}}^{(r,r)}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.</description>

Abstract: The Lie algebra of symmetries generated by the left-moving current $j=\partial_-\phi$ in the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory is infinite dimensional, exhibiting mutually commuting subalgebras. The infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras define integrable deformations of the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory which preserve the Poisson bracket structure. We study these mutually commuting subalgebras, finding general properties that the generators of such a subalgebra must satisfy. Along the way, we derive constraints on integrable equations of the Korteweg-de Vries type. We also confirm that the recently found $[j]=0,-1,-2$ mutually commuting subalgebras are infinite dimensional.</description>

      <title>Modified Microcausality from Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic microcausality is the statement that local field operators commute outside the light-cone. This condition is known to break down in low-energy effective theories, such as $P(X)$ models with a derivative interaction term of the ``wrong sign". Despite their Lorentz-invariant form, these theories can exhibit superluminal propagation on Lorentz-breaking backgrounds. We approach this phenomenon by computing the full operator-valued commutator in position space, perturbatively in interaction picture. After testing this formalism on a $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, we apply it to a $P(X)$ model. There, we show that the perturbative corrections to the free-theory commutator contain derivatives of delta functions with support on the standard Minkowski light cone. While these corrections vanish on Lorentz-invariant states, they become ``activated" on states where Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken. In this case, they approximate the new ``sound-cone" by means of a Taylor expansion. By applying linear response theory to an extended source, we show that deviations from standard causality are already present at first order in this expansion. Finally, we try to understand what goes wrong with the standard argument according to which Lorentz invariance implies microcausality.</description>

      <title>The area and volume laws for entanglement of scalar fields in flat and cosmological spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the area and volume laws for entanglement of free quantum scalar fields. In addition to the entropy, we use the notion of the capacity of entanglement, which measures entropy fluctuations. We consider flat spacetimes as well as the curved ones relevant for cosmology. Moreover, we put special emphasis on quench phenomena and different geometries of the entangling surfaces. First, we show that, in the Minkowski spacetime, the capacity of entanglement, like entropy, exhibits the area law for two kinds of geometries of the entangling surfaces: the sphere and strip. Moreover, we show that the ratio of both quantities takes the same values for both surfaces. Next, we turn our attention to quenches. Namely, we analyse the dynamics of capacity; in particular, contribution of the volume and surface terms. Moreover, we compare these results with theoretical predictions resulting from the quasiparticles model. In the second part, we consider the above issues for the FLRW spaces; especially, for de Sitter space as well as a metric modeling the transition to radiation-dominated era. Finally, we analyse the abrupt quenches in de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Type I anomaly cancellation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the issue of how the perturbative and global fermion anomaly of Type I string theory in ten dimensions is cancelled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism using the RR fields. This will be done by realising the RR fields as boundary modes of an eleven-dimensional bulk theory described in terms of a quadratic refinement of the differential KO-theory pairing. We will then generalise this analysis to Sugimoto's $usp(32)$ string and Sagnotti's $u(32)$ string.
  We also discuss in a more general setting the procedures which need to be followed when we try to cancel fermion anomalies in terms of $p$-form fields based on differential K-theory classes. This we illustrate by performing an analysis of the mod-2 anomaly cancellation in nine dimensions arising from the $S^1$ compactification of the Type I theory.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=1$ Jackiw -Teitelboim supergravity beyond the Schwarzian regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic symmetry structure of two--dimensional dilaton gravity in its $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric extension based on the $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ Lie superalgebra. Within the BF theoretical framework, we analyze affine and superconformal boundary conditions for each case and systematically derive the associated asymptotic symmetry algebras. While the classical theory recovers the Virasoro algebra or its affine enhancement, the supersymmetric extension yields a classical $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal algebra, subject to dynamical symmetry breaking mechanisms induced by the dilaton supermultiplet. We find that the boundary behavior of the dilaton not only leads to a reduction of the full affine $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)_k$ symmetry down to $\tt{O} \tt{S} p(1|2)$, but also introduces an abelian extension through commuting modes. These results reveal a novel interplay between symmetry breaking and symmetry extension in low-dimensional supergravity. Our construction generalizes previous analyses of $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ dilaton gravity to the supersymmetric domain and offers a consistent foundation for investigating boundary dynamics beyond the Schwarzian regime.</description>

      <title>Notes on exact solvability for rotating and pulsating strings in nonrelativistic Lifshitz background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct one dimensional exactly solvable model by choosing a probe fundamental string rotating and pulsating in the planar Lifshitz spacetime that follows nonrelativistic Lifshitz scaling. We present suitable sets of embedding coordinates for rotating and pulsating strings to embed the string worldsheet on a hyperboloid with anisotropy-dependent eccentricity. The resulting worldsheet Lagrangians straightforwardly reduce to the Lagrangian of a Neumann-Rosochatius integrable model. Although the model assumes exact solutions for both the chosen ansatz its classical Liouville integrability is found to be conditional due to the presence of finite anisotropy in the target space geometry. We further use the exact solutions of the model to yield energy-momentum dispersion relations. We interpret those from the perspective of highly degenerate frustrated $J_1-J_2$ spin chain for rotating string and frustration-free Motzkin spin chain for pulsating string.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the false vacuum decay at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The false vacuum decay rate is of important meaning in understanding the Universe, such as the symmetry breaking process in the early universe and the age of our universe, which is conventionally calculated with the saddle-point approximation in the field theory. Utilizing the extension of the Wigner function in quantum field theory, we numerically calculate the decay rate of the false vacuum through path integral. We study the decay rate for the thermal fluctuation scenarios and its dependence on the potential shape, and found that the false vacuum decay occurs following an exponentially decay rate, and the speed of vacuum decay decreases when the initial energy of the system decreases and the potential height increase. The discrepancy between the simulation results and the theoretical prediction of finite temperature effective field theory is observed.</description>

      <title>Correlator Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, "cosmohedra" have been introduced as polytopes underlying the cosmological wavefunction for conformally coupled Tr($\Phi^3$) theory in FRW cosmologies, generalizing associahedra for flat space scattering amplitudes. In this letter we show that correlation functions are also directly captured by a new polytope - the "Correlatron". The combinatorics of correlation functions is an interesting blend of flat space scattering amplitudes and wavefunctions. This is reflected in the correlatron geometry, which is a one-higher dimensional polytope sandwiched between cosmohedron and associahedron facets. We provide an explicit embedding for the correlatron, which is a natural extension of the "shaving" picture for cosmohedra to one higher dimension. As a byproduct, we also define "graph correlahedra" as polytopes for the contribution to correlators from any fixed graph. We show how the canonical form of these polytopes directly computes the graph correlator, without the power of two weights seen in previous geometric formulations. Finally, we give a prescription for extracting the full correlator from the canonical form of the correlatron.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transparency of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of electromagnetic and gravitational waves off a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the low-temperature regime where the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations. We find that the black hole is transparent to electromagnetic and gravitational radiation of fixed helicity below a certain frequency threshold. This phenomenon arises because the angular momentum of the black hole is quantized, creating an energy gap between the spinless black hole state and the first excited spinning states. Radiation with angular momentum -- such as photons, gravitons, and partial waves of a massless scalar field, which we also study -- must supply enough energy to bridge this gap to be absorbed. Below this threshold, no absorption can occur, rendering the black hole transparent. For frequencies above the gap, the scarcity of black hole states continues to suppress the absorption cross-section relative to semiclassical predictions, making the black hole translucent rather than completely transparent. Notably, electromagnetic absorption is significantly stronger than gravitational absorption, beyond what differences in spin alone would suggest.</description>

      <title>The late time ramp from chord diagrams in the double-scaled SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the ramp of the spectral form factor analytically from chord diagrams in double scaled SYK. We map the double-trace correlator to a sum of single trace two-point functions over a basis of operators. We then reproduce the local eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory from the chord diagrams perspective, which is the $q= 0$ limit of double scaled SYK, and identify the relevant operators that give rise to the late-time ramp. We then extend the computation to finite $q$, resulting in the late time contribution to the spectral form factor. We verify that the late time asymptotics of the finite $q$ computation gives rise to the expected late time ramp. Our computation also provides the corresponding trumpet partition function and gluing factor for chords, which form the basis of a chord analog to topological recursion.</description>

We find that some of the resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while keeping the total energy (mass) constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A one-parameter family of nonlinear (quartic) Klein-Gordon models having a sphaleron solution is studied. The sphaleron arises from a saddle point between true and false vacua in the energy functional. Its instability is shown be governed by a Heun differential equation after a change of variable. This allows an explicit formulation of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues to be obtained in terms of local Heun functions. Good approximations are found for certain ranges of the parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01949v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the background charged bosonic free-field approach to the rational principal quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov (QDS) $\mathcal{W} \big[ \widehat{g} \big](p,p')$ minimal models with boundaries, where $g$ is a simple bosonic Lie algebra. We express their Ishibashi states using the free-field Ishibashi states, and calculate disk two-point correlation functions using the free-field vertex operators with intertwiner insertions. The integral results are obtained by repeatedly applying the Euler-type integral expression and the Taylor expansions of Lauricella's hypergeometric functions $F_{D}^{(n)}$. We also discuss the background free-field approach to the QDS $\mathcal{W} $ algebras related to a semi-simple Lie algebra $g$, and apply a coset free-field resolution to express diagonal ADE coset $\mathcal{W}$ minimal Ishibashi states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for studying $d+1$ dimensional Euclidean Schwarzschild black holes with Hawking temperature near the Hagedorn temperature and Horowitz-Polchinski solutions. The worldsheet theory that describes some of these backgrounds is strongly coupled. We use its underlying affine $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry to continue to weak coupling, by varying the level of the current algebra from the small value relevant for black holes and HP solutions to a large value. In this limit, one can describe the dynamics by a solvable effective field theory, and the non-geometric features of the original problem are geometrized. The resulting construction is closely related to previous work on the non-abelian Thirring model, and sheds light on both problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Courant-Hilbert (CH) construction of integrable deformations of a two-dimensional principal chiral model (2D PCM) in the context of the four-dimensional Chern-Simons (4D CS) theory. According to this construction, an integrable deformation of 2D PCM is characterized by a boundary function. As a result, the master formula obtained from the 4D CS theory should be corrected by the trace of the energy-momentum tensor so as to support the CH construction. We present some examples of deformation including the $T\bar{T}$-deformation, the root $T\bar{T}$-deformation, the two-parameter mixed deformation, and a logarithmic deformation. Finally, we discuss some generalizations and potential applications of this CH construction.</description>

Abstract: We study the size and shape statistics of ground state fuzzy spheres when projected onto the transverse plane, utilizing the regularized SU(N=2) matrix model in D=(1+3)-dimensional spacetime. We show that they appear as ellipses, from matrix/membrane correspondence. With our numerical and analytical approximation for the ground state wavefunction, we provide estimations for their expectation surface areas, perimeters, eccentricities, and shape-parameters. These geometric constants of quantum membranes deviate drastically from classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>String loop origin for dark radiation and superheavy dark matter in type IIB compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the significance of string loop corrections, in a perturbative moduli stabilization scenario, focusing on their role in unraveling the origin of dark radiation in the late cosmological epoch and their correlation to dark matter. More specifically, a detailed analysis is provided in which the mass hierarchy of the normalized fields in the K{\"a}hler moduli sector is determined by the scales of the integer fluxes and the quantum corrections. Furthermore, we compute the previously underestimated contributions to the decay rates of moduli to axions, which behave as dark radiation, highlighting their connection to the aforementioned higher-order corrections. Two contrasting reheating scenarios (low-scale and high-scale) are provided, depending on the decay rate of the longest-lived particle into the Standard Model degrees of freedom through a Giudice-Masiero mechanism, while the effective number of neutrino species $\Delta N_{eff}$ remains below the respective bounds. Finally, a non-thermal dark matter scenario is proposed based on the decays of heavy scalar fields, where the main production mechanisms are investigated, leading to a dark matter candidate mass ranging from a few $GeV$ up to $10^{12}\; GeV$.</description>

Four refractive indices associated with circularly polarized waves are achieved, implying circular birefringence with rotatory power endowed with double sign reversal, an exotic optical signature for chiral dielectrics. The Kerr rotation and ellipticity are analyzed, with an unusual observation of a giant rotation angle deprived of discontinuity. Anomalous enhanced reflectance (R greater than unity) is also reported, associated with negative refraction stemming from the anomalous transport properties. These effects constitute the singular optical signature of a nonequilibrium bi-isotropic medium with the AHE.</description>

      <title>Firewall boundaries and mixed phases of rotating quark matter in linear sigma model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rigidly-rotating body in unbounded space is usually considered a pathological system since it leads to faster-than-light velocities and associated breaches of causality. However, numerical results on chiral symmetry breaking in rotating plasmas of interacting fermions reveal surprisingly close correspondence in predictions between the rigorous bounded and formal unbounded approaches. To provide insight into this correlation, we consider the linear sigma model coupled to quarks, undergoing rigid rotation in unbounded Minkowski space-time. Within the mean-field approach, we adopt three consecutive levels of approximation to the ground state of the system that feature uniform (model 1), weakly inhomogeneous (model 2) and fully inhomogeneous (model 3) condensates. Models 1 and 2 that do not take into account spatial gradients of the condensate show agreement with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. Model 3 exhibits a deviation from the Tolman-Ehrenfest prediction due to the appearance of a new energy scale set by the inhomogeneity of the ground state. Its boundary conditions are fixed by imposing regularity at the rotation axis and by demanding the global minimization of the grand potential. We dub the latter as ``firewall boundary conditions,'' translating into the requirement of vanishing condensate on the light cylinder, which follows from the fact that the system state formally diverges at the light cylinder. In all models, we present the phase diagram of the system and point out that in models 2 and 3, the system resides either in a chirally-restored phase, or in a mixed phase that possesses spatially-separated chirally-restored and chirally-broken phases. Finally, we discuss the properties of the system under inhomogeneous rotation using the relativistic version of the Rankine vortex model.</description>

      <title>Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system at integer index $k$: polynomial algebras of integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001 and was called in literature the TTW system. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces. It is checked that for $k=1,2,3,4$ that the Hamiltonian $H$, two integrals ${\cal I}_{1,2}$ and their commutator ${\cal I}_{12} = [{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2]$ are four generating elements of the polynomial algebra of integrals of the order $(k+1)$: $[{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_{12}] = P_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, $[{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_{12}] = Q_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, where $P_{k+1},Q_{k+1}$ are polynomials of degree $(k+1)$ written in terms of ordered monomials of $H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12}$. This implies that polynomial algebra of integrals is subalgebra of $g^{(k)}$. It is conjectured that all is true for any integer $k$.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological implications of a class of non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through well-motivated models in particle physics, we demonstrate the power of a general class of selection rules arising from non-invertible fusion algebras that are only exact at low orders in perturbation theory. Surprisingly, these non-invertible selection rules can even be applied to the minimal extension of the Standard Model, which is to add a gauge-singlet real scalar. In this model, we show that Fibonacci fusion rules lead to experimentally testable features for the scattering processes of the real scalar. We anticipate that this class of non-invertible selection rules can be applied to a wide range of models beyond the Standard Model. To further strengthen our methodology, we discuss a dark matter model based on the Ising fusion rules, where the dark matter is labeled by the non-invertible element in the algebra, hence its stability is preserved at all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high complexity of many-body quantum dynamics means that essentially all approaches either exploit special structure or are approximate in nature. One such approach--the memory function formalism--involves a carefully chosen split into fast and slow modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. Using a formulation in operator Krylov space known as the recursion method, we prove the emergence of a universal random matrix description of the fast mode dynamics. This is captured by the level-$n$ Green's function $G_n (z)$, which we show approaches universal scaling forms in the fast limit $n\to\infty$. Notably, this emergent universality can occur in both chaotic and non-chaotic systems, provided their spectral functions are smooth. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT), even though there is no explicit randomness present in the Hamiltonian. At finite $z$ we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, while if $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application of this universality, we give a numerical method--the spectral bootstrap--for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof involves a map to a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, rigorously controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. We are led via steepest-descent to a Coulomb gas optimization problem, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the `Operator Growth Hypothesis--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. These results elevate the recursion method to a theoretically principled framework with universal content.</description>

      <title>Effects of bumblebee gravity on neutrino motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores how the spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry -- modeled through a black hole solution in the context of bumblebee gravity -- affects the propagation and dynamics of neutrinos. The investigation centers on three distinct aspects: the rate of energy deposition due to neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation, modifications to the neutrino oscillation phase driven by the underlying spacetime structure, and the influence of gravitational lensing on flavor conversion probabilities. To support the theoretical considerations, numerical simulations are conducted for oscillation probabilities in a two-flavor framework, taking into account both normal and inverted mass orderings. For comparison, the outcomes are juxtaposed with those obtained in a different Lorentz-violating background, namely, a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for the integrand-level reduction of two-loop helicity amplitudes in both $d=4-2\epsilon$ and $d=4$ dimensions. The amplitude is expressed in terms of a set of Feynman integrals and their coefficients that depend on the external kinematics. The analysis presented in this paper, in conjunction with the ongoing development of the computational framework $\text{HELAC-2LOOP}$, paves the road for the construction of an automated program for two-loop amplitude calculations for arbitrary scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Black hole photon ring beyond General Relativity: an integrable parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the shape of the photon ring in black holes images has been argued to provide a sharp test of the Kerr hypothesis for future black hole imaging missions. In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr geometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole parameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that end, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the Kerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the fundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides exhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the representants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of Petrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are encoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar angle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the radial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve, to which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to derive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term of the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result, we confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like objects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given inclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass and spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin parameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\alpha$. Therefore, future tests of the Kerr hypothesis could be achieved only provided one can measure independently the mass and spin of the black hole to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>CALICO: Computing Annihilators from Linear Identities Constraining (differential) Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the method of parametric annihilators for deriving integral relations. Parametric annihilators are differential operators that annihilate multivalued integration kernels appearing in suitable integral representations of special functions. We illustrate this approach in a way that applies to a broad variety of integral representations. We describe a method for computing parametric annihilators based on efficient linear solvers and use them to derive relations between a wide class of special functions related to important problems in high-energy physics. We also formulate a similar method for deriving differential equations satisfied by the independent integrals within an integral family. We show applications to several classes of special functions, including hypergeometric functions, loop integrals in various representations (including Baikov, loop-by-loop Baikov, Lee-Pomeransky and Schwinger representations) and duals of loop integrals. We finally present the public Mathematica package CALICO for computing parametric annihilators and its usage in several examples of high relevance in theoretical particle physics.</description>

Abstract: We study the formation and behaviour of bound states formed outside the horizon of a black hole in the presence of quintessence matter. Calculating the Regge and Wheeler potential for general metric function, we find that the presence of quintessence influences significantly the metric function and the Hawking temperature. We show that large black holes radiate less in the presence of quintessence matter and it seems to live longer, while small black holes radiate more in comparison with the model in the absence of quintessence. Bound states emerge at large enough quintessence parameter $|w|$ or angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Algebraically special perturbations of the Kerr black hole: a metric formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbations of the Kerr black hole are notoriously difficult to describe in the metric formalism and are usually studied in terms of perturbations of the Weyl scalars. In this work, we focus on the algebraically special linear perturbations (ASLP) of the Kerr geometry and show how one can describe this subsector of the perturbations solely using the metric formulation. To that end, we consider the most general twisting algebraically special solution space of vacuum General Relativity. By linearizing around the Kerr solution, we obtain two coupled partial differential wave equations describing the dynamics of the Kerr ASLP. We provide an algorithm to solve them analytically in the small spin approximation up to third order, providing the first exact solution of this kind in the metric formulation. Then, we use this framework to study the stationary zero modes of the Kerr geometry. We present the exact analytical form of the shifts in mass and spin together with the required change of coordinates needed to identify them. Finally, we also provide for the first time closed expressions for the solution-generating perturbations generating the NUT and acceleration charges, thus deforming the Kerr solution to the linearized Kerr-NUT and spinning C-metric. These results provide a first concrete and rare example of perturbations of the Kerr black hole which can be treated entirely in the metric formulation. They can serve as a useful testbed to search for hidden symmetries of the Kerr perturbations.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurements of the Electroweak Mixing Angle in the Region of the Z pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the current status and techniques used in precision measurements of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ (a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model (SM)) in the region of the Z pole with emphasis on hadron colliders. We also build on these techniques to extract the most precise single measurement to date of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from a new analysis of the published forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{\rm FB}$) in Drell-Yan dielpton production in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV measured by the CMS collaboration at the large hadron collider. The uncertainty in $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ published by CMS is dominated by uncertainties in Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), which are reduced by PDF profiling using the dilepton mass dependence of $A_{\rm FB}$. Our new extraction of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from the CMS values of $A_{\rm FB}$ includes profiling with additional new CMS measurements of the $W$-boson decay lepton asymmetry, and W/Z cross section ratio at 13 TeV. We obtain the most precise single measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ to date of 0.23156$\pm$0.00024, which is in excellent agreement with the SM prediction of 0.23161$\pm$0.00004. We also discuss outlook for future measurements at the LHC including more precise measurements of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$, a measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ for b-quarks in the initial state, and a measurement of the running of $\sin^2\theta^{\overline{\rm MS}}(\mu)$ up to 3 TeV.</description>

      <title>Polarized tau decay and CP violation in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of $\tau$-lepton polarization in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) as a novel application of the intense electromagnetic fields generated in such processes. In particular, we analyze the decay distributions of polarized $\tau$-leptons produced via photon-photon fusion, focusing on both leptonic and semi-leptonic channels. We show that the external magnetic field present in UPCs induces a preferred spin quantization axis, which modifies the angular and energy distributions of $\tau$ decay products relative to the standard helicity frame. By formulating the spin polarization along the magnetic field direction, we derive modified polarization-sensitive observables and demonstrate how kinematic selections can retain nonvanishing polarization signals even after ensemble averaging. Furthermore, we propose that the relative polarization of $\tau^-$ and $\tau^+$, accessible through complementary angular ranges of their decay products, serves as a sensitive observable for potential CP-violating effects. This framework provides a pathway for future experimental studies at the LHC and future colliders to exploit polarized $\tau$ decays in UPCs as an application of the strong electromagnetic fields to probe new sources of CP violation.</description>

      <title>Surface Topological Quantum Criticality II: Conformal manifolds, Isolated fixed points and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are smooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various interacting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on previous observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as an exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \(N_c\), becomes infinite. We identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated with the conformal manifolds. By considering \(N_c\) as finite but large, we show that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that results in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG) flow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed points into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an emergent \(SO(\mathcal{N})\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \(N_c \rightarrow \infty\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction of the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement entropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum fluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where interaction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies provide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical points with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing many fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role of entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality classes of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open questions and possible future directions.</description>

      <title>Momentum correlation in pair production by spacetime dependent fields from scattered wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Sauter-Schwinger pair production by electric fields that depend on both time and space, $E(t,z)$ and $E(t,x,y)$. For space-independent fields, $E(t)$, momentum conservation, $\delta({\bf p}+{\bf p}')$, fixes the positron momentum, ${\bf p}'$, in terms of the electron momentum, ${\bf p}$. For $E(t,z)$, on the other hand, $p_z$ and $p'_z$ are independent. However, previous exact-numerical studies have considered only the probability as a function of a single momentum variable, $P(p_z)$, $P(p'_z)$ or $P(p'_z-p_z)$, but not the correlation $P(p_z,p'_z)$. In this paper, we show how to obtain $P(p_z,p'_z)$ by solving the Dirac equation numerically. To do so, we split the wave function into a background and a scattered wave, $\psi(t,{\bf x})=\psi_{\rm back.}(t,{\bf x})+\psi_{\rm scat.}(t,{\bf x})$, where $\psi_{\rm back.}\propto\exp(\pm ipx+\text{gauge term})$. $\psi_{\rm scat.}$ vanishes outside a past light cone and is obtained by solving $(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m)\psi_{\rm scat.}=-(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m)\psi_{\rm back.}$ backwards in time starting with $\psi_{\rm scat.}(t\to+\infty,{\bf x})=0$.</description>

      <title>Conifold gap and all-genus mirror symmetry for local $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Conifold Gap Conjecture asserts that the polar part of the Gromov-Witten potential of a Calabi-Yau threefold near its conifold locus has a universal expression described by the logarithm of the Barnes $G$-function. In this paper, I prove the Conifold Gap Conjecture for the local projective plane. The proof relates the higher genus conifold Gromov-Witten generating series of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ to the thermodynamics of a certain statistical mechanical ensemble of repulsive particles on the positive half-line. As a corollary, this establishes the all-genus mirror principle for local $\mathbb{P}^2$ through the direct integration of the BCOV holomorphic anomaly equations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>Mass Varying Neutrino Oscillation in Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how matter density affects neutrino oscillations by considering a mass-varying neutrino scenario where the neutrino mass depends on a scalar field. This scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant, causing its profile to be implicitly influenced by the surrounding matter distribution. Using data from solar neutrino experiments, we derive constraints on the model parameters, providing new insights into the properties of mass-varying neutrino within the Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor framework.</description>

      <title>Do plasmoids induce fast magnetic reconnection in well-resolved current sheets in 2D MHD simulations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers $10^3 \le S \le 2 \times 10^5$. Although the tearing-mode instability is commonly thought to trigger a plasmoid cascade that enables fast reconnection - i.e., independent of $S$ - our results, in broad agreement with the recent findings of Morillo \&amp; Alexakis (2025), challenge this belief. We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \sim 10^4$. For larger values, plasmoid formation sets in leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity dependent, and therefore slow. In our simulations, the plasmoids do not form a cascade of mergers, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Our findings call for the revision of the role of plasmoid formation in 2D high Lundquist number magnetic reconnection. Even if future studies demonstrate that 2D plasmoid-reconnection becomes resistivity-independent at sufficiently large $S$, directly extending those results to 3D astrophysical environments is not justified, as in realistic circumstances, the increase of $S$ also raises the Reynolds number of the outflows, making it essential to account for the dominant role of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information matrices from R\'enyi relative entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</description>

      <title>From negative to positive cosmological constant through decreasing temperature of the Universe: connection with string theory and spacetime foliation results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String theories naturally predict a negative, while observations on the exponential expansion of the present Universe require a positive value for the cosmological constant. Solution to resolve this discrepancy is known in the framework of string theory however, it might describe unstable worlds. Other options include modified $\Lambda$CDM models with sign switching cosmological constant (known as $\Lambda_s$ cosmology), but the sign flip is introduced into the models manually. Additional studies consider Asymptotically Safe (AS) quantum gravity by using Renormalization Group (RG), however their disadvantage is the omission of temperature which is otherwise crucial in the early Universe. Here we present a proposal for resolving this conflict by using a modified thermal RG method where the temperature parameter $T$ is given by the inverse radius of the compactified time-like dimension, similarly to spacetime foliation. In our scenario not the dimensionful $T$, but the dimensionless temperature $\tau = T/k$ is kept constant when the RG scale $k$ is sent to zero and string theory is assumed to take place at very high while AS quantum gravity at intermediate and low temperatures. We show that the modified thermal RG study of AS quantum gravity models at very high temperatures results in a negative cosmological constant while turns it into a positive parameter for low temperatures.</description>

      <title>The Anholonomic Frame and Connection Deformation Method for constructing off-diagonal solutions in (modified) Einstein gravity and nonassociative geometric flows and Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is a status report on the Anholonomic Frame and Connection Deformation Method, AFCDM, for constructing generic off-diagonal exact and parametric solutions in general relativity, GR, relativistic geometric flows, and modified gravity theories, MGTs. Such models can be generalized to nonassociative and noncommutative star products on phase spaces and modelled equivalently as nonassociative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometries. Our approach involves a nonholonomic geometric reformulation of classical models of gravitational and matter fields described by Lagrange and Hamilton densities on relativistic phase spaces. Using nonholonomic dyadic variables, the Einstein equations in GR and MGTs can be formulated as systems of nonlinear partial differential equations(PDEs), which can be decoupled and integrated in some general off-diagonal forms. In this approach, the Lagrange and Hamilton dynamics and related models of classical and quantum evolution are equivalently described in terms of generalized Finsler-like or canonical metrics and (nonlinear) connection structures on deformed phase spaces defined by solutions of modified Einstein equations. New classes of exact and parametric solutions in (nonassociative) MGTs are formulated in terms of generating and integration functions and generating effective/ matter sources. The physical interpretation of respective classes of solutions depends on the type of (non) linear symmetries, prescribed boundary/ asymptotic conditions, or posed Cauchy problems.</description>
