      <title>Exact discovery is polynomial for sparse causal Bayesian networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal Bayesian networks are widely used tools for summarising the dependencies between variables and elucidating their putative causal relationships. Learning networks from data is computationally hard in general. The current state-of-the-art approaches for exact causal discovery are integer linear programming over the underlying space of directed acyclic graphs, dynamic programming and shortest-path searches over the space of topological orders, and constraint programming combining both. For dynamic programming over orders, the computational complexity is known to be exponential base 2 in the number of variables in the network. We demonstrate how to use properties of Bayesian networks to prune the search space and lower the computational cost, while still guaranteeing exact discovery. When including new path-search and divide-and-conquer criteria, we prove optimality in quadratic time for matchings, and polynomial time for any network class with logarithmically-bound largest connected components. In simulation studies we observe the polynomial dependence for sparse networks and that, beyond some critical value, the logarithm of the base grows with the network density. Our approach then out-competes the state-of-the-art at lower densities. These results therefore pave the way for faster exact causal discovery in larger and sparser networks.</description>

      <title>MSmix: An R Package for clustering partial rankings via mixtures of Mallows Models with Spearman distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MSmix is a recently developed R package implementing maximum likelihood estimation of finite mixtures of Mallows models with Spearman distance for full and partial rankings. The package is designed to implement computationally tractable estimation routines of the model parameters, with the ability to handle arbitrary forms of partial rankings and sequences of a large number of items. The frequentist estimation task is accomplished via EM algorithms, integrating data augmentation strategies to recover the unobserved heterogeneity and the missing ranks. The package also provides functionalities for uncertainty quantification of the estimated parameters, via diverse bootstrap methods and asymptotic confidence intervals. Generic methods for S3 class objects are constructed for more effectively managing the output of the main routines. The usefulness of the package and its computational performance compared with competing software is illustrated via applications to both simulated and original real ranking datasets.</description>

      <title>Fast sampling from constrained spaces using the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method called the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm for approximate sampling from distributions whose support is a compact and convex set. This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Testing Calibration in Nearly-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent literature on machine learning and decision making, calibration has emerged as a desirable and widely-studied statistical property of the outputs of binary prediction models. However, the algorithmic aspects of measuring model calibration have remained relatively less well-explored. Motivated by [BGHN23], which proposed a rigorous framework for measuring distances to calibration, we initiate the algorithmic study of calibration through the lens of property testing. We define the problem of calibration testing from samples where given $n$ draws from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on $(predictions, binary outcomes)$, our goal is to distinguish between the case where $\mathcal{D}$ is perfectly calibrated, and the case where $\mathcal{D}$ is $\varepsilon$-far from calibration.
  We make the simple observation that the empirical smooth calibration linear program can be reformulated as an instance of minimum-cost flow on a highly-structured graph, and design an exact dynamic programming-based solver for it which runs in time $O(n\log^2(n))$, and solves the calibration testing problem information-theoretically optimally in the same time. This improves upon state-of-the-art black-box linear program solvers requiring $\Omega(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega &gt; 2$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. We also develop algorithms for tolerant variants of our testing problem improving upon black-box linear program solvers, and give sample complexity lower bounds for alternative calibration measures to the one considered in this work. Finally, we present experiments showing the testing problem we define faithfully captures standard notions of calibration, and that our algorithms scale efficiently to accommodate large sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Simplifying debiased inference via automatic differentiation and probabilistic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that simplifies the construction of efficient estimators, making them accessible to a broader audience. 'Dimple' takes as input computer code representing a parameter of interest and outputs an efficient estimator. Unlike standard approaches, it does not require users to derive a functional derivative known as the efficient influence function. Dimple avoids this task by applying automatic differentiation to the statistical functional of interest. Doing so requires expressing this functional as a composition of primitives satisfying a novel differentiability condition. Dimple also uses this composition to determine the nuisances it must estimate. In software, primitives can be implemented independently of one another and reused across different estimation problems. We provide a proof-of-concept Python implementation and showcase through examples how it allows users to go from parameter specification to efficient estimation with just a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>Sharp detection of low-dimensional structure in probability measures via dimensional logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional probability measures is an essential pre-processing step for efficient sampling. We introduce a method for identifying and approximating a target measure $\pi$ as a perturbation of a given reference measure $\mu$ along a few significant directions of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The reference measure can be a Gaussian or a nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian, as commonly arising in generative modeling. Our method extends prior work on minimizing majorizations of the Kullback--Leibler divergence to identify optimal approximations within this class of measures. Our main contribution unveils a connection between the \emph{dimensional} logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and approximations with this ansatz. Specifically, when the target and reference are both Gaussian, we show that minimizing the dimensional LSI is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence restricted to this ansatz. For general non-Gaussian measures, the dimensional LSI produces majorants that uniformly improve on previous majorants for gradient-based dimension reduction. We further demonstrate the applicability of this analysis to the squared Hellinger distance, where analogous reasoning shows that the dimensional Poincar\'e inequality offers improved bounds.</description>
