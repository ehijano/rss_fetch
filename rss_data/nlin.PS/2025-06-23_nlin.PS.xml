      <title>Beating solitons with nonzero relative wavenumber, their interaction, and coexistence with Akhmediev breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study beating solitons and their interaction for the three-component nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLSEs) in both focusing and defocusing cases. We identify a previously unknown family of beating solitons with nonzero relative wavenumber which is absent in the two-component NLSEs. Existence diagrams of these beating solitons are extracted from the exact solutions. Unique coexistence and interaction between beating solitons and vector Akhmediev breathers are revealed by using the existence diagrams. It is demonstrated that the coexisting breathers turn out to be the two-component Akhmediev breathers with nonzero relative wavenumber. The validity of our exact solutions has been confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Saltatory targeting strategy in rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how strategic leaps alter the classic rock-paper-scissors dynamics in spatially structured populations. In our model, individuals can expend energy reserves to jump toward regions with a high density of individuals of the species they dominate in the spatial game. This enables them to eliminate the target organisms and gain new territory, promoting species proliferation. Through stochastic, lattice-based simulations, we show that even when the energy allocated to jumping, as opposed to random walking, is low, there is a significant shift in the cyclic dominance balance. This arises from the increased likelihood of the leaping species successfully acquiring territory. Due to the cyclical nature of the game, the dominant species becomes the one that is superior to the jumping species. We investigate how spatial patterns are affected and calculate the changes in characteristic length scales. Additionally, we quantify how saltatory targeting reshapes spatial correlations and drives shifts in population dominance. Finally, we estimate the coexistence probability and find evidence that this behavioural strategy may promote biodiversity among low-mobility organisms but jeopardise long-term coexistence in the case of high-mobility dispersal. These results underscore the profound impact of novel foraging tactics on community structure and provide concrete parameters for ecologists seeking to incorporate behavioural innovation into ecosystem models.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation as a Resilience Mechanism in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical and computational modelling in oncology has played an increasingly important role in not only understanding the impact of various approaches to treatment on tumour growth, but in optimizing dosing regimens and aiding the development of treatment strategies. However, as with all modelling, only an approximation is made in the description of the biological and physical system. Here we show that tissue-scale spatial structure can have a profound impact on the resilience of tumours to immunotherapy using a classical model incorporating IL-2 compounds and effector cells as treatment parameters. Using linear stability analysis, numerical continuation, and direct simulations, we show that diffusing cancer cell populations can undergo pattern-forming (Turing) instabilities, leading to spatially-structured states that persist far into treatment regimes where the corresponding spatially homogeneous systems would uniformly predict a cancer-free state. These spatially-patterned states persist in a wide range of parameters, as well as under time-dependent treatment regimes. Incorporating treatment via domain boundaries can increase this resistance to treatment in the interior of the domain, further highlighting the importance of spatial modelling when designing treatment protocols informed by mathematical models. Counter-intuitively, this mechanism shows that increased effector cell mobility can increase the resilience of tumours to treatment. We conclude by discussing practical and theoretical considerations for understanding this kind of spatial resilience in other models of cancer treatment, in particular those incorporating more realistic spatial transport.</description>
