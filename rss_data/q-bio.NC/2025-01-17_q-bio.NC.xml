      <title>A UDP Packet Format Establishing Adress Event Representation Communication Between Remote Neuromorphic and Biological Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of brain-machine interfaces, biohybrids offer an interesting new perspective, as in them, the technological side acts like a closed-loop extension or real counterpart of biological tissue, instead of the usual open loop approaches in tranditional BMI. To achieve a credible counterpart to biological tissue, biohybrids usually employ one or several neuromorphic components as the hardware half of the biohybrid. However, advanced neuromorphic circuit such as memristor crossbars usually operate best in a dedicated lab with corresponding support equipment. The same is true for biological tissue, which makes co-locating all of the parts of a biohybrid in the same lab challenging. Here, we present as solution to this co-location issue a simple method to connect biohybrids via the internet by a custom UDP packet format. We show that the characteristics achieved with our solution (jitter, delay, packet loss, packet reordering) on a standard internet connection are compatible with various biohybrid processing paradigms, and we present a short three-ways experiment as proof-of-concept. The described UDP format has been employed to link biohybrids and neuromorphic circuits in four different EC-funded projects.</description>

      <title>Causal Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity Prevents Assembly Fusion in Recurrent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The organization of neurons into functionally related assemblies is a fundamental feature of cortical networks, yet our understanding of how these assemblies maintain distinct identities while sharing members remains limited. Here we analyze how spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) shapes the formation and stability of overlapping neuronal assemblies in recurrently coupled networks of spiking neuron models. Using numerical simulations and an associated mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the temporal structure of the STDP rule, specifically its degree of causality, critically determines whether assemblies that share neurons maintain segregation or merge together after training is completed. We find that causal STDP rules, where potentiation/depression occurs strictly when presynaptic spikes precede/proceed postsynaptic spikes, allow assemblies to remain distinct even with substantial overlap in membership. This stability arises because causal STDP effectively cancels the symmetric correlations introduced by common inputs from shared neurons. In contrast, acausal STDP rules lead to assembly fusion when overlap exceeds a critical threshold, due to unchecked growth of common input correlations. Our results provide theoretical insight into how spike-timing-dependent learning rules can support distributed representation where individual neurons participate in multiple assemblies while maintaining functional specificity.</description>

      <title>Data mining the functional architecture of the brain's circuitry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain is a highly complex organ consisting of a myriad of subsystems that flexibly interact and adapt over time and context to enable perception, cognition, and behavior. Understanding the multi-scale nature of the brain, i.e., how circuit- and moleclular-level interactions build up the fundamental components of brain function, holds incredible potential for developing interventions for neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, as well as open new understanding into our very nature. Historically technological limitations have forced systems neuroscience to be local in anatomy (localized, small neural populations in single brain areas), in behavior (studying single tasks), in time (focusing on specific stages of learning or development), and in modality (focusing on imaging single biological quantities). New developments in neural recording technology and behavioral monitoring now provide the data needed to break free of local neuroscience to global neuroscience: i.e., understanding how the brain's many subsystem interact, adapt, and change across the multitude of behaviors animals and humans must perform to thrive. Specifically, while we have much knowledge of the anatomical architecture of the brain (i.e., the hardware), we finally are approaching the data needed to find the functional architecture and discover the fundamental properties of the software that runs on the hardware. We must take this opportunity to bridge between the vast amounts of data to discover this functional architecture which will face numerous challenges from low-level data alignment up to high level questions of interpretable mathematical models of behavior that can synthesize the myriad of datasets together.</description>

      <title>A unified model for the origins of spongiform degeneration and other neuropathological features in prion diseases</title>

Abstract: Decades after their initial observation in prion-infected brain tissues, the identities of virus-like dense particles, varicose tubules, and oval bodies containing parallel bands and fibrils have remained elusive. Our recent work revealed that a phenotype of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), most notable for the perinuclear space (PNS), contributes to spongiform degeneration. To assess the significance of this phenotype for the etiology of prion diseases, we explored whether it can be functionally linked to other neuropathological hallmarks observed in these diseases, as this would indicate it to be a central event. Having surveyed the neuropathological record and other distant literature niches, we propose a model in which pathogenic forms of the prion protein poison raft domains, including essential Na+, K+-ATPases (NKAs) embedded within them, thereby triggering an ER-centered cellular rescue program coordinated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). The execution of this program stalls general protein synthesis, causing the deterioration of synaptic spines. As the disease progresses, cells selectively increase sterol biosynthesis, along with ribosome and ER biogenesis. These adaptive rescue attempts cause morphological changes to the ER which manifest as ER dilation or ER hypertrophy in a manner that is influenced by Ca2+ influx into the cell. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport of mRNAs and tRNAs interrupts in late stage disease, thereby depriving ribosomes of supplies and inducing them to aggregate into a paracrystalline form. In support of this model, we share previously reported data, whose features are consistent with the interpretation that 1) the phenotype of ER dilation is observed in major prion diseases, 2) varicose tubules and oval bodies represent ER hypertrophy, and 3) virus-like dense particles are paracrystalline aggregates of inactive ribosomes.</description>

      <title>Flexible task abstractions emerge in linear networks with fast and bounded units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animals survive in dynamic environments changing at arbitrary timescales, but such data distribution shifts are a challenge to neural networks. To adapt to change, neural systems may change a large number of parameters, which is a slow process involving forgetting past information. In contrast, animals leverage distribution changes to segment their stream of experience into tasks and associate them with internal task abstracts. Animals can then respond flexibly by selecting the appropriate task abstraction. However, how such flexible task abstractions may arise in neural systems remains unknown. Here, we analyze a linear gated network where the weights and gates are jointly optimized via gradient descent, but with neuron-like constraints on the gates including a faster timescale, nonnegativity, and bounded activity. We observe that the weights self-organize into modules specialized for tasks or sub-tasks encountered, while the gates layer forms unique representations that switch the appropriate weight modules (task abstractions). We analytically reduce the learning dynamics to an effective eigenspace, revealing a virtuous cycle: fast adapting gates drive weight specialization by protecting previous knowledge, while weight specialization in turn increases the update rate of the gating layer. Task switching in the gating layer accelerates as a function of curriculum block size and task training, mirroring key findings in cognitive neuroscience. We show that the discovered task abstractions support generalization through both task and subtask composition, and we extend our findings to a non-linear network switching between two tasks. Overall, our work offers a theory of cognitive flexibility in animals as arising from joint gradient descent on synaptic and neural gating in a neural network architecture.</description>
