      <title>A Quantum Approach for Optimal Transient Control in Network-Based Epidemic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective epidemic control is crucial for mitigating the spread of infectious diseases, particularly when pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines or treatments are limited. Non-pharmaceutical strategies, including mobility restrictions, are key in reducing transmission rates but require careful optimization to balance public health benefits and socioeconomic costs. Quantum computing is emerging as a powerful tool for solving complex optimization problems that are intractable for classical methods and can thus be leveraged to handle mobility restrictions. This article presents a new approach to optimizing epidemic control strategies using quantum computing techniques. We focus on non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly mobility restriction, modeled as a discrete-time network epidemic process based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible and susceptible-infected-removed frameworks. The control problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization task, inherently NP-hard due to the binary nature of intervention decisions. To tackle this computational complexity, we derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization representation of the control problem, enabling its efficient solution via quantum computing resources. Our methodology is validated through numerical simulations on realistic case studies, showcasing the potential of quantum algorithms for enhancing epidemic control strategies. These findings pave the way for leveraging quantum optimization in broader applications of networked dynamical systems, demonstrating its viability for complex decision-making processes in public health management.</description>

      <title>Unbeatable imitation of a friend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation sometimes achieves success in multi-agent situations even though it is very simple. In game theory, success of imitation has been characterized by unbeatability against other agents. Previous studies specified conditions under which imitation is unbeatable in repeated games, and clarified that the existence of unbeatable imitation is strongly related to the existence of payoff-controlling strategies, called zero-determinant strategies. However, the previous studies mainly focused on ``imitation of opponents''. It was pointed out that imitation of other players in the same group and imitation of other players in the same role in other groups generally result in different outcomes. Here, we investigate the existence condition of unbeatable imitation in the latter ``imitation of friends'' situations. We find that it is stronger than the existence condition of unbeatable zero-determinant strategies, whereas both are very limited. Our findings suggest a strong relation between them even in the `imitation of friends'' situations.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of coupled sociopolitical events-planetary boundaries, crises, policrisis and Earth System syndromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of the human activities can be evaluated by the Planetary Boundaries (PBs), however, so far it is not clear how to assess the influence of specific sociopolitical events (SPEs) on the Earth System (ES) and at the same measure, without a suitable framework, to gauge how these affect the PBs. In this work, we propose an interacting matrix model that couples SPEs with the PBs and consider the possible evolution scenarios and, in particular, those leading to crises and policrisis. We address specifically the situation where the PBs evolve according to the continuous logistic function, and then consider an exponentially-evolving SPE, which we show to cause a runaway effect on the PBs. We also propose a way to describe, classify, and compare sociopolitical syndromes, that is, a set composed of more than a single polycrisis.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Space RG Theory Based on Universal Scaling Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale-free networks -- from the Internet to biological systems -- exhibit hierarchical organization that resists conventional renormalization group (RG) analysis. Their combination of scale invariance and small-world connectivity challenges standard RG methods, which rely on well-defined length scales. We resolve this challenge by formulating a spectral-space RG framework that captures both structural and dynamical scaling in complex networks. Leveraging the Laplacian eigenspectrum, we implement coarse-graining transformations unconstrained by geometry. This yields universal scaling relations connecting fractal dimensions, spectral dimensions, and degree exponents, establishing the first systematic foundation for network renormalization. A novel meta-graph reconstruction algorithm enables direct extraction of renormalized topologies from spectral data. We validate our predictions across diverse real-world networks and uncover new phenomena: evolving networks display multi-scaling behavior indicative of structural transitions, and spectral non-recursiveness reveals hidden dynamical correlations invisible in static topology. Applied to the European power grid, our method identifies latent connections between distant regions, consistent with observed fault propagation. Our results position spectral-space renormalization as a unified framework for analyzing scale-invariant networks, with broad implications for network science, infrastructure resilience, and statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Constructing the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow from large-scale vehicle trajectory data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, researchers and practitioners typically measure macroscopic traffic flow variables, i.e., density, flow, and speed, using time or space cuts, and then construct the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow. With the advent of large-scale vehicle trajectory datasets, often capturing 100 % of vehicle dynamics, Edie's generalized definitions have become widely recognized as the most appropriate framework for measuring these variables. However, while Edie's formulation explicitly requires the traffic state within the measurement region to be both stationary and homogeneous, there is little guidance on how to systematically identify such qualified regions and construct the corresponding fundamental diagrams. To address this gap, this paper proposes an Edie's definition-based method for measuring traffic variables and constructing the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow by automatically identifying stationary traffic states using parallelogram-shaped aggregation regions. An open-source tool is developed and released to support both researchers and practitioners. From now on, we have an automated tool that can generate fundamental diagrams directly from any large-scale time-space diagram of vehicle trajectories, either collected from the real world or generated by simulation (such as testing car-following models).</description>

      <title>Inference accuracy about an aircraft crash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problem-based learning benefits from situations taken from real life, which arouse student interest. The shooting of Rwanda president aircraft on April 6th, 1994 is still unsolved. We discuss the methods to infer information and conclusions about where the aircraft was shot and its trajectory during its fall, as well as about the place from which the missiles were launched, and their trajectory and type. To this goal, we compiled expert reports, witness indications and other public sources, then translated plain language sentences into quantitative equalities and inequalities applied to geometry and mechanics at undergraduate level. The accuracy of each result is discussed and propagated in order to ensure a proper assessment of the hypotheses and a traceability of their consequences. Overall, the accuracy discussion can train the students critical mind, and teach inference methods which are routinely used in several fields of physics research. In addition, it demonstrates the importance and limits of scientific expertise during a judiciary process. The publicly available information interpreted by our calculations shows that the question of missile launching position is still open.</description>

      <title>Why We Experience Society Differently: Intrinsic Dispositions as Drivers of Ideological Complexity in Adaptive Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of inequality in complex systems requires attention to both structural dynamics and intrinsic heterogeneity. In the context of opinion dynamics, traditional models relied on static snapshots or assumed homogeneous agent behavior, overlooking how diverse cognitive dispositions shape belief evolution. While some recent models introduce behavioral heterogeneity, they typically focus on macro-level patterns, neglecting the unequal and individualized dynamics that unfold at the agent level. In this study, we analyze an adaptive social network model where each agent exhibits one of three behavioral tendencies-homophily, neophily (attention to novelty), or social conformity-and measure the complexity of individual opinion trajectories using normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. We find that the resulting dynamics are often counterintuitive-homophilic agents, despite seeking similarity, become increasingly unpredictable; neophilic agents, despite pursuing novelty, stabilize; and conformic agents follow a U-shaped trajectory, transitioning from early stability to later unpredictability. More fundamentally, these patterns remain robust across diverse network settings, showing that internal behavioral dispositions - not external environment - primarily govern long-term opinion unpredictability. The broader implication is that individuals' experiences of ideological volatility, uncertainty, or stability are not merely environmental, but endogenously self-structured through their own cognitive tendencies. These results establish a novel individual-level lens on opinion dynamics, where the behavioral identity of agents serves as a dynamical fingerprint in the evolution of belief systems, and gives rise to persistent disparities in dynamical experience within self-organizing social systems, even in structurally similar environments.</description>
