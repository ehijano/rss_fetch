      <title>The resummation model in FLAMINGO: precisely predicting matter power suppression from observed halo baryon fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to derive unbiased cosmological parameters from Stage-IV surveys, we need models that can predict the matter power spectrum for at least $k\,\lesssim\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with percent-level precision. The main challenge in this endeavour is that baryonic feedback significantly redistributes matter on large scales, but to an unknown degree. Here, we present an improved version of the "resummation" model, which maps observed halo baryon fractions of massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{500c}}\gtrsim 10^{12.5}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) to a flexible suppression signal - i.e. the ratio of baryonic to dark-matter-only (DMO) matter power spectra - using zero free parameters. We apply this model to the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, obtaining a typical precision of $\lesssim 1\%$ for $k\,\leq\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ given mean halo baryon fractions within the spherical overdensity radii $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{200m}}$. When only those within $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ are available, we still obtain $\lesssim 2\%$ precision. We show that given small-scale stellar mass fractions, the model can be extended to yield $\lesssim 3\%$ precise suppression signals for all scales measured ($k\,\leq\,25\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$). We also extend the model to redshifts $z&gt;0$. Central to the model is a seemingly mass-independent and feedback-independent relation that allows observed halo masses to be mapped to equivalent DMO halo masses using only observed mean halo baryon fractions, to $\lesssim 1\%$ precision. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to retrieve the DMO halo mass function from observed halo masses and baryon fractions with percent-level precision, without any assumptions on the strength of feedback. A Python package implementing the resummation model is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>An emulator-based forecasting on astrophysics and cosmology with 21 cm and density cross-correlations during EoR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21 cm signal arising from fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen field, and its cross-correlation with other tracers of cosmic density, are promising probes of the high-redshift Universe. In this study, we assess the potential of the 21 cm power spectrum, along with its cross power spectrum with dark matter density and associated bias, to constrain both astrophysics during the reionization era and the underlying cosmology. Our methodology involves emulating these estimators using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space. Utilizing a photon-conserving semi-numerical reionization model, we construct emulators at a fixed redshift ($z = 7.0$) for $k$-modes relevant to upcoming telescopes such as SKA-Low. We generate $\sim7000$ training samples by varying both cosmological and astrophysical parameters along with initial conditions, achieving high accuracy when compared to true simulation outputs. While forecasting, the model involves five free parameters: three cosmological ($\Omega_m$, $h$, $\sigma_8$) and two astrophysical (ionizing efficiency, $\zeta$, and minimum halo mass, $M_{\mathrm{min}}$). Using a fiducial model at the mid-reionization stage, we create a mock dataset and perform forecasting with the trained emulators. Assuming a 5% observational uncertainty combined with emulator error, we find that the 21 cm and 21 cm-density cross power spectra can constrain the Hubble parameter ($h$) to better than 6% at a confidence interval of 95%, with tight constraints on the global neutral fraction ($Q_{\mathrm{HI}}$). The inclusion of bias information further improves constraints on $\sigma_8$ (&lt; 10% at 95% confidence). Finally, robustness tests with two alternate ionization states and a variant with higher observational uncertainty show that the ionization fractions are still reliably recovered, even when cosmological constraints weaken.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation with gradient interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation rests on the separate-universe approximation, i.e. the ability to describe long-wavelength fluctuations in an inflating universe as homogeneous perturbations of its background dynamics. Although this approximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it breaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor phases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to enhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial black holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in such models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of backreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how gradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of Langevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases of interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the classical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from cosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered. We uncover the existence of a "pullback" effect by which the tails of the first-passage-time distributions are dampened by gradient interactions. We finally discuss the role of backreaction in the presence of gradient interactions.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity from early-time thermalization of cosmic fluids in light of DESI DR2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If nonrelativistic dark matter and radiation are allowed to interact, reaching an approximate thermal equilibrium, this interaction induces a bulk viscous pressure changing the effective one-fluid description of the universe dynamics. By modeling such components as perfect fluids, a cosmologically relevant bulk viscous pressure emerges for dark matter particle masses in the range of $1\,\text{eV} - 10\,\text{eV}$ keeping thermal equilibrium with the radiation. Such a transient bulk viscosity introduces significant effects in the expansion rate near the matter-radiation equality (redshift $z_{\text{eq}} \sim 3400$) and at late times (leading to a higher inferred value of the Hubble constant $H_0$). We use the recent DESI DR2 BAO data to place an upper bound on the free parameter of the model $\tau_\text{eq}$ which represents the time scale in which each component follows its own internal perfect fluid dynamics until thermalization occurs. Our main result is encoded in the bound $\tau_\text{eq} &lt; 1.84 \times 10^{-10} $ s (2$\sigma$), with the corresponding dimensionless bulk coefficient $\tilde{\xi} H_0/H_{eq}&lt;5.94\times10^{-4}$ (2$\sigma$). In practice, this rules out any possible interaction between radiation and dark matter prior to the recombination epoch.</description>

      <title>Deep-Field Analytical Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of imaging surveys, including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Euclid, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, will place unprecedented constraints on cosmology using weak gravitational lensing. To fully exploit their statistical power, shear measurement methods must achieve sub-percent accuracy while mitigating systematic biases from noise, the point-spread function (PSF), blending, and shear-dependent detection. The analytical calibration framework (\texttt{AnaCal}) has demonstrated such accuracy but requires adding noise to images, reducing their effective depth. We introduce Deep-Field Analytical Calibration (\textsc{deep-field~}\texttt{AnaCal}), an extension of \texttt{AnaCal} that leverages deep-field images to compute shear responses while preserving wide-field statistical power. We validate the method on isolated and blended galaxy simulations with LSST-like seeing and noise, showing it meets the stringent requirement of multiplicative bias $|m| &lt; 3\times10^{-3}$ at 99.7% confidence. Relative to standard \texttt{AnaCal} on wide-field images, this method improves effective galaxy number density from $17$ to $30$ arcmin$^{-2}$ for simulated 10-year LSST data. Assuming deep fields with $10\times$ the exposure of wide fields, we find the pixel noise variance in shear estimation is reduced by $30%$ and the overall shear uncertainty by $\sim 25%$. Finally, we assess sample variance impacts using the LSST Deep Drilling Fields strategy, finding an equivalent calibration uncertainty of $\lesssim 0.3%$. These results establish \textsc{deep-field~}\texttt{AnaCal} as a promising approach for shear calibration in upcoming weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Efficient evaluation of the dark-matter two-loop power spectrum in the EFT of LSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in cosmological Large Scale Structure (LSS) surveys motivates precise theoretical predictions. The Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) is routinely applied to data, and requires fast computation of its predictions when sampling the large space of cosmological parameters. Going beyond existing one-loop techniques, we present a method to rapidly evaluate the two-loop power spectrum. Our method decomposes the typically small difference between a given linear power spectrum and a reference power spectrum into a cosmology-independent basis of functions resembling massive scalar propagators in Quantum Field Theory. By taking the leading terms in such a small difference, we numerically evaluate the cosmology-independent loop integrals where in the integrand only the relevant combinations of basis functions appear. We achieve an efficient numerical evaluation via physically motivated local ultraviolet subtractions and by arranging the cancellation of infrared singularities locally in the integrands. Final predictions are obtained by contracting these precomputed integrals with the cosmology-dependent coordinates of the expansion in the fixed basis. We present and publicly release the precomputed integrals for the renormalized two-loop dark-matter power spectrum in the EFTofLSS. These require eight EFT counterterms, which include the effect of generated vorticity, and are sufficient to analyze the lensing galaxy signal in LSS surveys at this order.</description>

      <title>Prominence: A discriminator of gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of prominence is familiar to signal engineers, topographers and mountaineers. We introduce Prominence $\mathcal P$ as a discriminator of gravitational wave (GW) signals. We treat black hole and neutron star binaries as astrophysical background sources, and show how $\mathcal P$ can be used to distinguish between GW spectra produced by first-order phase transitions, domain walls and cosmic strings, and combinations thereof. Prominence can also be used to discriminate between these and off-piste sources of GWs. The uncertainty in the measured energy density in GWs at Pulsar Timing Arrays needs to be smaller than $\sim 4\%$ for $\mathcal{P}$ to achieve discrimination at 3$\sigma$. LISA and ET data are expected to have sufficiently small uncertainties that Prominence can play a central role in their analysis.</description>

      <title>II. Non-Linear Interacting Dark Energy: Analytical Solutions and Theoretical Pathologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate interacting dark energy (IDE) models with phenomenological, non-linear interaction kernels $Q$, specifically $Q_{1}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm dm}\rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, $Q_{2}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, and $Q_{3}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$. Using dynamical system techniques developed in our companion paper on linear kernels, we derive new conditions that ensure positive and well-defined energy densities, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We find that for $Q_{1}$, all densities remain positive, while for $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ negative values of either DM or DE are unavoidable if energy flows from DM to DE. We also show that for $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ a big rip singularity always arises in the phantom regime $w&lt;-1$, whereas for $Q_{3}$ this fate may be avoided if energy flows from DE to DM. In addition, we provide new exact analytical solutions for $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$ in the cases of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$, and obtain new expressions for the effective equations of state of DM, DE, the total fluid, and the reconstructed dynamical DE equation of state ($w_{\rm dm}^{\rm eff}$, $w_{\rm de}^{\rm eff}$, $w_{\rm tot}^{\rm eff}$, and $\tilde{w}$). Using these results, we discuss phantom crossings, evaluate how each kernel addresses the coincidence problem, and apply statefinder diagnostics to compare the models. These findings extend the theoretical understanding of non-linear IDE models and provide analytical tools for future observational constraints.</description>

      <title>I. Linear Interacting Dark Energy: Analytical Solutions and Theoretical Pathologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting dark energy (IDE) models, in which dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) exchange energy through a non-gravitational interaction, have long been proposed as candidates to address key challenges in modern cosmology. These include the coincidence problem, the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, and, more recently, the hints of dynamical dark energy reported by the DESI collaboration. Given the renewed interest in IDE models, it is crucial to fully understand their parameter space when constraining them observationally, especially with regard to the often-neglected issues of negative energy densities and future big rip singularities. In this work, we present a comparative study of the general linear interaction $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm}\rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de}\rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$. For these five models, we perform a dynamical system analysis and derive new conditions that ensure positive, real, and well-defined energy densities throughout cosmic evolution, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We obtain exact analytical solutions for $\rho_{\rm{dm}}$, $\rho_{\rm{de}}$, the effective equations of state ($w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{dm}}$, $w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{de}}$, $w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{tot}}$), and a reconstructed dynamical DE equation of state $\tilde{w}$. Using these results, we examine phantom crossings, address the coincidence problem, and apply the statefinder diagnostic to distinguish between models. We show that energy transfer from DM to DE inevitably produces negative energy densities and make future singularities more likely, while transfer from DE to DM avoids these pathologies and is thus theoretically favored.</description>

      <title>III. Interacting Dark Energy: Summary of Models, Pathologies, and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an overview of the main results from our two companion papers that are relevant for observational constraints on interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We provide analytical solutions for the dark matter and dark energy densities, $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$, as well as the normalized Hubble function $h(z)$, for eight IDE models. These include five linear IDE models, namely $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de} \rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$, together with three non-linear IDE models: $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, and $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$. For these eight models, we present conditions to avoid imaginary, undefined, and negative energy densities. In seven of the eight cases, negative densities arise if energy flows from DM to DE, implying a strong theoretical preference for energy transfer from DE to DM. We also provide conditions to avoid future big rip singularities and evaluate how each model addresses the coincidence problem in both the past and the future. Finally, we propose a set of approaches and simplifying assumptions that can be used when constraining IDE models, by defining regimes that restrict the parameter space according to the behavior researchers are willing to tolerate.</description>

      <title>Identifying Microlensing by Compact Dark Matter through Diffraction Patterns in Gravitational Waves with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave lensing, particularly microlensing by compact dark matter (DM), offers a unique avenue to probe the nature of dark matter. However, conventional detection methods are often computationally expensive, inefficient, and sensitive to waveform systematics. In this work, we introduce the Wavelet Convolution Detector (WCD), a deep learning framework specifically designed to identify wave-optics diffraction patterns imprinted in gravitationally lensed signals. The WCD integrates multi-scale wavelet analysis within residual convolutional blocks to efficiently extract time-frequency interference structures, and is trained on a realistically generated dataset incorporating compact DM mass functions and astrophysical lensing probabilities. This work is the first machine learning-based approach capable of identifying such wave-optics signatures in lensed gravitational waves. Tested on simulated binary black hole events, the model achieves 92.2\% accuracy (AUC=0.965), with performance rising to AUC$\sim$0.99 at high SNR. Crucially, it maintains high discriminative power across a wide range of lens masses without retraining, demonstrating particular strength in the low-impact-parameter and high-lens-mass regimes where wave-optics effects are most pronounced. Compared to Bayesian inference, the WCD provides orders-of-magnitude faster inference, making it a scalable and efficient tool for discovering compact DM through lensed gravitational waves in the era of third-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Wide binaries in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy: discovery, population modeling, and a nail in the coffin of primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Bo\"{o}tes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\rm M_\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\pm0.25\%$ of Bo\"{o}tes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \gtrsim 5~{\rm M_\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\sim1\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Genesis--Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-singular cosmological scenario within the framework of Horndeski gravity, consisting of three successive stages: (i) a Genesis phase, in which the Universe slowly expands from an asymptotically flat spacetime; (ii) a brief transition stage restoring General Relativity; and (iii) a Starobinsky inflationary phase. This construction is fully consistent within a viable parameter space: it remains weakly coupled, free from ghost and gradient instabilities, with luminal tensor and subluminal scalar perturbations throughout the entire evolution. Importantly, the Genesis phase induces characteristic corrections to the Starobinsky potential, which cannot be captured by simple $\sum_i c_i R^i$-type modifications. These corrections robustly enhance the scalar spectral index, thereby improving the agreement of Starobinsky inflation with recent CMB measurements, in particular the data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems perspective on the thermodynamics of late-time cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A thermodynamic description of cosmological spacetimes may provide insights into the fundamentals of the cosmic evolution that remain otherwise obscure, in close analogy with 'black hole thermodynamics'. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of late-time cosmological evolution using the dynamical systems approach, focusing on the $\Lambda$CDM model and quintessence models with an exponential potential. Thermodynamic quantities obtained through the Hayward-Kodama formalism are mapped onto the phase space of these models, allowing us to investigate thermodynamic stability and phase transitions in a manner independent of the initial condition of the evolution of the universe. In both models, the universe inevitably undergoes a thermodynamic phase transition, marked by diverging specific heats, irrespective of its initial configuration. We further demonstrate that the thermodynamic stability can occur only during an accelerating phase of the universe. However, the necessary stability conditions are never satisfied anywhere in the phase space, rendering both models inherently thermodynamically unstable within the Hayward-Kodama framework. Importantly, our analysis highlights the dynamical system approach as a natural and powerful framework to probe the thermodynamic aspects of cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Unique gravitational wave signatures of GLPV scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves induced by scalar primordial fluctuations in Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV), beyond Horndeski, scalar-tensor theories. We uncover, at the level of the action, a new scalar-scalar-tensor interaction, unique to GLPV models disconnected from Horndeski via disformal transformation. The new interaction leads to third derivatives in the source for scalar-induced tensor modes, which are absent in Horndeski-related theories. Such new higher-derivative terms lead to a further enhanced production of induced gravitational waves. We predict that for a scale-invariant primordial spectrum, the induced gravitational wave spectral density has a characteristic frequency dependence proportional to $f^5$. Such a fast-rising spectrum offers a potential unique signature of modified gravity in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Searching for a Dark Dimension Right-handed Neutrino in KATRIN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility that the Right-handed neutrino is a five-dimensional state propagating along a micron size extra dimension, as required in the dark dimension proposal. We work out the signatures of R-neutrino production in KATRIN experiment and compare them with those of a sterile neutrino which manifests by a kink in the electron energy spectrum of the beta-decay at a value corresponding to the sterile neutrino mass. We explore the allowed parameter space of the compactification scale and the R-neutrino bulk mass versus the Yukawa coupling, and show that a large part of it is within KATRIN's sensitivity. When the bulk mass is much smaller than the compactification scale, several kinks could be observed corresponding to the positions of the R-neutrino Kaluza-Klein excitations, while for large bulk mass there will be effectively one kink at the position of the bulk mass.</description>

      <title>Forecasts for Broadband Intensity Mapping of the Ultraviolet-Optical Background with CASTOR and SPHEREx</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.00017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broadband tomography statistically extracts the redshift distribution of frequency dependent emission from the cross correlation of intensity maps with a reference catalog of galaxy tracers. We make forecasts for the performance of future all-sky UV experiments doing broadband tomography. We consider the Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical-UV Research (CASTOR) and the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx). The dominant uncertainty is from variability in the photometric zero point, which scales with limiting magnitude and so mirror size. With this scaling, and assuming a galaxy number density characteristic of future spectroscopic datasets, we find that CASTOR measures the UV background SED $2-10$ times better than existing data. The applicable redshift range will expand from the current $z &lt; 1$ to $z \approx 0-3$ with CASTOR and $z =5-9$ with SPHEREx. We show that CASTOR can provide competitive constraints on the EBL monopole to those available from galaxy number counts and direct measurement techniques. At high redshift especially, these results will help understand galaxy formation and reionization. Our modelling code and chains are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Second-order Gravitational Waves in Axion-like Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a hybrid inflation model driven by an axion-like particle (ALP) $\phi$. The model predicts a spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.964$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.003$, in agreement with Planck data and potentially testable by next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. We find that the PBH mass and the peak of the associated scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) spectrum are correlated with the ALP mass. In particular, PBHs in the mass range $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ can constitute either the entire dark matter (DM) content of the universe or a significant fraction of it. The predicted second-order GWs from this mechanism are within the sensitivity reach of future observatories like LISA and ET. The typical reheating temperature in the model is around $10^6 - 10^7$ GeV is consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints.</description>

      <title>Analytical and EZmock covariance validation for the DESI 2024 results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12027v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of uncertainties in cosmological parameters is an important challenge in Large-Scale-Structure (LSS) analyses. For standard analyses such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Full Shape, two approaches are usually considered. First: analytical estimates of the covariance matrix use Gaussian approximations and (nonlinear) clustering measurements to estimate the matrix, which allows a relatively fast and computationally cheap way to generate matrices that adapt to an arbitrary clustering measurement. On the other hand, sample covariances are an empirical estimate of the matrix based on en ensemble of clustering measurements from fast and approximate simulations. While more computationally expensive due to the large amount of simulations and volume required, these allow us to take into account systematics that are impossible to model analytically. In this work we compare these two approaches in order to enable DESI's key analyses. We find that the configuration space analytical estimate performs satisfactorily in BAO analyses and its flexibility in terms of input clustering makes it the fiducial choice for DESI's 2024 BAO analysis. On the contrary, the analytical computation of the covariance matrix in Fourier space does not reproduce the expected measurements in terms of Full Shape analyses, which motivates the use of a corrected mock covariance for DESI's Full Shape analysis.</description>

      <title>An ALMA spectroscopic survey of the Planck high-redshift object PLCK G073.4-57.5 confirms two protoclusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planck's High-Frequency Instrument observed the whole sky between 350um and 3mm, discovering thousands of unresolved peaks in the cosmic infrared background. The nature of these peaks is still poorly understood - while some are strong gravitational lenses, the majority are overdensities of star-forming galaxies but with almost no redshift constraints. PLCK G073.4-57.5 (G073) is one of these Planck-selected peaks. ALMA observations of G073 suggest the presence of two structures between z=1.5 and 2 aligned along the line of sight, but without spectroscopic confirmation. Characterizing the full redshift distribution of the galaxies within G073 is needed in order to better understand this representative example of Planck-selected objects, and connect them to the emergence of galaxy clusters. We used ALMA Band 4 spectral scans to search for CO(3-2), CO(4-3), and CI(1-0) line emission, targeting eight red Herschel-SPIRE sources in the field, as well as four bright SCUBA-2 sources. We find 15 emission lines in 13 galaxies, and using existing photometry, we determined the spectroscopic redshift of all 13 galaxies. Eleven of these galaxies are SPIRE-selected and lie in two structures at &lt;z&gt;=1.53 and &lt;z&gt;=2.31, while the two SCUBA-2-selected galaxies are at z=2.61. Using multi-wavelength photometry we constrained stellar masses and star formation rates, and using the CO and CI emission lines we constrained gas masses. Our protocluster galaxies exhibit typical gas depletion timescales for field galaxies at the same redshifts but higher gas-to-stellar mass ratios, potentially driven by emission line selection effects. The two structures are reproduced in cosmological simulations of star-forming halos at high redshifts; the simulated halos have a 60-70% probability of collapsing into galaxy clusters, implying that the two structures in G073 are genuinely protoclusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave or fuzzy dark matter produced with high momenta behaves in many ways like hot particle dark matter while also possessing seemingly different phenomenology due to wave interference. We develop wave perturbation theory to show that white noise density fluctuations generated by the interference of high-momenta waves are gravitationally unstable in the usual way during matter domination above the free streaming scale and stabilize below the free streaming scale, much like the analogous effects for massive neutrinos in hot dark matter. We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power spectra of Newtonian Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. In the cosmological context, this would cause a gradual suppression of the initial white noise isocurvature perturbations below the free streaming scale at matter radiation equality, unlike cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations, and virial stability of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Evolution of CIV Absorbers at $1.4&lt;z&lt;4.5$: Insights from $100,000$ Systems in DESI Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the largest catalog to date of triply ionized carbon (CIV) absorbers detected in quasar spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Using an automated matched-kernel convolution method with adaptive signal-to-noise thresholds, we identify $101,487$ CIV systems in the redshift range $1.4 &lt; z &lt; 4.5$ from $300,637$ quasar spectra. Completeness is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations and catalog is $50\%$ complete at $\mathrm{EW}_{\mathrm{CIV}} \geq 0.4$ Angstroms. The differential equivalent width frequency distribution declines exponentially and shows weak redshift evolution. The absorber incidence per unit comoving path increases by a factor of $2-5$ from $z \approx 4.5$ to $z \approx 1.4$, with stronger redshift evolution for strong systems. Using column densities derived from the apparent optical depth method, we constrain the cosmic mass density of CIV, $\Omega_{\mathrm{CIV}}$, which increases by a factor of $\sim 3.8$ from $(0.82 \pm 0.05) \times 10^{-8}$ at $z \approx 4.5$ to $(3.16 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-8}$ at $z \approx 1.4$. From $\Omega_{\rm CIV}$, we estimate a lower limit on intergalactic medium metallicity $\log(Z_{\rm IGM}/Z_{\odot}) \gtrsim -3.25$ at $z \sim 2.3$, with a smooth decline at higher redshifts. These trends trace the cosmic star formation history and HeII photoheating rate, suggesting a link between CIV enrichment, star formation, and UV background over $\sim 3$ Gyr. The catalog also provides a critical resource for future studies connecting circumgalactic metals to galaxy evolution, especially near cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>GrAviPaSt's Lens to the Past: Unveiling the Evolution of Filamentary Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshifts 1, 0.5, and 0 using the IllustrisTNG100-1 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. To achieve this, we introduce GrAviPaSt, a simple, efficient and parameter-free filament identification method that leverages gravitational potential, an A*-like path-finding algorithm, and spanning trees. Applying this method to galaxy distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift 1 to 0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton.</description>

      <title>Unified Lagrangian Framework for Galaxy Clustering: Consistent Modeling of Bias, Redshift-Space Distortions, and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present \emph{Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory} (ULPT), a perturbative framework for consistently modeling galaxy density fluctuations across real space, redshift space, and post-reconstruction fields. Unlike existing approaches that treat these cases separately, ULPT provides a single theoretical structure that incorporates the three essential coordinate mappings: the Lagrangian-to-Eulerian transformation, the real-to-redshift mapping induced by peculiar velocities, and the remapping from pre to post reconstruction. A key feature of our formulation is the explicit decomposition of the density field into two physically distinct components: the \emph{Jacobian deviation}, which encodes intrinsic linear and nonlinear growth, and the \emph{displacement-mapping effect}, which captures large-scale convective distortions. This separation enables a fully analytic and infrared (IR)-safe resummation, ensuring exact IR cancellation, a consistent Gaussian description of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping, and the correct residual structure in cross spectra between fields with distinct IR behavior. The perturbative expansion of ULPT naturally generates Galileon-type operators, thereby providing a compact and physically motivated operator basis for nonlinear and nonlocal Lagrangian bias, and allowing for a renormalization-free treatment of biased tracers. Within this framework, we derive a unified expression for the power spectrum that applies equally to dark matter, biased tracers, redshift-space distortions, and reconstructed fields. ULPT thus offers a robust and extensible foundation for precision modeling of large-scale structure, with potential extensions to higher-order statistics, such as the bispectrum, and to other two-point observables, such as galaxy--galaxy lensing.</description>

      <title>Reading signatures of supermassive binary black holes in pulsar timing array observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the inferred properties of the putative gravitational wave background in the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array to be in better agreement with theoretical expectations under the improved noise model. In particular, our improved noise models show consistency of the background's strain spectral index with the value of -2/3, favoring the population of supermassive black hole binaries as the origin of the background. Our results further suggest that the observed gravitational wave emission is the dominant source of the binary energy loss, with no evidence of environmental effects or eccentric orbits. At the reference gravitational wave frequency of yr$^{-1}$, we also find a lower power-law strain amplitude of the background than in previous data analyses. This mitigates some of the tensions of the strain amplitude with the expected number density and mass scale of binaries discussed in the literature. However, we show that it is mostly affected by strong covariance of the amplitude and the strain spectral index at yr$^{-1}$, whereas the strain amplitude at 0.1 yr$^{-1}$ and the strain amplitude at yr$^{-1}$ assuming a fixed spectral index of -2/3 remains unaffected. Our results highlight the importance of accurate noise models for correctly inferring properties of the gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Cosmic neutrino background detection in the minimally extended Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of relic neutrino detection methods within the Standard Model, extended to include right-chiral neutrino singlets with Majorana mass terms. In particular, we study neutrino capture on unstable nuclei, the Stodolsky effect, coherent scattering, and an accelerator experiment. We demonstrate that the sensitivity transitions smoothly between Dirac and Majorana regimes, depending on the scale of lepton number violation. Importantly, neutral current interactions lead to transitions between the light and heavy neutrino states, necessitating the use of a density matrix formalism for accurate sensitivity calculations. As the oldest source of neutrinos in the universe, relic neutrinos would be able to provide an ultimate constraint on the lepton number violating scale, $m_R\gtrsim 10^{-33}~{\rm eV}$, below which neutrinos would behave as Dirac fermions for all practical purposes.</description>

      <title>Exploring gravitational impulse via quantum Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), wherein the initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Through this procedure, we obtain the system's impulse up to the second order for two massive objects. Similarly, we apply the forward scattering of the QBE to the gravitational impulse of a photon due to a massive object, during which we consider the photon as the system and the massive object as the environment. In this methodology, we use the QBE to compute the time evolution of the momentum operator associated with the system. While the forward scattering term vanishes when considering point particles, we demonstrate its persistence when using wave packets to describe both massive particles and the photon field. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Machine Learning Driven Tools for Detecting Millimeter Sources in Timestream Pre-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new pipeline utilizing machine learning for classifying short-duration features in raw time-ordered data (TOD) of cosmic microwave background survey observations. The pipeline, specifically designed for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, works in conjunction with the previous TOD preprocessing techniques that employ statistical thresholding to indiscriminately remove all large spikes in the data, whether they are due to noise features, cosmic rays, or true astrophysical sources, in a process called ``data cuts". This has the undesirable effect of excising real astrophysical sources, including transients, from the data. The classification pipeline demonstrated in this work uses the output from these data cuts and is able to differentiate between electronic noise, cosmic rays, and point sources, enabling the removal of undesired signals while retaining true astrophysical signals during TOD preprocessing. We achieve an overall accuracy of 90\% in categorizing data spikes of different origin and, importantly, 94\% for identifying those caused by astrophysical sources. Our pipeline also measures the amplitude of any detected source seen more than once and produces a subminute-to-minute light curve, providing information on its short timescale variability. This automated pipeline for source detection and amplitude estimation will be particularly useful for upcoming surveys with large data volumes, such as the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and future challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.</description>
