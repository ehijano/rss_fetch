      <title>Regularized Parameter Estimation in Mixed Model Trace Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce mixed model trace regression (MMTR), a mixed model linear regression extension for scalar responses and high-dimensional matrix-valued covariates. MMTR's fixed effects component is equivalent to trace regression, with an element-wise lasso penalty imposed on the regression coefficients matrix to facilitate the estimation of a sparse mean parameter. MMTR's key innovation lies in modeling the covariance structure of matrix-variate random effects as a Kronecker product of low-rank row and column covariance matrices, enabling sparse estimation of the covariance parameter through low-rank constraints. We establish identifiability conditions for the estimation of row and column covariance matrices and use them for rank selection by applying group lasso regularization on the columns of their respective Cholesky factors. We develop an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm extension for numerically stable parameter estimation in high-dimensional applications. MMTR achieves estimation accuracy comparable to leading regularized quasi-likelihood competitors across diverse simulation studies and attains the lowest mean square prediction error compared to its competitors on a publicly available image dataset.</description>

      <title>Learning local neighborhoods of non-Gaussian graphical models: A measure transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the Markov properties or conditional independencies of a collection of random variables is a fundamental task in statistics for modeling and inference. Existing approaches often learn the structure of a probabilistic graphical model, which encodes these dependencies, by assuming that the variables follow a distribution with a simple parametric form. Moreover, the computational cost of many algorithms scales poorly for high-dimensional distributions, as they need to estimate all the edges in the graph simultaneously. In this work, we propose a scalable algorithm to infer the conditional independence relationships of each variable by exploiting the local Markov property. The proposed method, named Localized Sparsity Identification for Non-Gaussian Distributions (L-SING), estimates the graph by using flexible classes of transport maps to represent the conditional distribution for each variable. We show that L-SING includes existing approaches, such as neighborhood selection with Lasso, as a special case. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings by comparing it to existing methods. Lastly, we show the scalability of the proposed approach by applying it to high-dimensional non-Gaussian examples, including a biological dataset with more than 150 variables.</description>

      <title>Comparative Judgement Modeling to Map Forced Marriage at Local Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01202v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forcing someone into marriage against their will is a violation of their human rights. In 2021, the county of Nottinghamshire, UK, launched a strategy to tackle forced marriage and violence against women and girls. However, accessing information about where victims are located in the county could compromise their safety, so it is not possible to develop interventions for different areas of the county. Comparative judgement studies offer a way to map the risk of human rights abuses without collecting data that could compromise victim safety. Current methods require studies to have a large number of participants, so we develop a comparative judgement model that provides a more flexible spatial modelling structure and a mechanism to schedule comparisons more effectively. The methods reduce the data collection burden on participants and make a comparative judgement study feasible with a small number of participants. Underpinning these methods is a latent variable representation that improves on the scalability of previous comparative judgement models. We use these methods to map the risk of forced marriage across Nottinghamshire thereby supporting the county's strategy for tackling violence against women and girls.</description>

      <title>Guided simulation of conditioned chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a chemical reaction process, modeled as a multi-dimensional continuous-time jump process. Assume that at given times $0&lt; t_1 &lt; \cdots &lt;t_n$, linear combinations $v_i = L_i X(t_i),\, i=1,\dots ,n$ are observed for given matrices $L_i$. We show how the process that is conditioned on hitting the states $v_1,\dots, v_n$ is obtained by a change of measure on the law of the unconditioned process. This results in an algorithm for obtaining weighted samples from the conditioned process. Our results are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>
