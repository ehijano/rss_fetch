      <title>Biswas-Chatterjee-Sen kinetic exchange opinion model for two connected groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a kinetic model of opinion dynamics known as the Biswas-Chatterjee-Sen model with a modular interaction structure. The system consists of two groups of agents that feature more frequent interactions within each group and rarer interactions between agents of different groups. We use the mean-field analytical approximation to determine that aside from previously known ordered and disordered states, a new antisymmetric ordered state is stable, where each group has an opposite dominant opinion. The limits of system interaction strength and noise for the stability of such a state are determined, with a discontinuous transition from an antisymmetric to a symmetric state happening if thresholds are exceeded. The results of numerical agent-based simulations confirm our analytical predictions and show that the critical values of noise and interaction strength are predicted with good accuracy.</description>

      <title>Competition between simple and complex contagion on temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavioral adoptions are influenced by peers in different ways. While some individuals may change after a single incoming influence, others need multiple cumulated attempts. These two mechanism, known as the simple and the complex contagions, often occur together in social phenomena alongside personal factors determining individual adoptions. Here we aim to identify, which of these contagion mechanism dominate a spreading process propagated by time-varying interactions. We consider three types of spreading scenarios: ones pre-dominated by simple or complex contagion, and mixed dynamics where the dominant mechanism changes during the unfolding of the spreading process. We propose different methods to analytically identify the transitions between these three scenarios and compare them with numerical simulations. This work offers new insights into social contagion dynamics on temporal networks, without assuming prior knowledge about individual's contagion mechanism driving their adoption decisions.</description>

      <title>The Impact of School and Family Networks on COVID-19 Infections Among Dutch Students: A Study Using Population-Level Registry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of different social interactions is key to improving epidemic models. Here, we use extensive registry data -- including PCR test results and population-level networks -- to investigate the impact of school, family, and other social contacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands (June 2020--October 2021). We isolate and compare different contexts of potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission by matching pairs of students based on their attendance at the same or different primary school (in 2020) and secondary school (in 2021) and their geographic proximity. We then calculated the probability of temporally associated infections -- i.e. the probability of both students testing positive within a 14-day period.
  Our results highlight the relative importance of household and family transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to school settings. The probability of temporally associated infections for siblings and parent-child pairs living in the same household was 22.6--23.2\%, and 4.7--7.9\% for family members living in different household. In contrast, the probability of temporally associated infections was 0.52\% for pairs of students living nearby but not attending the same primary or secondary school, 0.66\% for pairs attending different secondary schools but having attended the same primary school, and 1.65\% for pairs attending the same secondary school. Finally, we used multilevel regression analyses to examine how individual, school, and geographic factors contribute to transmission risk. We found that the largest differences in transmission probabilities were due to unobserved individual (60\%) and school-level (35\%) factors. Only a small proportion (3\%) could be attributed to geographic proximity of students or to school size, denomination, or the median income of the school area.</description>
