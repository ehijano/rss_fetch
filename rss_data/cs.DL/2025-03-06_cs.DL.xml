      <title>From Coverage to Prestige: A Comprehensive Assessment of Large-Scale Scientometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As research in the Scientometric deepens, the impact of data quality on research outcomes has garnered increasing attention. This study, based on Web of Science (WoS) and Crossref datasets, systematically evaluates the differences between data sources and the effects of data merging through matching, comparison, and integration. Two core metrics were employed: Reference Coverage Rate (RCR) and Article Scientific Prestige (ASP), which respectively measure citation completeness (quantity) and academic influence (quality). The results indicate that the WoS dataset outperforms Crossref in its coverage of high-impact literature and ASP scores, while the Crossref dataset provides complementary value through its broader coverage of literature. Data merging significantly improves the completeness of the citation network, with particularly pronounced benefits in smaller disciplinary clusters such as Education and Arts. However, data merging also introduces some low-quality citations, resulting in a polarization of overall data quality. Moreover, the impact of data merging varies across disciplines; high-impact clusters such as Science, Biology, and Medicine benefit the most, whereas clusters like Social Sciences and Arts are more vulnerable to negative effects. This study highlights the critical role of data sources in Scientometric research and provides a framework for assessing and improving data quality.</description>

      <title>Which books do I like?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding enjoyable fiction books can be challenging, partly because stories are multi-faceted and one's own literary taste might be difficult to ascertain. Here, we introduce the ISAAC method (Introspection-Support, AI-Annotation, and Curation), a pipeline which supports fiction readers in gaining awareness of their literary preferences and finding enjoyable books. ISAAC consists of four steps: a user supplies book ratings, an AI agent researches and annotates the provided books, patterns in book enjoyment are reviewed by the user, and the AI agent recommends new books. In this proof-of-concept self-study, the authors test whether ISAAC can highlight idiosyncratic patterns in their book enjoyment, spark a deeper reflection about their literary tastes, and make accurate, personalized recommendations of enjoyable books and underexplored literary niches. Results highlight substantial advantages of ISAAC over existing methods such as an integration of automation and intuition, accurate and customizable annotations, and explainable book recommendations. Observed disadvantages are that ISAAC's outputs can elicit false self-narratives (if statistical patterns are taken at face value), that books cannot be annotated if their online documentation is lacking, and that people who are new to reading have to rely on assumed book ratings or movie ratings to power the ISAAC pipeline. We discuss additional opportunities of ISAAC-style book annotations for the study of literary trends, and the scientific classification of books and readers.</description>

      <title>Measuring a moving target -- Innovation studies in practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper pays a tribute to Loet's work in a specific way. More than 20 years ago Loet Leydesdorff and myself designed a programme for future innovation studies 'Measuring the knowledge base - a programme of innovation studies'. Although, the funding programme we envisioned eventually did not materialise, the proposal text set out the main lines of our research collaboration over the coming decades. This paper revisits main statements of this programme and discusses their remaining validity in the light of more recent research. Core to the Leydesdorff and Scharnhorst text was a system-theoretical, evolutionary perspective on science dynamics, newly emerging structures and phenomena and addressed the question to which extent they could be meaningful studied using quantitative approaches. This paper looks into three cases - all examples of newly emerging institutional structures and related practices in science. They are all located at the interface between research and research infrastructures. While discussing how the programmatic ideas written up at the beginning of the 2000s still informs measurement attempts in those three cases, the paper also touches upon questions of epistemological foundations of quantitative studies in general. The main conclusion is that combining measurement experiments with philosophical reflection remains important.</description>

      <title>Hidden memory and stochastic fluctuations in science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the statistical laws governing citation dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in network theory and the science of science. Citation networks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by log-normal distributions, yet they also display power-law behaviour in the high-citation regime, presenting an apparent contradiction that lacks a unified explanation. Here, we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the variance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law with respect to time since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$. This discovery introduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to resolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent attention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process incorporating cumulative advantage. This process is characterised by the Hurst parameter $H$, derived from fractional Brownian motion, and volatility. Our framework reconciles this contradiction by demonstrating that anti-persistent fluctuations ($H&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$) give rise to log-normal citation distributions, whereas persistent dynamics ($H&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}$) favour heavy-tailed power laws. Numerical simulations confirm our model's explanatory and predictive power, interpolating between log-normal and power-law distributions while reproducing the $t^{H}$ law. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints further supports our theory, revealing an intrinsically anti-persistent nature with an upper bound of approximately $H=0.13$. By linking memory effects and stochastic fluctuations to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science and other attention-driven processes.</description>

      <title>Political Hegemony, Imitation Isomorphism, and Project Familiarity: Instrumental Variables to Understand Funding Impact on Scholar Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contributes a new idea for exploring research funding effects on scholar performance. By collecting details of 9,501 research grants received by principal investigators from universities in the U.S. social sciences from 2000 to 2019 and data on their publications and citations in the Microsoft Academic Graph and Web of Science bibliographic collections, we build a novel dataset of grants and article counts, citations, and journal CiteScore. Based on this dataset, we first introduce three instrumental variables (IVs) suitable for isolating endogeneity issues in the study of competing grant effects, namely scholars political hegemony in academia, imitation isomorphic behavior among scholars, and project familiarity. Then, this study explains the research funding effects by combining the three IVs with a two-stage least square (2SLS) model. Also, we provide validity and robustness tests of these three IVs and research funding effects. We find that our IVs serve the function of exogenizing and isolating endogeneity in capturing the research funding effect. Empirical findings show that receiving research funding increases a scholars research output and impact. While research funding doesn't significantly increase high CiteScore publications, it reduces submissions to low-prestige journals, reshaping journal selection strategies and raising the floor of academic performance.</description>
