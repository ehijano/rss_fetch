      <title>Inverting the wedge map and Gauss composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1 \le k \le n,$ and let $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ be integral vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We consider the wedge map $\alpha_{n,k} : (\mathbb{Z}^n)^k /SL_k(\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \wedge^k(\mathbb{Z}^n)$, $(v_1,\ldots,v_k) \rightarrow v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_k $. In his Disquisitiones, Gauss proved that $\alpha_{n,2}$ is injective when restricted to a primitive system of vectors when defining his composition law for binary quadratic forms. He also gave an algorithm for inverting $\alpha_{3,2}$ in a different context on the representation of integers by ternary quadratic forms. We give here an explicit algorithm for inverting $\alpha_{n,2}$, and observe via Bhargava's composition law for $\mathbb{Z}^2 \otimes \mathbb{Z}^2 \otimes \mathbb{Z}^2 $ cube that inverting $\alpha_{4,2}$ is the main algorithmic step in Gauss's composition law for binary quadratic forms. This places Gauss's composition as a special case of the geometric problem of inverting a wedge map which may be of independent interests. We also show that a given symmetric positive definite matrix $A$ induces a natural metric on the integral Grassmannian $G_{n,k}(\mathbb{Z})$ so that the map $X \rightarrow X^TAX$ becomes norm preserving.</description>

      <title>Sums of squares and sequences of modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $h_n(v)$ be the sequence of rational functions with $$ \frac{h_n(v)}{v}-nh_n(v)+(n-1)h_{n-1}(v)-vh_{n-1}'(v)+\frac{v(v(vh_{n-1}(v))')'}{4}=0 $$ for $n&gt;0$ and $h_0(v)=1$. We prove that $h_n(v)$ has a pole at $v=\frac{1}{n}$ if and only if $n$ is a sum of two squares of integers. Moreover, if $r_2(n)=\#\{(a,b)\in \mathbb Z^2: a^2+b^2=n\}$, then we derive the formula $$ \underset{v=1/n}{\mathrm{Res}}h_n(v)=\frac{(-1)^{n-1}r_2(n)}{n16^n}. $$ The results are then generalized to arbitrary modular forms with respect to $\Gamma(2)$ and as a consequence we obtain a new criterion for Lehmer's conjecture for Ramanujan's $\tau$-function.</description>

      <title>Counting Rational Points In Non-Isotropic Neighborhoods of Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we initiate the study of the number of rational points with bounded denominators, contained in a non-isotropic $\delta_1\times\ldots\times \delta_R$ neighborhood of a compact submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ of codimension $R$ in $\mathbb{R}^{M}$. We establish an upper bound for this counting function which holds when $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies a strong curvature condition, first introduced by Schindler-Yamagishi in \cite{schindler2022density}. Further, even in the isotropic case when $\delta_1=\ldots=\delta_R=\delta$, we obtain an asymptotic formula which holds beyond the range of distance to $\mathcal{M}$ established in \cite{schindler2022density}. Our result is also a generalization of the work of J.J. Huang \cite{huangduke} for hypersurfaces.
  As an application, we establish for the first time an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of weighted simultaneously well approximable points on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ satisfying the strong curvature condition, which agrees with the lower bound obtained by Allen-Wang in \cite{allen2022note}. Moreover, for $R&gt;1$, we obtain a new upper bound for the number of rational points \textit{on} $\mathcal{M}$, which goes beyond the bound in an analogue of Serre's dimension growth conjecture for submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^M$ .</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\Gamma$ a cofinite Fuchsian group, and $l$ a fixed closed geodesic, we study the asymptotics of the number of those images of $l$ that have a prescribed orientation and distance from $l$ less than or equal to $X$. We give a new concrete proof of the error bound $O(X^{2/3})$ that appears in the works of Good and Hejhal. Furthermore, we prove a new bound $O(X^{1/2}\log{X})$ for the mean square of the error. For particular arithmetic groups, we provide interpretations in terms of correlation sums of the number of ideals of norm at most $X$ in associated number fields, generalizing previous examples due to Hejhal.</description>

Abstract: Let $E/F$ be a non Archimedean local field and $\psi:\frac{E}{F}\to \mathbb{C}$ a non trivial character. Using harmonic analysis on Harish-Chandra Schwartz spaces, we prove that if $n$ is an integer at least equal to two and $\pi$ is a square integrable representation of $GL_n(E)$ such that $\gamma(\pi,\pi',\psi)=1$ for any $GL_{n-1}(F)$-distinguished tempered representation $\pi'$ of $GL_{n-1}(E)$, then $\pi$ is $GL_n(F)$-distinguished.</description>

      <title>Generalized Campana points and adelic approximation on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for studying special subsets of rational points on an algebraic variety, termed $\mathcal{M}$-points. The notion of $\mathcal{M}$-points generalizes the concepts of integral points, Campana points and Darmon points. We introduce and study $M$-approximation over number fields and function fields, which is a notion that generalizes weak and strong approximation. We show that this property implies that the set of $\mathcal{M}$-points is not thin. We then give a simple characterisation of when a split toric varieties satisfy $M$-approximation, generalizing work of Nakahara and Streeter. Further, we determine when the set of $\mathcal{M}$-points on a split toric variety is thin.</description>

      <title>Existence of arithmetic degrees for generic orbits and dynamical Lang-Siegel problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of the arithmetic degree for dominant rational self-maps at any point whose orbit is generic. As a corollary, we prove the same existence for \'etale morphisms on quasi-projective varieties and any points on it. We apply the proof of this fact to dynamical Lang-Siegel problem. Namely, we prove that local height function associated with zero-dimensional subscheme grows slowly along orbits of a rational map under reasonable assumption. Also if local height function associated with any proper closed subscheme grows fast on a subset of an orbit of a self-morphism, we prove that such subset has Banach density zero under some assumptions.</description>

Abstract: This is the second in a series of two papers presenting a solution to Hilbert's 12th problem for real quadratic function fields in positive characteristic, in the sense of proving an analog of the Theorem of Weber-Fueter. We also offer a conjectural treatment of the number field case using quasicrystal counterparts of the constructions used in function fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reinterpret a result of Pop and Stix on the $p$-adic section conjecture in terms of Berkovich spaces and fixed points. In doing this, we see a version of the result extends to larger classes of fields, which in turn allows us to prove a valuative section conjecture type result for a larger class of varieties. This adds to the programme to reinterpret anabelian geometry results in terms of \'etale homotopy types.</description>

      <title>Galois module structure of algebraic integers of the simplest cubic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L_n$ be a simplest cubic field with Galois group $G=\rm{Gal} (L_n/\mathbb Q)$. The associated order is denoted as ${\cal A}_{L_n/\mathbb Q}:= \{ x\in {\mathbb Q} [G] \, |\, x \cdot \cal{O}_{L_n} \subset {\cal O}_{L_n } \}$, where ${\cal O}_{L_n}$ is the ring of integers of $L_n$. Leopoldt showed that $\cal{O}_{L_n} \simeq {\cal A}_{L_n/\mathbb Q}$ as ${\cal A}_{L_n/\mathbb Q}$-modules. In this paper, we give a generator of the ${\cal A}_{L_n/\mathbb Q}$-module ${\cal O}_{L_n}$ explicitly using the roots of Shanks' cubic polynomial. If $L_n/\mathbb Q$ is tamely ramified, then we have ${\cal A}_{L_n/\mathbb Q}=\mathbb Z [G]$, and the conjugates form a normal integral basis, which has been obtained explicitly in the previous work of Hashimoto and the second author.</description>

Abstract: We study the distribution of consecutive sums of two squares in arithmetic progressions. If $\{E_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the sequence of sums of two squares in increasing order, we show that for any modulus $q$ and any congruence classes $a_1,a_2,a_3 \mod q$ which are admissible in the sense that there are solutions to $x^2 + y^2 \equiv a_i \mod q$, there exist infinitely many $n$ with $E_{n+i-1} \equiv a_i \mod q$, for $i = 1,2,3$. We also show that for any $r_1, r_2 \ge 1$, there exist infinitely many $n$ with $E_{n+i-1} \equiv a_1 \mod q$ for $1 \le i \le r_1$ and $E_{n+ i - 1} \equiv a_2 \mod q$ for $r_1 + 1 \le i \le r_1 + r_2$.</description>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a holomorphic cuspidal Hecke eigenform for $\mathrm{Sp}_4(\mathbb{Z})$ of weight $k$ that is a Saito--Kurokawa lift. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), we prove that the mass of $F$ equidistributes on the Siegel modular variety as $k\longrightarrow \infty$. As a corollary, we show under GRH that the zero divisors of Saito--Kurokawa lifts equidistribute as their weights tend to infinity.</description>

Abstract: By $p$-adically interpolating the branching law for the spherical pair $\left(U_n, U_{n+1} \times U_{n}\right)$ of definite unitary groups, we construct a $p$-adic $L$-function attached to cohomological automorphic representations of $U_{n+1} \times U_{n}$. Under a further multiplicity one assumption, we extend the construction to Coleman families. Our $p$-adic $L$-function interpolates the square root of the central critical $L$-value. It has weight and anticyclotomic variables and its construction relies on the proof of the unitary Gan--Gross--Prasad conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain $\Omega$-results for linear exponential sums with rational additive twists of small prime denominators weighted by Hecke eigenvalues of Maass cusp forms for the group $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb Z)$. In particular, our $\Omega$-results match the expected conjectural upper bounds when the denominator of the twist is sufficiently small compared to the length of the sum. Non-trivial $\Omega$-results for sums over short segments are also obtained. Along the way we produce lower bounds for mean squares of the exponential sums in question and also improve the best known upper bound for these sums in some ranges of parameters.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Primitive Lattice Points in Large Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the distribution of primitive lattice points in a symmetric Borel set $S_d\subset\mathbb R^d$ as $d$ goes to infinity, under certain volume conditions on $S_d$. Our main technique involves exploring higher moment formulas for the primitive Siegel transform. We first demonstrate that if the volume of $S_d$ remains fixed for all $d\in \mathbb N$, then the distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Poisson distribution of mean $\frac 1 2$. Furthermore, if the volume of $S_d$ goes to infinity subexponentially as $d$ approaches infinity, the normalized distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the normal distribution $\mathcal N(0,1)$. We also extend these results to the setting of stochastic processes. This work is motivated by the contributions of Rogers (1955), S\"odergren (2011) and Str\"ombergsson and S\"odergren (2019).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$ endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. In this paper, we show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, as $g\to \infty$, for a generic surface in $\mathcal{M}_g$, the error term in the Prime Geodesic Theorem is bounded from above by $g\cdot t^{\frac{3}{4}+\epsilon}$, up to a uniform constant multiplication. The expected value of the error term in the Prime Geodesic Theorem over $\mathcal{M}_g$ is also studied. As an application, we show that as $g\to \infty$, on a generic hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_g$ most closed geodesics of length significantly less than $\sqrt{g}$ are simple and non-separating, and most closed geodesics of length significantly greater than $\sqrt{g}$ are not simple, which confirms a conjecture of Lipnowski-Wright.
  A novel effective upper bound for intersection numbers on $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ is also established, when certain indices are large compared to $\sqrt{g+n}$.</description>

      <title>On $q$-deformed Farey sum and a homological interpretation of $q$-deformed real quadratic irrational numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06056v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The left and right $q$-deformed rational numbers were introduced by Bapat, Becker and Licata via regular continued fractions, and they gave a homological interpretation for left and right $q$-deformed rational numbers. In the present paper, we focus on negative continued fractions and defined left $q$-deformed negative continued fractions. We give a formula for computing the $q$-deformed Farey sum of the left $q$-deformed rational numbers based on it. We use this formula to give a combinatorial proof of the relationship between the left $q$-deformed rational number and the Jones polynomial of the corresponding rational knot which was proved by Bapat, Becker and Licata using a homological technique. Finally, we combine their work and the $q$-deformed Farey sum, and give a homological interpretation of the $q$-deformed Farey sum. We also give an approach to finding a relationship between real quadratic irrational numbers and homological algebra.</description>
