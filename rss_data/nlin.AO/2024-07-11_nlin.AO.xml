      <title>Network inference from oscillatory signals based on circle map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand and control the dynamics of coupled oscillators, it is important to reveal the structure of the interaction network from observed data. While various techniques have been developed for inferring the network of asynchronous systems, it remains challenging to infer the network of synchronized oscillators without external stimulations. In this study, we develop a method for non-invasively inferring the network of synchronized and/or de-synchronized oscillators. An approach to network inference would be to fit the data to a set of differential equations describing the dynamics of phase oscillators. However, we show that this method fails to infer the true network due to the problems that arise when we use short-time phase differences. Therefore, we propose a method based on the circle map, which describes the phase change in one oscillatory cycle. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through the successful inference of the network structure from simulated data of limit cycle oscillator models. Our method provides a unified and concise framework for network estimation for a wide class of oscillator systems.</description>

      <title>Causal Leverage Density: A General Approach to Semantic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I introduce a new approach to semantic information based upon the influence of erasure operations (interventions) upon distributions of a system's future trajectories through its phase space. Semantic (meaningful) information is distinguished from syntactic information by the property of having some intrinsic causal power on the future of a given system. As Shannon famously stated, syntactic information is a simple property of probability distributions (the elementary Shannon expression), or correlations between two subsystems and thus does not tell us anything about the meaning of a given message. Kolchinsky &amp; Wolpert (2018) introduced a powerful framework for computing semantic information, which employs interventions upon the state of a system (either initial or dynamic) to erase syntactic information that might influence the viability of a subsystem (such as an organism in an environment). In this work I adapt this framework such that rather than using the viability of a subsystem, we simply observe the changes in future trajectories through a system's phase space as a result of informational interventions (erasures or scrambling). This allows for a more general formalisation of semantic information that does not assume a primary role for the viability of a subsystem (to use examples from Kolchinsky &amp; Wolpert (2018), a rock, a hurricane, or a cell). Many systems of interest have a semantic component, such as a neural network, but may not have such an intrinsic connection to viability as living organisms or dissipative structures. Hence this simple approach to semantic information could be applied to any living, non-living or technological system in order to quantify whether a given quantity of syntactic information within it also has semantic or causal power.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on discrete topologies: from networks to higher-order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nature is a blossoming of regular structures, signature of self-organization of the underlying microscopic interacting agents. Turing theory of pattern formation is one of the most studied mechanisms to address such phenomena and has been applied to a widespread gallery of disciplines. Turing himself used a spatial discretization of the hosting support to eventually deal with a set of ODEs. Such an idea contained the seeds of the theory on discrete support, which has been fully acknowledged with the birth of network science in the early 2000s. This approach allows us to tackle several settings not displaying a trivial continuous embedding, such as multiplex, temporal networks, and, recently, higher-order structures. This line of research has been mostly confined within the network science community, despite its inherent potential to transcend the conventional boundaries of the PDE-based approach to Turing patterns. Moreover, network topology allows for novel dynamics to be generated via a universal formalism that can be readily extended to account for higher-order structures. The interplay between continuous and discrete settings can pave the way for further developments in the field.</description>

      <title>Competing aggregation and iso-density equilibrium lead to band pattern formation in density gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centrifugation of erythrocytes (aka Red Blood Cells, RBCs) in a self-forming Percoll gradient is a protocol often used as a way to sort RBCs by age. However, a pattern formation of discrete bands is systematically observed along the continuous density gradient. Although early studies mentioned that aggregation between cells might modify their spatial distribution, it is debated whether a population with continuous density distribution can form discrete bands. Here, we develop a continuity equation, considering the aggregation of cells with a continuous density distribution, which describes the macroscopic evolution of the RBC volume concentration in a density gradient. The numerical solutions demonstrate that the competition between iso-density distribution and aggregation is sufficient to create band patterns. Our model reproduces the temporal evolution observed in the conventional experimental protocol, but also predicts several types of bifurcation-like behaviors for the steady-state patterns in constant gradients, when the volume fraction and aggregation energy of the cells are varied. We threrefore discovered that the competition between RBC aggregation and iso-density distribution is a novel physical mechanism leading to pattern formation.</description>
