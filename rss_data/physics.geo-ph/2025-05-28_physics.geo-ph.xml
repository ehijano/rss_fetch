      <title>Video-based Direct Time Series Measurement of Along-Strike Slip on the Coseismic Surface Rupture During the 2025 Mw7.7 Myanmar Earthquake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a time-resolved analysis of coseismic lateral surface rupture along the Sagaing Fault during the Mw 7.7 Mandalay, Myanmar earthquake on March 28, 2025. Leveraging a publicly available Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage alongside on-site measurements, we show the first in-situ high sampling rate direct measurement of a coseismic slip evolution of a fault during an earthquake. Our work comprises four primary stages: data acquisition, video pre-processing, object tracking, and physical displacement estimation. Video pre-processing includes camera stabilization and distortion correction. We then track pixel-level movements of selected reference points using two complementary computer-vision approaches -- a traditional grayscale template matching algorithm and a state-of-the-art vision transformer multi-object tracking algorithm, and verify both profiles against meticulous manual frame-by-frame measurements, with results that closely match one another. Finally, we translated those pixel displacements into real-world ground movements by calibrating against reference objects whose dimensions were measured on site. Based on the resulting displacement time series, we estimated the critical slip-weakening distance. The resulting high-resolution time series of the along-strike slip, provided in the appendix, offers a critical benchmark for validating dynamic rupture simulations, refining frictional models, and enhancing seismic hazard assessment.</description>

      <title>SeisCoDE: 3D Seismic Interpretation Foundation Model with Contrastive Self-Distillation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic interpretation is vital for understanding subsurface structures but remains labor-intensive, subjective, and computationally demanding. While deep learning (DL) offers promise, its success hinges on large, high-quality datasets, often scarce in geophysics. Foundation Models (FMs), which have shown significant success in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, offer a transformative opportunity for seismic interpretation by enabling knowledge transfer and generalization across interpretation tasks. However, the application of FMs in this domain remains limited, especially at the 3D scale, due to the absence of a domain-specific pretraining workflow. Here, our study sought to develop a pretraining strategy for 3D seismic interpretation by introducing a vision transformer-based Seismic Contrastive Self-Distillation Encoder (SeisCoDE), a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that leverages seismic signal processing and attribute analysis, preserving seismic structural integrity during pretraining. By leveraging contrastive learning and self-distillation, SeisCoDE learns meaningful latent representations without the need for labeled data (zero-shot approach). Results indicate that SeisCoDE effectively captures critical seismic features and characteristics, producing robust latent feature representations that drive downstream seismic interpretation. It demonstrates enhanced generalization abilities across different seismic interpretation tasks, outperforming the conventional supervised learning UNet method. Overall, this research emphasizes the potential of FMs informed by seismic image processing and attribute analysis principles, paving the way for continued innovation integrating FMs for seismic interpretation, with the potential to revolutionize subsurface characterization and geophysical seismic exploration.</description>

      <title>Generalised Time-Series Analysis of Fault Mechanics Using Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how faults nucleate and grow is a critical problem in earthquake science and hazard assessment. This study examines fault development in Alzo granite under triaxial pressures ranging from 5 to 40 MPa by applying a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) to multi-parameter acoustic emission (AE) data. The TDNN integrates waveform-derived attributes, including peak delay and scattering attenuation, with occurrence-based metrics such as time distributions, Gutenberg-Richter b-values, and spatial fractal dimensions, to characterize the transition from distributed microcracking to localised faulting. Optimised via genetic algorithms, the TDNN dynamically weights these parameters, enabling accurate characterisation of fault growth stages. Our results delineate three distinct phases of fault evolution: nucleation of random microcracks indicated by changes in elastic wave scattering, initiation of fault growth reflected in evolving AE spatial and magnitude distributions, and fault coalescence marked by exponential increases in peak delay and b-value shifts. The model predicts the timing and magnitude of stress drops across varying pressures and failure mechanisms, from axial splitting to shear localisation, providing deeper insights into fault mechanics through explainable AI models.</description>

      <title>The mantle-inner core gravitational mode of oscillation in a strong magnetic field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mantle-inner core gravitational (MICG) mode is the free mode axial oscillation between the mantle and inner core sustained by the gravitational torque between their degree 2 order 2 density structures. Here, we investigate how the MICG mode is affected by oscillations of cylindrical surfaces in the fluid outer core in the form of Alfv\'en waves. The latter are triggered by oscillations of the tangent cylinder (TC) moving jointly with the inner core and propagate away from the rotation axis. We show that the MICG mode remains a distinct normal mode of oscillation of the core-mantle system only when the triggered Alfv\'en waves are attenuated before they traverse the width of the fluid core. For an internal magnetic field strength of a few mT, as we expect in Earth's core, Alfv\'en waves can readily traverse the width of the core, and the MICG mode is absorbed into the spectrum of torsional oscillation (TO) modes. The MICG period retains a dynamical influence, acting as a point of resonance for TO modes, and marking the transition from a TO mode in which the motion of the TC (including the inner core) is weakly impacted by gravitational coupling to one in which the oscillating motion of the TC is strongly restricted. Our results imply that the observed 6-year periodic signal in the length of day cannot be interpreted as the signature of the MICG mode and must instead be caused by TO modes, or more generally, by the propagation of Alfv\'en waves.</description>

      <title>The role of interior dynamics and differentiation on the surface and atmosphere of lava planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lava planets are rocky exoplanets that orbit so close to their host star that their day-side is hot enough to melt silicate rock. Their short orbital periods ensure that lava planets are tidally locked into synchronous rotation, with permanent day and night hemispheres. Such asymmetric magma oceans have no analogs in the Solar System and will exhibit novel fluid dynamics.
  Here we report numerical simulations of lava planet interiors showing that solid-liquid fractionation in the planetary interior has a major impact on the compositional structure and evolution of the planet. We explored two styles of dynamics that depend primarily on the interior thermal state : 1) a hot fully molten interior, and 2) a mostly solid interior with a shallow day-side magma ocean.
  In the hot interior scenario, the atmosphere reflects the planet's bulk silicate composition and the night-side crust is gravitationally unstable and constantly replenished. In the cool interior scenario, the distilled atmosphere will lack Na, K and FeO, and the night-side mantle is entirely solid, with a cold surface. These two end-member cases can be distinguished with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, offering an avenue to probe the diversity of terrestrial exoplanet evolutions.</description>

      <title>Two regimes of dilute turbulent settling suspensions under shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When turbulent flow is laden with negatively buoyant particles, their mean distribution over the direction of gravity can induce stable density gradients that penalize turbulent fluctuations. This effect is studied numerically for shear-driven flow with dilute non-inertial sediment. The turbulent dynamics and sediment transport depend critically on particle settling velocity $v_s$, splitting into two regimes: homogeneous weakly stratified turbulence and flow with developed turbulence atop an intermittent boundary layer. At intermediate $v_s$, neither state can be sustained and the flow laminarizes.</description>

      <title>The influence of data gaps and outliers on resilience indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resilience, or stability, of major Earth system components is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic pressures, demanding reliable early warning signals for abrupt and irreversible regime shifts. Widely used data-driven resilience indicators based on variance and autocorrelation detect `critical slowing down', a signature of decreasing stability. However, the interpretation of these indicators is hampered by poorly understood interdependencies and their susceptibility to common data issues such as missing values and outliers. Here, we establish a rigorous mathematical analysis of the statistical dependency between variance- and autocorrelation-based resilience indicators, revealing that their agreement is fundamentally driven by the time series' initial data point. Using synthetic and empirical data, we demonstrate that missing values substantially weaken indicator agreement, while outliers introduce systematic biases that lead to overestimation of resilience based on temporal autocorrelation. Our results provide a necessary and rigorous foundation for preprocessing strategies and accuracy assessments across the growing number of disciplines that use real-world data to infer changes in system resilience.</description>
