      <title>The DESI Y1 RR Lyrae catalog II: The metallicity dependency of pulsational properties, the shape of the RR Lyrae instability strip, and metal rich RR Lyrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are valuable probes of both Milky Way assembly and stellar-evolution physics. Using a sample 6,240 RRLs obtained in the first year of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we investigate the metallicity of RRLs and its correlation with their pulsation properties. We find that (1) a clear correlation between period and [Fe/H] reinforces the view that the longstanding Oosterhoff dichotomy arises from the scarcity of intermediate-metallicity Galactic globular clusters hosting sizeable RRL samples; (2) high-amplitude short-period and small-amplitude short-period variables are comparatively metal-rich, with mean [Fe/H] = $-1.39 \pm 0.27$ and $-1.30 \pm 0.28$, respectively; (3) in double-mode pulsators (RRd) the metallicity declines smoothly with increasing fundamental-mode period, and anomalous RRd stars occupy a remarkably narrow [Fe/H] range relative to classical RRd stars; (4) this spectroscopic sample let us, for the first time, place empirical constraints on the metallicity-dependent topology of the instability strip using phase-corrected effective temperatures and a large number of RRLs, where we observe an instability strip that moves towards cooler Teff with declining [Fe/H] with a width consistent with stellar-evolution models; and (5) a subset of metal-rich RRLs exhibits orbits consistent with disk membership and halo kinematics. Our results confirm the tantalizing potential of DESI for Galactic and stellar astrophysics and highlight the importance of the even larger samples of RRLs and data-processing improvements forthcoming in future DESI data releases.</description>

      <title>commensurability: a Python package for classifying astronomical orbits based on their toroid volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a star orbits the center of its host galaxy, the trajectory is encompassed within a 3D toroid. The orbit probes all points in this toroid, unless its orbital frequencies exhibit integer ratios (commensurate frequencies), in which case a small sub-volume is traversed. commensurability is a Python package that implements a tessellation-based algorithm for identifying orbital families that satisfy commensurabilities by measuring the toroid volume traversed over orbit integration. Compared to standard orbit classification methods such as frequency analysis, tessellation analysis relies on configuration space properties alone, making classification results more robust to frequency instabilities or limited integration times. The package provides a framework for analyzing phase-space coordinates using tessellation analysis, including a subpackage for the implementation of the general tessellation algorithm. The package is to be used with a galactic dynamics library; it currently supports AGAMA, gala, and galpy.</description>

      <title>Redshift evolution of Lyman continuum escape fraction after JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LyC escape fraction from galaxies, $f_{\rm esc}$, is strongly boosted by galactic outflows. In the Attenuation-Free Model (AFM) accounting for the properties of $z&gt;10$ galaxies, radiation-driven outflows develop once the galaxy specific star formation rate, ${\rm sSFR} \ge {\rm sSFR}^* \approx 25\ {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$. As the cosmic sSFR increases with redshift, so does $f_{\rm esc}(z)$, which, when globally averaged, grows from 0.007 to 0.6 in $0 &lt; z &lt; 20$. We successfully tested the model on specific data sub-samples. Our predictions are consistent with direct measurements of $f_{\rm esc}$ up to $z=6.5$, and provide a physical explanation for the observed decreasing trend of the mean UV galaxy spectral slope, $\beta$, towards high-$z$.</description>

      <title>Measuring Emission Lines with JWST-MegaScience Medium-Bands: A New Window into Dust and Star Formation at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the power of JWST-NIRCam medium-band photometry to measure emission line fluxes and study dust and star formation properties of galaxies at cosmic noon. In this work, we present photometric emission line measurements and spatially-resolved maps of H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ for a sample of 14 galaxies at $1.3\leq z\leq 2.4$, observed by the MegaScience medium-band survey and the UNCOVER deep spectroscopic survey. We measure line fluxes directly from the medium-band photometry and compare with spectroscopic measurements from UNCOVER. We find reasonable agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic emission line fluxes for both H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, with scatter $&lt;0.15$ dex down to emission line equivalent widths of $10$\r{A}. We also make a nebular dust measurement from the ratio Pa$\beta$ / H$\alpha$, finding an average nebular A$_\mathrm{V}$ of 1.4. Our photometric A$_\mathrm{V}$ measurements show a slightly larger scatter of $0.5$ magnitudes when compared to spectroscopic measurements; however, this scatter may be partially caused by aperture effects. Finally, we produce spatially resolved maps of H$\alpha$ emission, Pa$\beta$ emission, and stellar continuum. We find that offsets in H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ emission are common, especially for galaxies with the highest A$_\mathrm{V}$, indicating dusty sub-structures. Furthermore, the correlation between H$\alpha$ and continuum emission decreases with increasing A$_\mathrm{V}$, suggesting that the dustiest objects have clumpy dust and star formation distributions. Our study demonstrates the power of medium-band photometry to directly probe emission line strengths, star formation, and dust attenuation for hundreds of galaxies in UNCOVER and thousands of galaxies in upcoming JWST medium-band surveys.</description>

      <title>Truncated star formation and ram pressure stripping in the Coma Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use 45 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey to study the physical drivers of star formation quenching in the Coma cluster. We measure specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles for the Coma sample as well as a control sample of non-cluster field galaxies. We find that compared to the control sample, galaxies within the Coma Cluster have sSFR profiles that fall off more steeply with galactocentric radius. We then apply a toy model based on slow-then-rapid quenching via ram pressure stripping. We find that this model is able to reproduce the difference in sSFR profiles between field and Coma galaxies. These results demonstrate that ram pressure stripping plays a significant role in quenching star formation in the nearest massive galaxy cluster.</description>

      <title>Origins of Carbon Dust in a JWST-Observed Primeval Galaxy at $z\sim$6.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JADES-GS-z6-0, a high-redshift galaxy ($z \sim 6.7$) recently observed as part of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), exhibits a distinct bump in its rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectrum indicative of a large quantity of hydrocarbon grains, a sign of rapid metal and dust enrichment in its interstellar medium (ISM). This galaxy serves as an ideal case for examining rapid dust formation processes in the early universe.
  We investigated diverse dust production channels from a possible maximal formation redshift of $z_{\rm form} \approx 17$, enabling dust contributions from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars over the longest possible timescale. Our model simultaneously reproduces key spectral features of JADES-GS-z6-0 such as its Balmer decrement, UV slope, and UV bump. The match is obtained by adopting a star-formation history in which a burst at $\sim 600$~Myr accounts for approximately 30\% of the galaxy's final stellar mass.
  Our findings indicate two pathways for the formation of hydrocarbon grains, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): (1) efficient dust accretion within the ISM, necessitating a low depletion of metals into dust grains from Type II supernovae ($\approx 10$\%), or (2) dust production predominantly by Type II supernovae, requiring a high depletion fraction ($\approx 73$\%) without dust accretion. We further demonstrate that PAHs are unlikely to originate solely from AGB stars or from shattering of large grains in the ISM. The evolution of the UV slope with redshift points to a complex and bursty star formation history for galaxies observed by JADES.</description>

      <title>Disrupted and surviving satellites of Milky-Way-mass galaxies: connecting their properties with their host accretion histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two populations of dwarf galaxies can be associated with the Milky Way (MW): the disrupted dwarfs that fully merged with it in the past and the surviving satellites that orbit around it in the present time. In this work, we analyzed the chemical composition of the cold gas in both populations of dwarfs associated with MW like galaxies in the ARTEMIS simulations. We found that, at fixed stellar mass, disrupted dwarfs have lower gas phase metallicity and are more alpha-enhanced than surviving dwarfs. We also noticed that disrupted satellites accreted earlier and with higher SF gas fractions had lower metallicity and higher [Mg/Fe] at fixed mass. In the case of surviving dwarfs, we obtained a similar trend for both gas-phase metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance.</description>

      <title>Frequency and Abundance of Binary sUpermassive bLack holes from Optical Variability Surveys (FABULOVS): Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of Radial-Velocity Selected Binary Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-parsec (sub-pc) binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs) should be common from galaxy mergers, yet direct evidence has been elusive. We present HST/WFC3IR F160W imaging for a sample of 8 candidate sub-pc BSBHs at redshifts z~0.1--0.5, as well as cross-comparison with a sample of ordinary quasars with archival HST/WFC3 IR F160W images. These 8 candidate sub-pc BSBHs were identified from multi-epoch spectroscopic surveys of quasars (including both typical quasars and those with single-peaked velocity-offset broad lines). whose broad H$\beta$ lines are significantly offset (by ~&lt; a few hundred km/s) from the systemic redshifts. We directly test the prediction that the host galaxies of BSBHs would have a higher fraction of disturbed morphologies and younger stellar bulges from recent interactions than those of control quasars. After careful subtraction of the central quasar light, our candidate BSBH hosts show a statistically undifferentiated distribution of host asymmetry, indicative of a similar fraction of recent mergers. While a significantly larger sample is needed to place this result on a much firmer statistical ground, it opens questions as to the timescale differences between galaxy merger and BSBH formation, or the efficacy of the radial-velocity-shift--based selection of sub-pc BSBH candidates.</description>

      <title>The link between galaxy structure properties and star formation in local galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the role of morphology in galaxy evolution, we analyze the relationships between galaxy structure, star formation, and HI gas content. Using multi-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, we perform detailed structural decompositions on a representative local galaxy sample from xGASS. Structural components and color properties are examined as functions of deviations from the star formation main sequence ($\rm \Delta SFR_{MS}$) and HI gas deficiency ($\rm \Delta f_{HI}$). We find that bulge fractions decrease with higher $\rm \Delta SFR_{MS}$ and lower stellar mass, indicating that star-forming galaxies are predominantly disc-dominated, while quiescent galaxies are bulge-dominated. The slope of the color ($g-r$) versus $\rm \Delta SFR_{MS}$ relationship decreases from low to high stellar masses and from outer to inner regions, with greater color variation in massive galaxies. Color gradients are predominantly negative, becoming shallower in lower-mass galaxies and in the outer disk regions. We also identify inflection points in the color gradient and bulge fraction relations with $\rm \Delta SFR_{MS}$, with main-sequence galaxies having the lowest bulge fractions and steepest color gradients. At fixed stellar mass, we observe only a slight correlation between bulge fraction and HI deficiency. However, outer disk colors show a stronger dependence on HI content than inner regions, and color gradients flatten as $\rm \Delta f_{HI}$ increases. These results suggest that HI gas is more closely linked to star-forming, disc-dominated systems, supporting the idea that gas accretion fuels star formation primarily in galaxy disks.</description>

      <title>The impact of spiral arms on the star formation life cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matter cycle between gas clouds and stars in galaxies plays a crucial role in regulating galaxy evolution through feedback mechanisms. In turn, the local and global galactic environments shape the interstellar medium and provide the initial conditions for star formation, potentially affecting the properties of this small-scale matter cycle. In particular, spiral arms have been proposed to play a pivotal role in the star formation life cycle, by enhancing the gas density and triggering star formation. However, their exact role is still debated. In this paper, we investigate the role of spiral arms in the giant molecular cloud evolutionary life cycle and on the star formation process in a sample of 22 nearby spiral galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We measure the cloud lifetime, the feedback timescale, the typical distance between independent regions and the star formation efficiency in spiral arms and inter-arm regions separately. We find that the distributions of the cloud lifetime as well as the feedback timescale are similar in both environments. This result suggests that spiral arms are unlikely to play a dominant role in triggering star formation. By contrast, the star formation efficiency appears to be slightly higher in inter-arm regions compared to spiral arms.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric insights into a potential binary supermassive black hole system in Mrk 231</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markarian 231 (Mrk 231) is one of the brightest ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) known to date. It displays a unique optical-UV spectrum, characterized by a strong and perplexing attenuation in the near-UV, associated with a sudden polarization peak. Building on previous spectro-photometric modeling, we investigated the hypothesis that the core of Mrk 231 may host a binary SMBH system. In this scenario, the accretion disk of the primary, more massive SMBH is responsible for the optical-UV spectrum. The disk of the secondary, less massive SMBH, would be expected to essentially emit in the far UV. We applied this model to archival photometric and polarimetric data of Mrk 231 and tried to obtain the best fit possible. To support our findings, we performed radiative transfer calculations to determine the spatial disposition of each main component constituting Mrk 231. We find that a binary SMBH model can reproduce both the observed flux and polarization of Mrk 231 remarkably well. We infer that the core potentially hosts a binary SMBH system, with a primary SMBH of about 1.6x10^8 solar masses and a secondary of about 1.1x10^7 solar masses , separated by a semimajor axis of 146 AU.The secondary SMBH drives a degree of polarization of 3 % between 0.1 and 0.2 {\mu}m, with a corresponding polarization position angle of about 134{\deg} , which is consistent with scattering within an accretion disk. The primary SMBH and the structure around it are responsible for a degree of polarization of 23 % between 0.3 and 0.4 {\mu}m with a corresponding polarization position angle of about 96{\deg} , that is possibly attributed to scattering within the quasar's wind. Finally, our model predicts the existence of a second peak in polarized flux in the far-ultraviolet, a telltale signature that could definitively prove the presence of a binary SMBH.</description>

      <title>Bullet shooting cloud-cloud collision in MIR bubble N65</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report that the formation of the twin-bubble system N65 and N65bis may be caused by the cloud-cloud collision (CCC) from the Bullet Nebula. The blue-shifted $^{13}$CO gas component (N65a [47, 55] km s$^{-1}$) is associated with the twin-bubble system, while the red-shifted $^{13}$CO gas component (N65b [55, 62] km s$^{-1}$) is linked to the Bullet Nebula. The distinct signatures of CCC, such as the bridge feature, the U-shape cavity and the complementary distribution with displacement, are found between N65a and N65b. The collision timescale is estimated to be 1.15 to 2.0 Myr, which is consistent with the dynamical ages of the two \HII regions in N65a (0.73 Myr for N65bis and 1.19 Myr for N65, respectively), indicating their CCC-related origin. A total of 354 young stellar objects (YSOs) are founded, which are clustered into eight MST (Minimum Spinning Tree) groups. The distribution of M1 (at the post-frontal edge) and M2, M3, M4 (at the pre-frontal edge) suggests that the CCC triggers star formation along the collision path of $b=0^{\circ}.35$, with younger YSOs present at the pre-frontal edge. Therefore, the bipolar morphology of the twin-bubble system can be interpreted by the collision of N65a and N65b along $b=0^{\circ}.35$ about 2 Myr ago.</description>

      <title>Automated quasar continuum estimation using neural networks: a comparative study of deep-learning architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Ongoing and upcoming large spectroscopic surveys are drastically increasing the number of observed quasar spectra, requiring the development of fast and accurate automated methods to estimate spectral continua. Aims. This study evaluates the performance of three neural networks (NN) - an autoencoder, a convolutional NN (CNN), and a U-Net - in predicting quasar continua within the rest-frame wavelength range of $1020~\text{\AA}$ to $2000~\text{\AA}$. The ability to generalize and predict galaxy continua within the range of $3500~\text{\AA}$ to $5500~\text{\AA}$ is also tested. Methods. The performance of these architectures is evaluated using the absolute fractional flux error (AFFE) on a library of mock quasar spectra for the WEAVE survey, and on real data from the Early Data Release observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS). Results. The autoencoder outperforms the U-Net, achieving a median AFFE of 0.009 for quasars. The best model also effectively recovers the Ly$\alpha$ optical depth evolution in DESI quasar spectra. With minimal optimization, the same architectures can be generalized to the galaxy case, with the autoencoder reaching a median AFFE of 0.014 and reproducing the D4000n break in DESI and VIPERS galaxies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the bimodality of galactic habitability in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of galaxies to host habitable planets is central to astrobiology, tightly linked to galaxy-scale evolution and cosmological processes. Using IllustrisTNG, we revisit the proposed local peak in the mass-metallicity relation for small, metal-rich, star-forming galaxies (Cloudlet) as an indicator of enhanced galactic habitability. We refine the earlier analysis by applying updated filtering criteria to identify a more refined sample, further selecting objects based on their history. This process resulted in a confirmed sample of 97 dwarf galaxies, alongside 519 additional structures of uncertain origin, potentially comprising both numerical artefacts and unrecognised physical systems. Under these stricter conditions, the proposed bimodality in galactic habitability is strongly diminished. However, the astrobiological potential of metal-rich dwarfs, most of which are compact remnants of more massive galaxies that underwent tidal stripping, is a thrilling area of exploration. Although dense stellar environments are traditionally seen as inhospitable, recent studies highlight the role of dynamic environments in enhancing the distribution of biological material. Furthermore, the potential habitability of tidal structures formed in the aftermath of galactic interactions is a fascinating possibility. Our findings suggest that non-traditional structures support conditions favourable for life, opening up exciting new avenues for astrobiological research. This research underscores the need for a holistic approach to studying habitability that moves beyond planetary and stellar-focused frameworks to incorporate the broader galactic environment. Understanding the interactions between galaxies, their evolution, and the influence of their surroundings is essential to developing a more comprehensive model of how and where life might emerge and persist across the Universe.</description>

      <title>Search for dwarf galaxies in the southwestern sector of the Local cosmic void</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a search for new dwarf galaxies in a direction towards the southwestern part of the Local Void using the data on DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. In a sky area of $\sim1000$ square degrees, we discovered 12 candidates to nearby dwarfs with a high confidence. Four of them are probable new companions to the nearby galaxy M\,83 and others are isolated objects. We found also 20 nearby dwarf candidates with a low confidence. Almost all of the detected galaxies are classified as late type dwarfs. A new cluster of bluish stars with an angular diameter of 0.9$^{\prime}$ is revealed by us at a high galactic latitude, $b = 29^{\circ}$. Being at a distance of $\sim70$ kpc, it can be a globular cluster associated with the Milky Way stellar stream Sagittarius dSph or a new ultra-faint satellite of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>PRIMAGAL: a PRIMAger Galactic Plane Far-IR polarization survey to quantify the magnetic fields' role in the formation and evolution of large star-forming filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PRIMAger instrument on board the proposed PRIMA satellite will offer the unprecedented capability to obtain hundreds of square-degree maps in polarised emission at sub-arcminute resolution in four Far-IR bands. This will open a unique window to study magnetic fields in our Galaxy. PRIMAGAL, a proposed survey of polarized dust emission in the Milky Way Galactic Plane will determine the strength and orientation of magnetic fields towards several thousands of filamentary clouds in a wide range of linear masses, column densities, evolution, star-formation rates and efficiencies, and Galactic environment. This survey will address for the first time in a statistically significant fashion the role that magnetic fields play in shaping the formation, evolution and fragmentation of dense ISM filaments down to a minimum scale of 0.4 pc up to 8 kpc distance from the Sun. A 4-band polarization survey of the Galactic Plane with |b|&lt;1{\deg} (a total of 720 sq. deg.) can be executed by PRIMAger in about 1200 hours including all mapping and instrument overhead.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Miracle: A Remarkably Luminous Galaxy at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44$ Confirmed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly early epochs, $z&gt;10$, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the most distant example of this class yet -- MoM-z14, a luminous ($M_{\rm{UV}}=-20.2$) source in the COSMOS legacy field at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-$\alpha$ break and $\approx3\sigma$ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright $z_{\rm{spec}}\approx14-15$ sources implied by our "Mirage or Miracle" survey spanning $\approx350$ arcmin$^{2}$ is $&gt;100\times$ larger ($182^{+329}_{-105}\times$) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines (${\approx}15{-}35$ \AA) signal a rising star-formation history, with a ${\approx}10\times$ increase in the last 5 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{\rm{5Myr}}}/\rm{SFR_{\rm{50Myr}}}=9.9^{+3.0}_{-5.8}$). The source is extremely compact (circularized $r_{\rm{e}} = 74^{+15}_{-12}$ pc), and yet resolved, suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of light. The steep UV slope ($\beta=-2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing may indicate that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 are partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a $\approx100\%$ neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]$&gt;1$ hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.</description>

      <title>On the dark matter formation scenario of NGC 4147</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results on the radial velocity dispersion profile built out to the outskirts of NGC 4147, a Milky Way globular cluster with detected strong tidal tails. The cluster was chosen to probe, from an observational point of view, recent simulations that suggest that rising velocity dispersion profiles at large distance from the clusters' centers would be seen in globular clusters without tidal tails. From GEMINI@GMOS spectra, centered in the infrared CaII triplet region, of selected stars located along the onset of NGC 4147's tidal tails, we measured their radial velocities and overall metallicities. The derived metallicities were used to ultimately assessing on the highly-ranked cluster candidates of 9 stars, located between ~ 7 and 33 pc from the cluster's center, suitable for testing the aforementioned simulations. We complemented the present radial velocities with others available in the literature for cluster's members, and built a cluster velocity dispersion profile which suggests a mostly flat or slightly rising profile at large distances from the cluster's center. This outcome confirms that kinematically hot outermost cluster's stars are seen in NGC 4147, which disproves the recent model predictions. Nevertheless, the mean velocity dispersion of the outermost cluster's stars agrees with NGC 4147 being formed in a 10^8-10^9Mo dwarf galaxy with a cored dark matter profile that later was accreted on to the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>EMU/GAMA: A new approach to characterising radio luminosity functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study characterises the radio luminosity functions (RLFs) for SFGs and AGN using statistical redshift estimation in the absence of comprehensive spectroscopic data. Sensitive radio surveys over large areas detect many sources with faint optical and infrared counterparts, for which redshifts and spectra are unavailable. This challenges our attempt to understand the population of radio sources. Statistical tools are often used to model parameters (such as redshift) as an alternative to observational data. Using the data from GAMA G23 and EMU early science observations, we explore simple statistical techniques to estimate the redshifts in order to measure the RLFs of the G23 radio sources as a whole and for SFGs and AGN separately. Redshifts and AGN/SFG classifications are assigned statistically for those radio sources without spectroscopic data. The calculated RLFs are compared with existing studies, and the results suggest that the RLFs match remarkably well for low redshift galaxies with an optical counterpart. We use a more realistic high redshift distribution to model the redshifts of (most likely) high redshift radio sources and find that the LFs from our approach match well with measured LFs. We also look at strategies to compare the RLFs of radio sources without an optical counterpart to existing studies.</description>

      <title>Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee: Final Report and Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is poised to revolutionize our scientific understanding of exoplanets, dark matter, dark energy, and general astrophysics, including through an innovative community approach to defining and executing sky surveys. The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer in Tidally Heated Stars Orbiting Massive Black Holes and Implications for Repeating Nuclear Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of stars orbiting close to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be dramatically modified by tidal heating, which can in principle dissipate an energy much larger than the stellar binding energy. We use analytic models and MESA to explore the coupled dynamics of tidal heating, stellar structural evolution, orbital decay due to gravitational waves and tides, and mass transfer due to Roche lobe overflow. In contrast to more equal mass stellar binaries, the stable mass transfer rate for stars orbiting SMBHs is typically set by the tidal heating timescale (the timescale for tides to increase the stellar radius), not by the gravitational wave orbital decay timescale. The resulting stable mass transfer rate is sensitive to the tidal heating model but is plausibly $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-5} M_\odot {\, \rm yr^{-1}}$ (and perhaps larger), sufficient to produce low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in many galaxies. The stability of mass transfer is sensitive to where in the stellar interior the tidal energy is dissipated. MESA models confirm the expected result that mass transfer is unstable (stable) if tidal heating increases (decreases) the fraction of the star that is convective. More detailed conclusions about the stability of mass-transfer will require self-consistently calculating how the tidal heating of stars changes in response to internal structural changes produced by the tidal heating itself. Stars with tidal heating-induced mass transfer can produce a large population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei; they may also be the progenitors of some partial tidal disruption candidates (e.g., ASASSN-14ko) as well as short period quasi-periodic eruptions (e.g., eRO-QPE2 and GSN 069). However, many repeating nuclear transients produced by tidal heating-induced mass loss are likely fainter than those detected thus far, and remain to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Detection with Microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microlensing is the method of exoplanet detection that discovers solar system analog exoplanets. These are planets low in mass located in wide orbits around their host stars. Even though thousands of exoplanets are discovered, they are mostly hot planets close to their hosts. There is a dearth of exoplanets discovered beyond the snowline where exoplanets are thought to be formed. This was recognized as a very important science issue; 2010 decadal survey declared detecting exoplanets with microlensing and measuring their masses as one of the three main science goals of NASA's next flagship mission, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is scheduled to launch in late 2026, no later than May 2027. It will observe 6 seasons of galactic bulge to discover and measure masses of 1000+ such wide orbit low mass solar system analog planets.</description>

      <title>First JWST/NIRSpec Spectroscopy of O Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining how much mass is removed by stellar winds is crucial to understanding massive star evolution and feedback. However, traditional spectroscopic diagnostics in the UV and optical are not sensitive enough to characterize weak stellar winds of OB stars in low-metallicity environments. A new tool to access weak stellar winds is provided by spectroscopy in the infrared (IR). Stellar atmosphere models indicate that the hydrogen Br$\alpha$ line at $\lambda$\,4.05\,$\mu$m is a useful mass-loss rate indicator, particularly at low metallicity. The unprecedented capabilities of the NIRSpec spectrograph on board of the \emph{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) allow us to measure this line in spectra of massive stars in other galaxies. In this work, we present the first NIRSpec spectra of O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which has a metallicity of only 20\% Solar. Our sample consists of thirteen stars with spectral types ranging from O2 to O9.5 including supergiants, giants, and dwarfs. The stars belong to NGC\,346, the most massive young cluster in the SMC. We describe the observing strategy and data reduction, highlighting the treatment of the nebular background emission. The spectra cover the 2.8--5.1 $\mu$m wavelength range, and we detect the Br$\alpha$ line in emission in each of our sample stars. Using a combination of spectral and photometric data ranging from the UV to the IR, we improve the measurements of stellar luminosity and reddening. A first qualitative comparison of the observed Br$\alpha$ line with stellar atmosphere models shows its potential as a wind diagnostic for weak-winded stars.</description>

      <title>Manifold dynamics and orbital properties in a two-dimensional galactic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the orbital dynamics of a two-dimensional galactic model, emphasizing the influence of stable and unstable manifolds on the evolution of orbits. In our analysis we use evaluations of the system's Lagrangian descriptors to reveal the structure and location of manifolds. In addition, we perform extensive computations of the forward and backward in time evolution of ensembles of orbits, which allow us to study the future and past dynamics of the model by constructing its so-called origin-fate maps. Focusing on the properties of the escape of orbits from the central regions of the model's configuration space, we analyze various aspects of the orbits' evolutions, like the time an orbit needs to escape from the central region, the total time it spends at the exterior areas of the galaxy, as well as the number of its escapes and reentries from and to the central region. Furthermore, we follow the past and future evolution of orbits keeping track of the regions from which they leave the central parts of the galaxy, and relate different orbital behaviors with the enhancement of specific morphological features in the system's configuration space. Our results indicate that the stable (unstable) manifolds mainly influence the orbital characteristics of the model in the future (past).</description>

Abstract: The so-called "Giant Arc" is a sparse pattern of MgII absorbers spanning approximately 740 comoving Mpc, whose discovery has been claimed to contradict the large-scale homogeneity inherent to the standard cosmological model. We previously showed that, with the same algorithm and parameters used for its discovery, very similar patterns are abundant in uniform random distributions, and among equivalent halo samples in a cosmological simulation of the standard model. In a response, the original discoverers of the "Giant Arc" have argued that these parameters were only appropriate for their specific observational data, but that a smaller linking length should be used for control studies, in which case far fewer patterns are detected. We briefly review and disprove these arguments, and demonstrate that large patterns like the "Giant Arc" are indeed ubiquitous in a statistically homogeneous universe.</description>

      <title>Th/Eu abundance ratio of red giants in the Kepler Field</title>

Abstract: The r-process production in the early universe has been well constrained by the extensive studies of metal-poor stars. However, the r-process enrichment in the metal-rich regime is still not well understood. In this study, we examine the abundance ratios of Th and Eu, which represent the actinides and lanthanides, respectively, for a sample of metal-rich disk stars. Our sample covers 89 giant stars in the Kepler field with metallicities $-0.7 \leq \rm{[Fe/H]} \leq 0.4$ and ages from a few hundred Myr to $\sim 14$ Gyr. Age information for this sample is available from stellar seismology, which is essential for studying the radioactive element Th. We derive Th and Eu abundances through $\chi^2$ fitting of high-resolution archival spectra ($R \sim 80,000$) observed with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) at the Subaru Telescope. We create synthetic spectra for individual stars using a 1D LTE spectral synthesis code, Turbospectrum, adopting MARCS model atmospheres. Our study establishes the use of a less extensively studied Th II line at 5989 angstrom, carefully taking into account the blends of other spectral lines to derive the Th abundance. We successfully determine Eu abundance for 89 stars in our sample and Th for 81 stars. For the remaining 8 stars, we estimate the upper limits of Th abundance. After correcting the Th abundance for the decay, we find no correlation between $\rm{[Th/Eu]}$ and $\rm{[Fe/H]}$, which indicates that actinides production with respect to lanthanides does not depend on metallicity. On the other hand, we find a positive correlation of $\rm{[Th/Eu]}$ with age, with a slope of $0.10 \pm 0.04$. This may hint at the possibility that the dominant r-process sources are different between the early and late universe.</description>

      <title>The systemic recoil velocity distribution and the scale height of isolated millisecond pulsar systems: Implications on neutron star retention fractions in star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systemic recoil velocity ($v_\mathrm{sys}$) distribution of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is essential for understanding the MSP formation and estimating the retention fractions of MSPs in star clusters, which can potentially be determined with astrometric studies that take into account MSPs' long-term dynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled 65 isolated (or field) MSP systems (including lone MSPs) that are well astrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar (or space) velocities $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. We find that the observed Galactic-longitude components $v_\mathrm{l}$ of $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ can be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions. Assuming that 1) $v_\mathrm{l}$ are statistically stable over time (the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption), and 2) $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$ directions are uniformly distributed (the "isotropic-$\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$" assumption), the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian components. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption in the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current Galaxy-wide scale heights of isolated MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.66 kpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution, $\sim13$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster (GC) with the nominal 50 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of isolated MSP systems may account for the high number of MSPs discovered in GCs, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may follow the same formation channel(s) as isolated MSP systems.</description>

      <title>APE: An analytical protostellar environment to provide physical conditions to chemical models and synthetic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical modeling and synthetic observations are powerful methods to interpret observations, both requiring a knowledge of the physical conditions. In this paper, we present the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code, which aims at making chemical simulations and synthetic observations accessible. APE contains a physical model of protostellar evolution (including the central object, the envelope, the protoplanetary disk and the outflow) as well as interfaces to publicly available codes to perform chemical simulations, radiative transfer calculations, and synthetic interferometry imaging. APE produces density and temperature maps of protostellar systems. The code can also follow individual particles throughout their journey in a collapsing core. APE includes a treatment of the dust grain size-distribution to compute opacities self-consistently for subsequent radiative transfer. We show an example of application of APE by computing chemical abundance maps of CO, CN, CS, H2CO, and CH3OH in a Class I protostellar system. We also performed synthetic ALMA observations of their molecular emission assuming an edge-on source inclination. The moment 0 maps of CO, CS, and H2CO display an X-shaped emission similar to what is observed toward the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247.</description>

      <title>FUOr-Aur 0544+3330: A New YSO Outburst in the Outskirts of Auriga OB1, Viewed Face-On</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a newly appreciated FU Ori outburst event that began in 2019 and reached a peak in early 2021. Suspected young stellar object WISE J054452.25+333009.6 experienced substantial brightening, in excess of $-5$ mag at optical wavelengths and $-2.5$ mag at mid-infrared wavelengths. The time from near-quiescence to peak brightness was approximately 24 months. Optical and near-infrared spectra confirm that the outbursting source (hereby designated FUOr-Aur 0544+3330) shows all the hallmarks of the FU Ori class, including the Li I indicator of stellar youth. The mix of ionized and neutral atomic lines, alongside prominent molecular absorption features, is consistent with the expected change in spectral type from earlier in the optical to later-type in the near-infrared. The closest analog among well-studied FU Ori objects is V1515 Cyg. Both sources have unusually narrow-lined absorption spectra that can be explained by a face-on disk orientation, such that disk-broadening is minimized and wind-induced blueshift (in e.g. H$\alpha$, NaD, Ca II) is maximized. Both the optical through infrared spectral energy distribution and high-resolution spectrum are well-fit by a pure-accretion disk model. Adopting a distance of $d=1.5$ kpc, the accretion and central star parameters are: $\dot{M} = 10^{-5.48}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $M_* = 0.17 \ M_\odot$, and $R_\mathrm{inner} = 1.04 \ R_\odot$. Other fitted values are disk inclination $i=5.9$ deg and source extinction $A_V=1.83$ mag. These parameters yield accretion luminosity $L_\mathrm{acc} = 8.4\ L_\odot$ and maximum disk temperature $T_{\rm{max}} = 6218$ K.</description>

      <title>Population III star formation in the presence of turbulence, magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence, magnetic fields and radiation feedback are key components that shape the formation of stars, especially in the metal-free environments at high redshifts where Population III stars form. Yet no 3D numerical simulations exist that simultaneously take all of these into account. We present the first suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code FLASH as part of the POPSICLE project. We include both turbulent magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback coupled to primordial chemistry, and resolve the collapse of primordial clouds down to few au. We find that dynamically strong magnetic fields significantly slow down accretion onto protostars, while ionizing feedback, as expected, is largely unable to weaken gas accretion at early times. This is because the partially ionized H II region gets trapped near the star due to insufficient radiative outputs from the star. The maximum stellar mass in the HD and RHD simulations that only yield one star exceeds $100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ within the first $5000\,\rm{yr}$. However, in the corresponding MHD and RMHD runs, the maximum mass of Population III stars is only $60\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$. In other realizations where we observe widespread fragmentation leading to the formation of Population III star clusters, the maximum stellar mass is further reduced by a factor of few due to fragmentation-induced starvation. We thus show that magnetic fields are more important than ionizing feedback in regulating the mass of the star during the earliest stages of Population III star formation.</description>

      <title>ProGeny I: a new simple stellar population spectra generator and impact of isochrones / stellar atmospheres / initial mass functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce ProGeny, a new stellar population library (SPL) software package written in R. This release encapsulates the core software (github.com/asgr/ProGeny) to generate simple/single stellar populations and their associated spectra (SSPs); the various data inputs required (in particular isochrones and stellar atmospheres); example scripts to generate the SSPs; and a number of pre-generated static SSP available for immediate use. The most novel feature of ProGeny is its ability to produce SSPs with evolving initial mass functions, allowing functional dependencies on stellar age or metallicity. We perform both internal comparisons (within the ProGeny SPL) and external comparisons (with other public SSPs) and tests. The main conclusion is that the choice of isochrone has significantly more impact on the predicted spectra than the choice of stellar atmospheres and/or IMF (comparing Chabrier and Kroupa variants). A number of limiting uncertainties and corrections for star formation rates and stellar masses are also presented.</description>

      <title>Understanding Galaxy Morphology Evolution Through Cosmic Time via Redshift Conditioned Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Redshift measures the distance to galaxies and underlies our understanding of the origin of the Universe and galaxy evolution. Spectroscopic redshift is the gold-standard method for measuring redshift, but it requires about $1000$ times more telescope time than broad-band imaging. That extra cost limits sky coverage and sample size and puts large spectroscopic surveys out of reach. Photometric redshift methods rely on imaging in multiple color filters and template fitting, yet they ignore the wealth of information carried by galaxy shape and structure. We demonstrate that a diffusion model conditioned on continuous redshift learns this missing joint structure, reproduces known morphology-$z$ correlations. We verify on the HyperSuprime-Cam survey, that the model captures redshift-dependent trends in ellipticity, semi-major axis, S\'ersic index, and isophotal area that these generated images correlate closely with true redshifts on test data. To our knowledge this is the first study to establish a direct link between galaxy morphology and redshift. Our approach offers a simple and effective path to redshift estimation from imaging data and will help unlock the full potential of upcoming wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>Tracing the galaxy-halo connection with galaxy clustering in COSMOS-Web from z = 0.1 to z ~ 12</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the evolving relationship between galaxies and their dark matter halos from $z \sim 0.1$ to $z \sim 12$ using mass-limited angular clustering measurements in the 0.54 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS-Web survey. This study provides the first measurements of the mass-limited two-point correlation function at $z \ge 10$ and a consistent analysis spanning 13.4 Gyr of cosmic history, setting new benchmarks for future simulations and models. Using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, we derive characteristic halo masses and the stellar-to-halo mass relationship (SHMR) across redshifts and stellar mass bins. Our results first indicate that HOD models fit data at $z \ge 2.5$ best when incorporating a non-linear scale-dependent halo bias, boosting clustering at non-linear scales (r = 10-100 kpc). We find that galaxies at z &gt; 10.5 with $\log(M_\star / M_\odot) \ge 8.85$ are hosted by halos with $M_{\rm h} \sim 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$, achieving a star formation efficiency (SFE) $M_\star / (f_b M_{\rm h}) $ up to 1 dex higher than at $z \le 1$. The high galaxy bias at $z \ge 8$ suggests that these galaxies reside in massive halos with intrinsic high SFE. Our SHMR evolves significantly with redshift, starting high at $z \ge 10.5$, decreasing until $z \sim 2 - 3$, then increasing again until the present. Current simulations fail to reproduce both massive high-$z$ galaxies and this evolution, while semi-empirical models linking SFE to halo mass, accretion rates, and redshift align with our findings. We propose that $z &gt; 8$ galaxies experience bursty star formation without significant feedback altering their growth, driving the rapid growth of massive galaxies observed by JWST. Over time, increasing feedback efficiency and exponential halo growth suppress star formation. At $z \sim 2 - 3$ and after, halo growth slows down while star formation continues, supported by gas reservoirs in halos.</description>

      <title>The Rich JWST Spectrum of the Western Nucleus of Arp 220: Shocked Hot Core Chemistry Dominates the Inner Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present full 3-28 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of $T_\mathrm{d} \gtrsim 500~\mathrm{K}$, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 $\mathrm{\mu m}$, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C$_2$H$_2$, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature $T_\mathrm{rot} = 330~\mathrm{K}$, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 $\mathrm{pc}$ core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. Despite the molecular material's close proximity to the central source, no evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.</description>

      <title>JADES: Nitrogen Enhancement in High-Redshift Broad-Line Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unexpectedly high nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios observed in high-redshift (z) galaxies have challenged our understanding of early star formation. Notably, many of these nitrogen-rich galaxies show signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), suggesting a possible connection between black hole formation and nitrogen enrichment. To explore this connection, we analyse stacked spectra of z=4-7 broad-line and narrow-line AGNs using deep NIRSpec data from the JADES survey. We identify a significant Niii] quintuplet and a high electron density ($\sim10^{4}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) only in the broad-line AGN stack, indicating nitrogen-rich ($\log(\mathrm{N/C})\simeq0.5$, $\log(\mathrm{N/O})&gt;-0.6$) and dense gas similar to the high-z nitrogen-rich galaxies. Our findings suggest that dense nuclear star formation may trap nitrogen-rich gas in proto-globular clusters, in line with the high N/O observed in local globular clusters; associated runaway stellar collisions could produce intermediate-mass black hole seeds, as predicted by some models and simulations, whose accretion results into AGN signatures. These findings support scenarios connecting the early black hole seeding and growth to merging processes within and between proto-globular clusters in primeval galaxies.</description>

      <title>Rendezvous in CAVITY: Kinematics and gas properties of an isolated dwarf-dwarf merging pair in a cosmic void region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are pivotal events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, with their impact believed to be particularly significant in dwarf galaxies. We report the serendipitous identification of an isolated merging dwarf system with a total stellar mass of M$_{\rm \star}$$\sim$10$^{9.7}$M$_{\rm \odot}$, located in the centre of a cosmic void. This system is one of the rare examples, and possibly the first, of merging dwarf galaxy pairs studied within the central region of a cosmic void. Using CAVITY PPAK-IFU data combined with deep optical broadband imaging from the Isaac Newton Telescope, we analysed the kinematics and ionized gas properties of each dwarf galaxy in the system by employing a full spectral fitting technique. The orientation of this merging pair relative to the line of sight allowed us to determine the dynamical mass of each component, showing that both had similar dynamical masses within galactocentric distances of up to 2.9 kpc. While the gas-phase metallicity of both components is consistent with that of star-forming dwarf galaxies, the star formation rates observed in both components exceed those typically reported for equally massive star-forming dwarf galaxies. This indicates that the merger has presumably contributed to enhancing star formation. Furthermore, we found no significant difference in the optical g-r colour of this merging pair compared to other merging dwarf pairs across different environments. While most merging events occur in group-like environments with high galaxy density and the tidal influence of a host halo, and isolated mergers typically involve galaxies with significant mass differences, the identified merging pair does not follow these patterns. We speculate that the global dynamics of the void or past three-body encounters involving components of this pair and a nearby dwarf galaxy might have triggered this merging event.</description>

      <title>The AGORA High-Resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project VII: Satellite quenching in zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-mass halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Satellite galaxies experience multiple physical processes when interacting with their host halos, often leading to the quenching of star formation. In the Local Group (LG), satellite quenching has been shown to be highly efficient, affecting nearly all satellites except the most massive ones. While recent surveys are studying Milky Way (MW) analogs to assess how representative our LG is, the dominant physical mechanisms behind satellite quenching in MW-mass halos remain under debate. Aims: We analyze satellite quenching within the same MW-mass halo, simulated using various widely-used astrophysical codes, each using different hydrodynamic methods and implementing different supernovae feedback recipes. The goal is to determine whether quenched fractions, quenching timescales and the dominant quenching mechanisms are consistent across codes or if they show sensitivity to the specific hydrodynamic method and supernovae (SNe) feedback physics employed. Methods: We use a subset of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a MW-mass halo from the multiple-code AGORA CosmoRun suite. Results: We find that the quenched fraction is consistent with the latest SAGA survey results within its 1$\sigma$ host-to-host scatter across all the models. Regarding quenching timescales, all the models reproduce the trend observed in the ELVES survey, LG observations, and previous simulations: the less massive the satellite, the shorter its quenching timescale. All our models converge on the dominant quenching mechanisms: strangulation halts cold gas accretion and ram pressure stripping is the predominant mechanism for gas removal, particularly effective in satellites with $M_* &lt; 10^8\, M_\odot$. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the stripping mechanisms differs among the codes, showing a strong sensitivity to the different SNe feedback implementations and/or hydrodynamic methods employed.</description>

      <title>First confirmation of anisotropic halo bias from statistically anisotropic matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12004v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confirm for the first time the existence of distinctive halo bias associated with the quadrupolar type of statistical anisotropy (SA) of the linear matter density field using cosmological $N$-body simulations. We find that the coefficient of the SA-induced bias for cluster-sized halos takes negative values and exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing halo mass. This results in the quadrupole halo power spectra in a statistically anisotropic universe being less amplified compared to the monopole spectra. The anisotropic feature in halo bias that we found presents a promising new tool for testing the hypothesis of a statistically anisotropic universe, with significant implications for the precise verification of anisotropic inflation scenarios and vector dark matter and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Classics: On the Optical Colours of Novae as Standard Crayons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the $BVRI$ colours of novae over the course of their eruptions. Where possible, interstellar reddening was measured using the equivalent widths of Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs). Some novae lack spectra with sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise ratios; therefore, we supplement as necessary with 3D and 2D dust maps. Utilising only novae with DIB- or 3D-map-based $E(B-V)$, we find an average intrinsic $(B-V)_0$ colour of novae at $V$-band light curve peak of 0.20 with a standard deviation of 0.31, based on 25 novae. When the light curve has declined by 2 magnitudes ($t_2$), we find an average $(B-V)_0 = -0.03$ with a standard deviation of 0.19. These average colours are consistent with previous findings, although the spreads are larger than previously found due to more accurate reddening estimates. We also examined the intrinsic $(R-I)_0$ and $(V-R)_0$ colours across our sample. These colours behave similarly to $(B-V)_0$, except that the $(V-R)_0$ colour gets redder after peak, likely due to the contributions of emission line flux. We searched for correlations between nova colours and $t_2$, peak $V$-band absolute magnitude, and GeV $\gamma$-ray luminosity, but find no statistically significant correlations. Nova colours can therefore be used as standard ``crayons" to estimate interstellar reddening from photometry alone, with 0.2--0.3 mag uncertainty. We present a novel Bayesian strategy for estimating distances to Galactic novae based on these $E(B-V)$ measurements, independent of assumptions about luminosity, built using 3D dust maps and a stellar mass model of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Light curves and spectra for stellar collisions between main-sequence stars in galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05265v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiative-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright ultraviolet (UV) flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>The Use of Binary Black Holes Merging in AGN Disks for Hubble Constant Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of environmental effects on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole mergers residing in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) near the central supermassive black hole. Using the potential hierarchical triple merger candidate GW190514-GW190521 in AGN J124942.3+344929 with its electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr as a multimessenger case study, we demonstrate that environmental effects can be negligible for mergers at approximately tens to hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole. We find $H_0=40.9_{-8.9}^{+19.3}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (median and 68\% credible interval) under a flat prior and flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Incorporating GW170817 prior information improves constraints to $H_0=68.8_{-6.0}^{+7.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We suggest that in general, AGN environments could serve as viable laboratories for cosmological studies from GW observations where environmental effects remain below detection thresholds.</description>
