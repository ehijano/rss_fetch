      <title>Four-manifolds defined by vector-colorings of simple polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on the real moment-angle manifold $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P$ over a simple $n$-polytope $P$. The orbit space $N(P,H)=\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ has an action of $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$. For general $n$ we introduce the notion of a Hamiltonian $\mathcal{C}(n,k)$-subcomplex generalizing the three-dimensional notions of a Hamiltonian cycle, theta- and $K_4$-subgraphs. Each $\mathcal{C}(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset \partial P$ corresponds to a subgroup $H_C$ such that $N(P,H_C)\simeq S^n$. We prove that in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. Any subgroup $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ defines a complex $\mathcal{C}(P,H)\subset \partial P$. We prove that each Hamiltonian $\mathcal{C}(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset \mathcal{C}(P,H)$ inducing $H$ corresponds to a hyperelliptic involution $\tau_C\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ on the manifold $N(P,H)$ (that is, an involution with the orbit space homeomorphic to $S^n$) and in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. We prove that for the geometries $\mathbb X= \mathbb S^4$, $\mathbb S^3\times\mathbb R$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb S^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb R^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb L^2$, and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb L^2$ there exists a compact right-angled $4$-polytope $P$ with a free action of $H$ such that the geometric manifold $N(P,H)$ has a hyperelliptic involution in $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, and for $\mathbb X=\mathbb R^4$, $\mathbb L^4$, $\mathbb L^3\times \mathbb R$ and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb R^2$ there are no such polytopes.</description>

      <title>No quasi-isomorphism between a minimal Sullivan algebra of non-finite type and its realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the morphisms from a minimal Sullivan algebra of non-finite type to the algebra of polynomial differential forms on its realization cannot be quasi-isomorphic. This provides a positive answer to a question posed by F\'elix, Halperin and Thomas. Furthermore, we give some discussion about the relationship between the homotopy groups of a topological space and its minimal Sullivan model.</description>

      <title>On Hopkins' Picard group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the algebraic Picard group of the category of $K(n)$-local spectra, for all heights $n$ and all primes $p$. In particular, we show that it is always finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and, whenever $n \geq 2$, is of rank $2$, thereby confirming a prediction made by Hopkins in the early 1990s. In fact, with the exception of the anomalous case $n=p=2$, we provide a full set of topological generators for these groups. Our arguments rely on recent advances in $p$-adic geometry to translate the problem to a computation on Drinfeld's symmetric space, which can then be solved using results of Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian elements in algebraic K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recall that topological complex $K$-theory associates to an isomorphism class of a complex vector bundle $E$ over a space $X$ an element of the complex $K$-theory group of $X$. Or from algebraic $K$-theory perspective, one assigns a homotopy class $[X \to K (\mathcal{K})]$, where $\mathcal{K}$ is the ring of compact operators on the Hilbert space. We show that there is an analogous story for algebraic $K$-theory of a general commutative ring $k$, replacing complex vector bundles by certain Hamiltonian fiber bundles. The construction actually first assigns elements in a certain categorified algebraic $K$-theory, analogous to To\"en's secondary $K$-theory of $k$. And there is a natural map from this categorified algebraic $K$-theory to the classical variant.</description>

      <title>Spin cobordism and the gauge group of type I/heterotic string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cobordism offers an unique perspective into the non-perturbative sector of string theory by demanding the absence of higher form global symmetries for quantum gravitational consistency. In this work we compute the spin cobordism groups of the classifying space of $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ relevant to describing type I/heterotic string theory and explore their (shared) non-perturbative sector. To facilitate this we leverage our knowledge of type I D-brane physics behind the related ko-homology. The computation utilizes several established tools from algebraic topology, the focus here is on two spectral sequences. First, the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence is used to obtain the cohomology of the classifying space of the $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients. This will enable us to start the Adams spectral sequence for finally obtaining our result, the spin cobordism groups. We conclude by providing a string theoretic interpretation to the cobordism groups.</description>

      <title>Many partitions of mass assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, extending the recent work of authors with Calles Loperena and Dimitrijevi\'c Blagojevi\'c, we give a general and complete treatment of a problem of partition of mass assignments with prescribed arrangements of hyperplanes on Euclidean vector bundles. Using a new configuration test map scheme, as well as an alternative topological framework, we are able to reprove known results, extend them to arbitrary bundles as well as to put various types of constraints on the solutions. Moreover, the developed topological methods allow us to give new proofs and extend results of Guth and Katz, Schnider, and Sober\'on and Takahashi. In this way we place all these results under one ``roof''.</description>

      <title>On diagonal digraphs, Koszul algebras and triangulations of homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is devoted to the study of diagonal digraphs, i.e. digraphs whose magnitude homology is concentrated on the diagonal. For a digraph $G$ and $\ell\geq 2,$ we describe a condition, denoted by $(\mathcal{V}_\ell)$, equivalent to vanishing of the second magnitude homology group ${\rm MH}_{2,k}(G,\mathbb{Z})$ for all $k&gt;\ell.$ In particular, diagonal digraphs satisfy $(\mathcal{V}_2).$ As a corollary we obtain that the 2-dimensional CW-complex obtained from a diagonal undirected graph by attaching 2-cells to all squares and triangles of the graph is simply connected. We also give an interpretation of diagonality in terms of Koszul algebras: a digraph $G$ is diagonal if and only if the distance algebra $\sigma G$ is Koszul for any ground field; and if and only if $G$ satisfies $(\mathcal{V}_2)$ and the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is Koszul for any ground field. To obtain a source of examples of digraphs, we study the extended Hasse diagram $\hat G_K$ of a pure simplicial complex $K$. For a triangulation $K$ of a topological manifold $M,$ we express the non-diagonal part of the magnitude homology of $\hat G_K$ via the homology of $M$. As a corollary we obtain that, if $K$ is a triangulation of a closed manifold $M$, then $\hat G_K$ is diagonal if and only if $M$ is a homology sphere.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of the Rips complexes of Integer lattices via local domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each positive integer $n$, the Rips complexes of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice in the $d_1$ metric (i.e., the Manhattan metric, also called the natural word metric in the Cayley graph) are contractible at scales above $n^2(2n-1)$, with the bounds arising from the Jung's constants. We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension $n$ and a fixed scale $r$, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for $n=1,2,3$, the Rips complex of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to $n$ is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions $n$</description>
