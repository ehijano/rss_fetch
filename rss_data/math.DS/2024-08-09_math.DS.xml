      <title>On orbit complexity of dynamical systems: intermediate value property and level set related to a Furstenberg problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For symbolic dynamics with some mild conditions, we solve the lowering topological entropy problem for subsystems and determine the Hausdorff dimension of the level set with given complexity, where the complexity is represented by Hausdorff dimension of orbit closure. These results can be applied to some dynamical systems such as $\beta$-transformations, conformal expanding repeller, etc. We also determine the dimension of the Furstenberg level set, which is related to a problem of Furstenberg on the orbits under two multiplicatively independent maps.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modelling of the vitamin C clock reaction: a study of two kinetic regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemically reacting systems exhibiting a repeatable delay period before a visible and sudden change are referred to as clock reactions; they have a long history in education and provide an idealisation of various biochemical and industrial processes. We focus on a purely substrate-depletive clock reaction utilising vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, iodine and starch. Building on a recent study of a simplified two-reaction model under high hydrogen peroxide concentrations, we develop a more detailed model which breaks the slow reaction into two steps, one of which is rate-limiting unless hydrogen peroxide levels are very high. Through asymptotic analysis, this model enables the effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration to be elucidated in a principled way, resolving an apparent discrepancy with earlier literature regarding the order of the slow reaction kinetics. The model is analysed in moderate- and high-hydrogen peroxide regimes, providing approximate solutions and expressions for the switchover time which take into account hydrogen peroxide concentration. The solutions are validated through simultaneously fitting the same set of parameters to several experimental series, then testing on independent experiments across widely varying hydrogen peroxide concentration. The study thereby presents and further develops a validated mechanistic understanding of a paradigm chemical kinetics system.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on the dynamic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral techniques are popular and robust approaches to data analysis. A prominent example is the use of eigenvectors of a Laplacian, constructed from data affinities, to identify natural data groupings or clusters, or to produce a simplified representation of data lying on a manifold. This tutorial concerns the dynamic Laplacian, which is a natural generalisation of the Laplacian to handle data that has a time component and lies on a time-evolving manifold. In this dynamic setting, clusters correspond to long-lived ``coherent'' collections. We begin with a gentle recap of spectral geometry before describing the dynamic generalisations. We also discuss computational methods and the automatic separation of many distinct features through the SEBA algorithm. The purpose of this tutorial is to bring together many results from the dynamic Laplacian literature into a single short document, written in an accessible style.</description>

      <title>Contraction and Synchronization in Reservoir Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the conditions under which global contraction manifests in the leaky continuous time reservoirs, thus guaranteeing Generalized Synchronization. Results on continuous time reservoirs make use of the logarithmic norm of the connectivity matrix. Further analysis yields some simple guidelines on how to better construct the connectivity matrix in these systems. Additionally, we outline how the Universal Approximation Property of discrete time reservoirs is readily satisfied by virtue of the activation function being contracting, and how continuous time reservoirs may inherit a limited form of universal approximation by virtue of them overlapping with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. The ability of the Reservoir Computing framework to universally approximate topological conjugates, along with their fast training, make them a compelling data-driven, black-box surrogate of dynamical systems, and a potential mechanism for developing digital twins.</description>

      <title>Force-Motion Control For A Six Degree-Of-Freedom Robotic Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified algorithm for motion and force control for a six degree-of-freedom spatial manipulator. The motion-force controller performs trajectory tracking, maneuvering the manipulator's end-effector through desired position, orientations and rates. When contacting an obstacle or target object, the force module of the controller restricts the manipulator movements with a novel force exertion method, which prevents damage to the manipulator, the end-effector, and the objects during the contact or collision. The core strategy presented in this paper is to design the linear acceleration for the end-effector which ensures both trajectory tracking and restriction of any contact force at the end-effector. The design of the controller is validated through numerical simulations and digital twin validation.</description>

      <title>The intrinsic reductions and the intrinsic depths in non-archimedean dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a rational function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ defined over an algebraically closed and complete non-archimedean non-trivially valued field $K$, we introduce the intrinsic reduction at each point in the Berkovich projective line and the directionwise intrinsic depth of it. After discussing the relationship between such an intrinsic reduction of $\phi$ and the classical reduction of $\phi$ modulo $K^{\circ\circ}$, we give as applications an intrinsic proof of Rumely's moduli theoretic characterization of the minimum resultant locus and a direct proof of the degenerating limit theorem of DeMarco--Faber for a meromorphic family of complex rational functions.</description>

      <title>Fourier Decay from $L^2$-Flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach for establishing rates of decay for the Fourier transform of a wide class of dynamically defined measures. Among the key features of the method is the systematic use of the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in \cite{Khalil-Mixing}, coupled with non-concentration estimates for the derivatives of the underlying dynamical system. This method yields polylogarithmic Fourier decay for Diophantine self-similar measures, and polynomial decay for Patterson-Sullivan measures of convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, Gibbs measures associated to non-integrable $C^2$ conformal systems, as well as stationary measures for carpet-like non-conformal iterated function systems. Applications include essential spectral gaps on convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, fractal uncertainty principles, and equidistribution properties of typical vectors in fractal sets.</description>

      <title>Flat structure of meromorphic connections on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.04901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible omega limit sets of simple geodesics for meromorphic connections on compact Riemann surfaces have been studied by Abate, Tovena and Bianchi. In this paper, we study the same problem for infinite self-intersecting geodesics. In the first part of the paper we study relation among meromorphic $k$-differentials, singular flat metrics and meromorphic connections. Moreover, we prove a Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem for infinite self-intersecting geodesics of meromorphic connections with monodromy in $G$, where $\arg G^k=\{0\}$ for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Propagating terrace in a two-tubes model of gravitational fingering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a semi-discrete model for the two-dimensional incompressible porous medium (IPM) equation describing gravitational fingering phenomenon. The model consists of a system of advection-reaction-diffusion equations on concentration, velocity and pressure, describing motion of miscible liquids under the Darcy's law in two vertical tubes (real lines) and interflow between them. Our analysis reveals the structure of gravitational fingers in this simple setting - the mixing zone consists of space-time regions of constant intermediate concentrations and the profile of propagation is characterized by two consecutive traveling waves which we call a terrace. We prove the existence of such a propagating terrace for the parameters corresponding to small distances between the tubes. This solution shows the possible mechanism of slowing down the fingers' growth due to convection in the transversal direction. The main tool in the proof is a reduction to pressure-free transverse flow equilibrium (TFE) model using geometrical singular perturbation theory and the persistence of stable and unstable manifolds under small perturbations.</description>
