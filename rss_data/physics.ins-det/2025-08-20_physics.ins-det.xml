      <title>Enhancing Neutron Measurement Accuracy with Bubble Detectors at Laser-Driven Neutron Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubble detectors are widely used to measure neutron flux from laser-driven sources employing a pitcher-catcher setup, due to their insensitivity to intense $\gamma$-ray backgrounds and strong electromagnetic pulses (EMP).\\ This paper presents a method to account for the neutron energy-dependent response of bubble detectors, enabling accurate conversion of bubble counts into neutron flux at the detector location. The proposed method is based on the accurate reconstruction of the response function using a surrogate model. The resulting model is convoluted with the (normalized) expected/measured neutron spectrum to obtain an effective measure of the bubble detector's response, herein referred to as effective $c$ or $c_\text{eff}$. This effective value for the response is energy-independent after the convolution. In this way, our approach includes the spectral distribution of neutrons arriving at the detector to determine the integral neutron flux. Analyzing our experimental results obtained at the DRACO PW laser and comparing the results to previously used methods to obtain neutron fluxes from bubble detectors returns a reduction in neutron flux of up to \SI{31}{\%}. Results from the method detailed in this paper agree with in-depth experimental setup Monte Carlo simulations, with deviations of less than \SI{10}{\%}. We furthermore discuss the inherent limitations of our method with regard to its uncertainty and highlight the influence of neutron scattering in bubble detector measurements. For our experimental setup at the DRACO laser, up to \SI{47}{\%} of the detected neutrons arrive at the detector after undergoing at least one scattering event.</description>

      <title>Development and testing of integrated readout electronics for next generation SiSeRO (Single electron Sensitive Read Out) devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first generation of Single electron Sensitive Read Out (SiSeRO) amplifiers, employed as on-chip charge detectors for charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have demonstrated excellent noise and spectral performance: a responsivity of around 800 pA per electron, an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 3.2 electrons root mean square (RMS), and a full width half maximum (FWHM) energy resolution of 130 eV at 5.9 keV for a readout speed of 625 Kpixel/s. Repetitive Non Destructive Readout (RNDR) has also been demonstrated with these devices, achieving an improved ENC performance of 0.36 electrons RMS after 200 RNDR cycles. In order to mature this technology further, Stanford University, in collaboration with MIT Kavli Institute and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, are developing new SiSeRO detectors with improved geometries that should enable greater responsivity and improved noise performance. These include CCD devices employing arrays of SiSeRO amplifiers to optimize high speed, low noise RNDR readout and a proof-of-concept SiSeRO active pixel sensor (APS). To read out these devices, our team has developed a compact, 8-channel, fast, low noise, low power application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) denoted the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC) that includes an experimental drain current readout mode intended for SiSeRO devices. In this paper, we present results from the first tests of SiSeRO CCD devices operating with MCRC readout, and our designs for next generation SiSeRO devices.</description>

      <title>Research on Ultrasonic Imaging Systems Based on Scattering Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an ultrasonic array system, increasing the aperture size to achieve a high resolution requires more transmit and receive channels, thus making it essential to have an analysis technique that can reconstruct the shape and physical properties of scatterers in a finite time based on measurement data obtained from numerous ultrasonic elements. Herein, we developed an ultrasound imaging technique using a two-dimensional ultrasonic array system comprising N^2 transmitter/receiver pairs and a technique for controlling it with a 2N-channel transmitter/receiver circuit. In addition, we derived a partial differential equation that describes wave propagation in the scattering field where the transmitter and receiver arrays are orthogonally arranged, based on scattering field theory. By analytically solving this equation, we derived an imaging function that incorporates the measurement data as boundary conditions. Moreover, we visualized the spatial distribution of reflection intensity corresponding to the target shape by measuring reflected waves from the target using this measurement system and performing reconstruction calculations based on scattering field theory. We demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasonic imaging by combining ultrasonic measurements using a smaller number of channels than the number of ultrasonic elements and scattering field theory and using the measurement results as boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Novel Limits on Dark Photon Mixing from Radiation Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose a novel laboratory search for dark photons based on radiation-safety monitoring at synchrotron radiation facilities, including NanoTerasu, SPring-8, KEK-PF, and ESRF. Dark photons can be produced parasitically in undulators or via photon-mirror interactions, and subsequently traverse optical systems and shielding. Taking into account quantum effects and the internal structure of undulators, mirrors, and detectors, I show that even a simple Geiger-M\"uller counter, routinely used for radiation-safety monitoring, can detect such dark photons outside the shielding and set competitive limits on the kinetic mixing parameter down to $\chi \lesssim 5\times 10^{-6}$ in the eV mass range, providing some of the strongest bounds among laboratory searches. Because radiation safety is strictly regulated, the resulting limits can be regarded as robust and realistic constraints.</description>

      <title>Species-Dependent Electron Emission from Nanoparticles under Gamma Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, various nanoparticle species-including Au and Gd$_2$O$_3$-were irradiated with low-energy gamma rays, such as 59.5 keV photons from $^{241}$Am. Pulse-height spectra were recorded using a liquid-scintillation counting system before and after dispersing the nanoparticles into the scintillator, and the differences between them were analyzed to infer the interaction outcomes. Gd$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles emitted numerous electrons; however, under identical experimental conditions, no detectable electron emission was observed from Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). Here, "detectable electron emission" refers to electrons with energies high enough to be registered by the liquid-scintillation detector used (approx 100 eV and, more typically, &gt;= 1-2 keV); however, it excludes electrons that may be emitted at lower energies. Thus, a species-dependent radiation-nanoparticle interaction was observed. Rigorous controls and falsification tests excluded various artefacts-including detector insensitivity, surface contamination, aggregation, quenching, and self-absorption-as causes for the absence of detectable electron emission from AuNPs. This observation potentially prompts a re-evaluation of the common assumption that nanoparticles behave like their bulk counterparts and emit electrons upon gamma-irradiation. Instead, our results suggest that the distinct internal environment of nanoparticles influences their interaction with radiation. These findings offer significant insights for practical applications, including a better mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle radiosensitization in cancer therapy, enhanced gamma-detection efficiency of organic scintillators, and the development of lightweight radiation shields.</description>

      <title>Mueller Matrix Polarimetry of Fiber Bragg Grating Strain and Torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a polarimetric dual-comb spectroscopy technique for simultaneous strain and torsion sensing using a single-cavity mode-locked fiber laser and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Dual-comb generation in a single-cavity fiber laser was achieved by utilizing a piece of high-birefringence fiber and adjusting the in-cavity polarization controller. Fast Fourier Transform analysis was applied to the time-domain Stokes parameters, enabling the detection of FBG spectral shifts induced by strain and torsion. To further enhance discrimination between strain and torsion, we applied a novel approach to extract Mueller matrix elements without using complex adjustable polarization components. We explored the analysis of polarimetric purity of the FBG's Mueller matrix in terms of polarizance, diattenuation, and structural polarization response as a function of FBG strain and torsion. The obtained results enabled the measurement of strain and torsion based on a single FBG, which paves the way for the development of cost-effective shape sensing technologies.</description>
