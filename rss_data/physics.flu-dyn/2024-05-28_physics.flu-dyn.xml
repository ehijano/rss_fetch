      <title>Analysis of thermochemical non-equilibrium hypersonic flow over a waverider with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to assess the impact of parameter uncertainty on hypersonic aerothermal surface heating predictions in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations using non-intrusive uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques. RANS-based models are considered indispensable tools in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis for the iterative and cost-effective exploration of innovative design concepts. However, these RANS models heavily rely on empirical constants that often require tuning due to the lack of physical knowledge and complexity of the problem, introducing significant uncertainties that hinder their predictive capabilities. Therefore, this research investigates the influence of the turbulent Prandtl number uncertainty, that governs the level of shear stress and heat flux present in the turbulent flow, on key output quantities of interest (QoIs). The US3D hypersonics solver is employed to simulate aeroheating over a hypersonic waverider configuration using the classical Menter Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model. A polynomial chaos expansion (PEC) framework is presented that enables a global sensitivity analysis and forward propagation of uncertainty for a range of turbulent prandtl number, generating statistics including skewness and kurtosis of the QoIs. In addition, Sobol indices are calculated to quantify the relative contribution of the turbulent prandtl number to the overall uncertainty in the heat flux and surface pressure outputs. The results provide valuable insights into the underlying aeroheating behavior in RANS simulations under hypersonic non-equilibrium flow conditions over a waverider previously studied at the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) facility. These findings will inform future design processes and improve the reliability of RANS-based predictions in hypersonic applications.</description>

      <title>A new dynamic slip approach for wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulations in a Consistent Discontinuous Galerkin Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wall-modeled large eddy simulation approach is proposed in a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) setting, building on the slip-wall concept of Bae et al. (JFM'19) and the universal scaling relationship by Pradhan and Duraisamy (JFM'23). The effect of the order of the DG approximation is introduced via the length scales in the formulation. The level of under-resolution is represented by a slip Reynolds number and the model attempts to also incorporate the effects of the numerical discretization and the subgrid-scale model. The dynamic part of the new model is based on a modified form of Germano identity -- performed on the universal scaling parameter -- and is coupled with the dynamic Smagorinsky model. A sharp modal cut-off filter is used as the test filter for the dynamic procedure, and the dynamic model can be easily integrated into any DG solver. Numerical experiments on channel flows show that grid independence of the statistics is achievable and predictions for the mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles agree well with the DNS, even with significant under-resolution. When applied to flows with separation and reattachment, the model also consistently predicts one-point statistics in the reverse flow and post-reattachment regions in good agreement with experiments. The performance of the model in accurately predicting equilibrium and separated flows using significantly under-resolved meshes can be attributed to several aspects that work synergistically: the optimal finite-element projection framework; the interplay of the scale-separation and numerical discretization within the DG framework; and the consistent dynamic procedures for subgrid and wall modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering design and scientific analysis rely upon computer simulations of turbulent fluid flows using turbulence models. These turbulence models are empirical and approximate, leading to large uncertainties in their predictions that hamper scientific and engineering advances. We outline a Physics Constrained Deep Learning framework to estimate turbulence model uncertainties using physics based Eigenspace Perturbations along with Deep Learning based guidance. The Deep Learning based modulation controls the spatial variation in perturbation magnitude to improve the calibration of uncertainty estimates over the state of the art physics based methods.</description>

      <title>Odd viscous flow past a sphere at low but nonzero Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring lift force on symmetrically shaped obstacles immersed in laminar flow is the quintessential way of signalling odd viscosity. For flow past cylinders, such a lift force does not arise when incompressibility and no-slip boundary conditions hold, whereas for spheres, a lift force was found in Stokes flow, applying to cases where the Reynolds number is negligible and convection can be ignored. When considering the role of convection at low but nonzero Reynolds numbers, two arising hurdles are the Whitehead paradox and the breaking of axial symmetry, which are overcome by asymptotic matching and the Lorentz reciprocal theorem respectively. We also consider the case where axial symmetry is retained because the translation of the sphere is aligned with the anisotropy vector of odd viscosity. We find that while lift vanishes, the interplay between odd viscosity and convection gives rise to a stream-induced non-vanishing torque.</description>

      <title>Free energy formulas for confined nematic liquid crystals based on analogies with Kirchhoff-Routh theory in vortex dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active nematics are influenced by alignment angle singularities called topological defects. The localization of these defects is of major interest for biological applications. The total distortion of alignment angles due to defects is evaluated using Frank free energy, which is one of the criteria used to determine the location and stability of these defects. Previous work used the line integrals of a complex potential associated with the alignments for the energy calculation (Miyazako and Nara, R. Soc. Open Sci., 2022), which has a high computational cost. We propose analytical formulas for the free energy in the presence of multiple topological defects in confined geometries. The formulas derived here are an analogue of Kirchhoff-Routh functions in vortex dynamics. The proposed formulas are explicit with respect to the defect locations and conformal maps, which enables the explicit calculation of the energy extrema. The formulas are applied to calculate the locations of defects in so-called doublets and triplets by solving simple polynomial formulas. A stability analysis is also conducted to detect whether defect pairs with charges $\pm 1/2$ are stable or unstable in triplet regions. Our numerical results are shown to match the experimental results (Ienaga {\em et al.,} Soft Matter, 2023).</description>

      <title>A general model for spin coating on a non-axisymmetric curved substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a generalised asymptotic model for the flow of a thin fluid film over an arbitrarily-parameterised non-axisymmetric curved substrate surface based on the lubrication approximation. In addition to surface tension, gravity, and centrifugal force, our model incorporates the effects of the Coriolis force and disjoining pressure, together with a non-uniform initial condition, which have not been widely considered in existing literature. We use this model to investigate the impact of the Coriolis force and fingering instability on the spreading of a non-axisymmetric spin-coated film at a range of substrate angular velocities, first on a flat substrate, and then on parabolic cylinder- and saddle-shaped curved substrates. We show that, on flat substrates, the Coriolis force has a negligible impact at low angular velocities, and at high angular velocities results in a small deflection of fingers formed at the contact line against the direction of substrate rotation. On curved substrates, we demonstrate that as the angular velocity is increased, spin coated films transition from being dominated by gravitational drainage with no fingering to spreading and fingering in the direction with the greatest component of centrifugal force tangent to the substrate surface. For both curved substrates and all angular velocities considered, we show that the film thickness and total wetted substrate area remain similar over time to those on a flat substrate, with the key difference being the shape of the spreading droplet.</description>

      <title>Drag, lift, and torque correlations for axi-symmetric rod-like non-spherical particles in linear wall-bounded shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents novel correlations to predict the drag, lift, and torque coefficients of axi-symmetric non-spherical rod-like particles in a wall-bounded linear shear flow. The particle position and orientation relative to the wall are varied to systematically investigate the influence of the wall on the hydrodynamic forces. The newly derived correlations for drag, lift, and torque on the particle depend on various parameters, including the particle Reynolds number, the orientation angle between the major axis of the particle and the main local flow direction, the aspect ratio of the particle, and the dimensionless distance from the particle centre to the wall. The coefficients of the correlations are determined through a fitting process utilizing the data generated from our previous study on the interaction forces between a locally uniform flow and an axi-symmetric non-spherical rod-like particles, as well as from data of novel direct numerical simulations (DNS) performed in this work of flow past axi-symmetric rod-like particles near a wall. The proposed correlations exhibit a good agreement compared to the DNS results, with median errors of 2.89%, 5.37%, and 11.00%, and correlation coefficients of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.96 for the correlations accounting for changes in drag, lift, and torque coefficients due to the wall-bounded linear shear flow profile, respectively. These correlations can be used in large-scale simulations using an Eulerian-Lagrangian or a CFD/DEM framework to predict the behaviour of axi-symmetric rod-like non-spherical particles in wall-bounded flows, shear flows, as well as uniform flows.</description>

      <title>How "mixing" affects propagation and structure of intensely turbulent, lean, hydrogen-air premixed flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsically fast hydrogen-air premixed flames propagate much faster in turbulence. Understanding why and to what extent flame displacement speeds of lean hydrogen-air flames are affected by turbulence is crucial for systematically developing hydrogen-based gas turbines and spark ignition engines. This paper presents fundamental insights on the variation of flame displacement speeds by investigating how disrupted flame structure affects speed and vice-versa. To that end, we investigate three DNS cases of lean hydrogen-air mixtures with effective Lewis numbers ($Le$) from 0.5 to 1, over Karlovitz number ($Ka$) from 100 to 1000. Suitable comparisons are made with the closest canonical laminar flame configurations at identical mixture conditions and their appropriateness and limitations in expounding turbulent flame properties are elucidated. Since near-zero curvature surface locations are most probable and representative of the average flame structure in such large $Ka$ flames, statistical variation of the flame displacement speed and concomitant change in flame structure at those locations constitute the focus of this study. We find that lean hydrogen flames could be thinned or thickened with respect to their standard laminar counterpart but always thickened on average compared to the corresponding strained laminar flames at equal average tangential strain-rate conditions. While turbulent straining enhances the local flame displacement speed in most parts of the highly lean premixed flames through $Le$ effects, on average, the enhancement is different from those achieved in strained laminar flames due to local flame thickening. This thickening is primarily due to reversal in the direction of the flame speed gradient underpinned by ubiquitous, non-local, cylindrical flame-flame interaction events resulting in localized scalar mixing within the flame structure in these large $Ka$ flames.</description>

      <title>Flow control of three-dimensional cylinders transitioning to turbulence via multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing active-flow-control (AFC) strategies for three-dimensional (3D) bluff bodies is a challenging task with critical industrial implications. In this study we explore the potential of discovering novel control strategies for drag reduction using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a high-dimensional AFC setup on a 3D cylinder, considering Reynolds numbers ($Re_D$) from $100$ to $400$, which is a range including the transition to 3D wake instabilities. The setup involves multiple zero-net-mass-flux jets positioned on the top and bottom surfaces, aligned into two slots. The method relies on coupling the computational-fluid-dynamics solver with a multi-agent reinforcement-learning (MARL) framework based on the proximal-policy-optimization algorithm. MARL offers several advantages: it exploits local invariance, adaptable control across geometries, facilitates transfer learning and cross-application of agents, and results in a significant training speedup. For instance, our results demonstrate $21\%$ drag reduction for $Re_D=300$, outperforming classical periodic control, which yields up to $6\%$ reduction. To the authors' knowledge, the present MARL-based framework represents the first time where training is conducted in 3D cylinders. This breakthrough paves the way for conducting AFC on progressively more complex turbulent-flow configurations.</description>

      <title>On The Implicit Large Eddy Simulation of Turbomachinery Flows Using The Flux Reconstruction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high order flux reconstruction solver has been developed and validated to perform implicit large eddy simulations of industrially representative turbomachinery flows. The T106c low-pressure turbine and VKI LS89 high-pressure turbine cases are studied. The solver uses the Rusanov Riemann solver to compute the inviscid fluxes on the wall boundaries, and HLLC or Roe to evaluate inviscid fluxes for internal faces. The impact of Riemann solvers is demonstrated in terms of accuracy and non-linear stability for turbomachinery flows. It is found that HLLC is more robust than Roe, but both Riemann solvers produce very similar results if stable solutions can be obtained. For non-linear stabilization, a local modal filter, which combines a smooth indicator and a modal filter, is used to stabilize the solution. This approach requires a tuning parameter for the smoothness criterion. Detailed analysis has been provided to guide the selection of a suitable value for different spatial orders of accuracy. This local-modal filter is also compared with the recent positivity-preserving entropy filter in terms of accuracy and stability for the LS89 turbine case. The entropy filter could stabilize the computation but is more dissipative than the local modal filter. Regarding the spanwise spacing of the grid, the case of the LS89 turbine shows that a $z^+$ of approximately $45 - 60$ is suitable for obtaining a satisfactory prediction of the heat transfer coefficient of the mean flow. This would allow for a coarse grid spacing in the spanwise direction and a cost-effective ILES aerothermal simulation for turbomachinery flows.</description>

      <title>Shape of a droplet on a surface in the presence of an external field and its critical disruption condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the potential application of regulating droplet shape by external fields in microfluidic technology and micro devices, it becomes increasingly important to understand the shape formation of a droplet in the presence of an electric field. How to understand and determine such a deformable boundary shape at equilibrium has been a long-term physical and mathematical challenge. Here, based on the theoretical model we propose, and combining the finite element method and the gradient descent algorithm, we successfully obtain the droplet shape by considering the contributions made by electrostatic energy, surface tension energy, and gravitational potential energy. We also carry out scaling analyses and obtain an empirical critical disruption condition with a universal scaling exponent 1/2 for the contact angle in terms of normalized volume. The master curve fits both the experimental and the numerical results very well.</description>

      <title>Magnetized compressible turbulence with a fluctuation dynamo and Reynolds numbers over a million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a ubiquitous state for many astrophysical plasmas. However, even the basic statistics for this type of turbulence remains uncertain. We present results from supersonic MHD turbulence simulations at unparalleled resolutions, with plasma Reynolds numbers of over a million. In the kinetic energy spectrum we find a break between the scales that are dominated by kinetic energy, with spectral index $-2$, and those that become strongly magnetized, with spectral index $-3/2$. By analyzing the Helmholtz decomposed kinetic energy spectrum, we find that the compressible modes are not passively mixed through the cascade of the incompressible modes. At high magnetic Reynolds number, above $10^5$, we find a power law in the magnetic energy spectrum with spectral index $-9/5$. On the strongly magnetized, subsonic scales the plasma tends to self-organize into locally relaxed regions, where there is strong alignment between the current density, magnetic field, velocity field and vorticity field, depleting both the nonlinearities and magnetic terms in the MHD equations, which we attribute to plasma relaxation on scales where the magnetic fluctuations evolve on shorter timescales than the velocity fluctuations. This process constrains the cascade to inhomogenous, volume-poor, fractal surfaces between relaxed regions, which has significant repercussions for understanding the nature of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas and the saturation of the fluctuation dynamo.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Refiner: Fine-Tuning of Accurate Spatiotemporal Neural Operator for Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.</description>

      <title>Emergent asymmetry in confined bioconvection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bioconvection is the prototypical active matter system for hydrodynamic instabilities and pattern formation in suspensions of biased swimming microorganisms, particularly at the dilute end of the concentration spectrum where cell-cell interactions typically are neglected. Confinement is an inherent characteristic of such systems, including those that are naturally-occurring or industrially-exploited, so it is important to understand the impact of boundaries on the hydrodynamic instabilities. Despite recent interest in this area we note that commonly-adopted symmetry assumptions in the literature, such as for a vertical channel or pipe, are uncorroborated and potentially unjustified. Therefore, by employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we investigate whether confinement itself can drive asymmetric plume formation in a suspension of bottom-heavy swimming microorganisms (gyrotactic cells). For a class of solutions in a vertical channel we establish the existence of a first integral of motion, and reveal that asymptotic asymmetry is plausible. Furthermore, numerical simulations from both Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives demonstrate with remarkable agreement that asymmetric solutions can indeed be more stable than symmetric; asymmetric solutions are in fact dominant for a large, practically-important region of parameter space. In addition, we verify the presence of blip and varicose instabilities for an experimentally accessible parameter range. Finally, we extend our study to a vertical Hele-Shaw geometry to explore whether a simple linear drag approximation can be justified. We find that although two-dimensional bioconvective structures and associated bulk properties have some similarities with experimental observations, approximating near wall physics in even the simplest confined systems remains challenging.</description>

Abstract: Simulation is a powerful tool to better understand physical systems, but generally requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Downstream applications of such simulations can become computationally infeasible if they require many forward solves, for example in the case of inverse design with many degrees of freedom. In this work, we investigate and extend neural PDE solvers as a tool to aid in scaling simulations for two-phase flow problems, and simulations of oil expulsion from a pore specifically. We extend existing numerical methods for this problem to a more complex setting involving varying geometries of the domain to generate a challenging dataset. Further, we investigate three prominent neural PDE solver methods, namely the UNet, DRN and U-FNO, and extend them for characteristics of the oil-expulsion problem: (1) spatial conditioning on the geometry; (2) periodicity in the boundary; (3) approximate mass conservation. We scale all methods and benchmark their speed-accuracy trade-off, evaluate qualitative properties, and perform an ablation study. We find that the investigated methods can accurately model the droplet dynamics with up to three orders of magnitude speed-up, that our extensions improve performance over the baselines, and that the introduced varying geometries constitute a significantly more challenging setting over the previously considered oil expulsion problem.</description>

      <title>Modulating Leidenfrost-like Prompt Jumping of Sessile Droplets on Microstructured Surfaces NPformat</title>

Abstract: The Leidenfrost effect, namely the levitation and hovering of liquid drops on hot solid surfaces, generally requires a sufficiently high substrate temperature to activate the intense liquid vaporization. Here we report the agile modulations of Leidenfrost-like prompt jumping of sessile water microdroplets on micropillared surfaces at a remarkably mitigated temperature. Compared to traditional Leidenfrost effect occurring above 230 {\deg}C, the fin-array-like micropillars enables Wenzel-state water microdroplets to levitate and jump off within 1.33 ms at an unprecedently low temperature of 130 {\deg}C by triggering the inertia-controlled growth of individual vapor bubbles at the droplet base. We demonstrate that droplet jumping, resulting from the momentum interactions between the expanding vapor bubble and the droplet, can be deftly modulated by simply tailoring the thermal boundary layer thickness via pillar heights, which acts to regulate the bubble expansion between the inertia-controlled mode and the heat-transfer-limited mode. Intriguingly, the two bubble growth modes give rise to distinct droplet jumping behaviors characterized by constant velocity and constant energy schemes, respectively. This strategy allows the facile purging of wetting liquid drops on rough or structured surfaces in a controlled manner, inspiring promising applications in rapid removal of fouling even settled in surface cavities.</description>

      <title>Direct Statistical Simulation using generalised cumulant expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the Generalised Quasilinear (GQL) approximation has been developed and its efficacy tested against purely quasilinear (QL) approximations. GQL systematically interpolates between QL and fully non-linear dynamics by employing a generalised Reynolds decomposition. Here, we examine an exact statistical closure for the GQL equations on the doubly periodic $\beta$-plane. Closure is achieved at second order using a generalised cumulant approach which we term GCE2. GCE2 is shown to yield improved performance over statistical representations of purely QL dynamics (CE2) and thus enables Direct Statistical Simulation (DSS) of complex mean flows that do not entirely fall within the remit of pure QL theory. Despite the existence of an exact closure, GCE2 like CE2 admits the possibility of a rank instability that leads to differences with statistics obtained from GQL. Recognition of this instability is a necessary step before further progress can be made with the GCE2 statistical closure.</description>

      <title>A general pressure equation based method for incompressible two-phase flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fully-explicit, iteration-free, weakly-compressible method to simulate immiscible incompressible two-phase flows. To update pressure, we circumvent the computationally expensive Poisson equation and use the general pressure equation. In addition, the volume-of-fluid approach is used for interface capturing under the operator-split methodology. Our method is fully-explicit and stable with simple local spatial discretization, and hence, it is easy to implement. Several two- and three-dimensional canonical two-phase flows are simulated. The qualitative and quantitative results prove that our method is capable of accurately handling problems involving a range of density and viscosity ratios and surface tension effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pseudo-spectal Navier-Stokes solver for plane parallel flows (Couette/Poiseuille), that has been developed on the MATLAB programming language. The code performs direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of turbulence in 3 dimensions at low Reynolds numbers ($Re_{\tau} \approx 40-180 $), using a programming structure that mainly employs matrix multiplications to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. The novelty of this DNS code lies on the vectorization of the required operations to simultaneously advance in time an ensemble of flow realizations and the utilization of graphics processing unit (GPU) computational resources, which offers a significant reduction of running time for simulations with adequately resolved viscous scales.</description>

      <title>Jet mixing enhancement with Bayesian optimization, deep learning, and persistent data topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We optimize the jet mixing using large eddy simulations (LES) at a Reynolds number of $3000$. Key methodological enablers consist of Bayesian optimization, a surrogate model enhanced by deep learning, and persistent data topology for physical interpretation. The mixing performance is characterized by an equivalent jet radius ($R_{\rm eq}$) derived from the streamwise velocity in a plane located $8$ diameters downstream. The optimization is performed in a 22-dimensional actuation space that comprises most known excitations. The plant benefits from a 22-dimensional actuation space that comprises most known excitations. This search space parameterizes distributed actuation imposed on the bulk flow and at the periphery of the nozzle in the streamwise and radial directions. The momentum flux measures the energy input of the actuation. The optimization quadruples the jet radius $R_{\rm eq}$ with a $7$-armed blooming jet after around $570$ evaluations. The control input requires $2\%$ momentum flux of the main flow, which is one order of magnitude lower than an ad hoc dual-mode excitation. Intriguingly, a pronounced suboptimum in the search space is associated with a double-helix jet, a new flow pattern. This jet pattern results in a mixing improvement comparable to the blooming jet. A state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization converges towards this double helix solution. The learning is accelerated and converges to another better optimum by including surrogate model trained along the optimization. Persistent data topology extracts the global and many local minima in the actuation space. These minima can be identified with flow patterns beneficial to the mixing.</description>

      <title>Resolution and convergence requirements for extended overlap region in wall-bounded turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations (DNSs) are one of the most powerful tools for studying turbulent flows. Even if the Reynolds numbers achievable with DNS are lower than those obtained with experimental means, there is a clear advantage since the entire velocity field is known, and any desired quantity can be evaluated. This also includes computation of derivatives of all relevant terms. One such derivative provides the indicator function, which may depend on mesh spacing and distribution, and the convergence of computation. The indicator function is a cornerstone to understanding inner and outer interactions in wall-bounded flows, and the description of the overlap region between them. We find dependence of the indicator function on the mesh distributions we examined, raising questions about the classical mesh and convergence requirements for DNS.</description>

      <title>Reynolds number effect on drag reduction in pipe flows by a transverse wall oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of turbulent pipe flow with transverse wall oscillation (WWO) and with no transverse wall oscillation (NWO) are carried out at friction Reynolds numbers Re{\tau} = 170, 360, and 720. The period and amplitude of the oscillation are selected to achieve high drag reduction in this Reynolds number range, and the effect of increasing Reynolds number on the amount of drag reduction achievable is analyzed. Of a particular interest in this study is the identification of the scales of motion most affected by drag reduction at different Reynolds numbers. To answer this question, both one-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra of different statistical quantities are analyzed with and without transverse wall oscillation. The effect of wall oscillation is found to suppress the intermediate- and large-scale motions in the buffer layer of the flow, while large-scale and very-large-scale motions in the log layer and the wake region are enhanced. While suppression of the near-wall turbulence promotes drag reduction, enhancement of the large-scale motions in the log and the wake region is found to oppose drag reduction. Since higher Reynolds number flows support development of a growing range of large-scale structures, it is suggested that their prevalence in the energy spectra combined with their negative effect on drag reduction account for a reduced effectiveness of wall oscillation as a drag reduction mechanism with increasing Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>On the early stages of vapor bubble growth: From the surface-tension to the inertial regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new analytical model for the early stages of vapor bubble growth in superheated liquids. The model bridges a gap in current knowledge by focusing on the surface tension-controlled, near-equilibrium growth regime and its transition to an inertia-controlled regime. A unified analytical model is derived by combining a perturbation method for the initial growth regime with a complementary outer solution to model the subsequent bubble growth rate. The model successfully predicts the initial delay in bubble growth due to surface tension effects. Two non-dimensional parameters govern this delay period: the initial perturbation from the equilibrium radius and the Ohnesorge number at the onset of nucleation. The Ohnesorge number encapsulates the interplay between viscous damping and surface tension forces acting on the bubble during its early growth stages. The analytical solutions presented here allow for quantifying the surface-tension, inertial, and transitional regimes while establishing a simple criterion for estimating the influence of thermal effects on early-stage growth. Our findings emphasize the significance of considering the surface tension delay, particularly for short timescales. The derived analytical solutions and the obtained correlation for surface-tension-induced delay may prove a practical tool and could be integrated into existing models of vapor bubble growth.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulations of microlayer formation during heterogeneous bubble nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present direct numerical simulation results for the expansion of spherical cap bubbles attached to a rigid wall due to a sudden drop in the ambient pressure. The critical pressure drop beyond which the bubble growth becomes unstable is found to match well with the predictions from classical theory of heterogeneous nucleation imposing a quasi-static bubble evolution. When the pressure drop is significantly higher than the critical value, a liquid microlayer appears between the bubble and the wall. In this regime, the interface outside the microlayer grows at an asymptotic velocity that can be predicted from the Rayleigh--Plesset equation, while the contact line evolves with another asymptotic velocity that scales with a visco-capillary velocity that obeys the Cox--Voinov law. In general, three distinctive regions can be distinguished: the region very close to the contact line where dynamics is governed by visco-capillary effects, an intermediate region controlled by inertio-viscous effects away from the contact line yet inside the viscous boundary layer, and the region outside the boundary layer dominated by inertial effects. The microlayer forms in a regime where the capillary effects are confined in a region much smaller than the viscous boundary layer thickness. In this regime, the global capillary number takes values much larger then the critical capillary number for bubble nucleation, and the microlayer height is controlled by viscous effects and not surface tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a theoretical framework for predicting friction and heat transfer coefficients in variable-properties forced air convection. Drawing from concepts in high-speed wall turbulence, which also involves significant temperature, viscosity, and density variations, we utilize the mean momentum balance and mean thermal balance equations to develop integral transformations that account for the impact of variable fluid properties. These transformations are then applied inversely to predict the friction and heat transfer coefficients, leveraging the universality of passive scalars transport theory. Our proposed approach is validated using a comprehensive dataset from direct numerical simulations, covering both heating and cooling conditions up to a friction Reynolds number of approximately $\Rey_\tau\approx 3200$. The predicted friction and heat transfer coefficients closely match DNS data with an accuracy margin of 1-2\%, representing a significant improvement over the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>An analysis and solution of ill-conditioning in physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a novel and popular approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, achieving stable training and obtaining correct results remain a challenge in many cases, often attributed to the ill-conditioning of PINNs. Nonetheless, further analysis is still lacking, severely limiting the progress and applications of PINNs in complex engineering problems. Drawing inspiration from the ill-conditioning analysis in traditional numerical methods, we establish a connection between the ill-conditioning of PINNs and the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian matrix of the PDE system. Specifically, for any given PDE system, we construct its controlled system. This controlled system allows for adjustment of the condition number of the Jacobian matrix while retaining the same solution as the original system. Our numerical findings suggest that the ill-conditioning observed in PINNs predominantly stems from the Jacobian matrix. As the condition number of the Jacobian matrix decreases, PINNs exhibit faster convergence rates and higher accuracy. Building upon this understanding and the natural extension of controlled systems, we present a general approach to mitigate the ill-conditioning of PINNs, leading to successful simulations of the three-dimensional flow around the M6 wing at a Reynolds number of 5,000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PINNs have been successful in simulating such complex systems, offering a promising new technique for addressing industrial complexity problems. Our findings also offer valuable insights guiding the future development of PINNs.</description>

      <title>Interpretable data-driven turbulence modeling for separated flows using symbolic regression with unit constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have been applied to enhance turbulence modeling in recent years. However, the "black box" nature of most machine learning techniques poses significant interpretability challenges in improving turbulence models. This paper introduces a novel unit-constrained turbulence modeling framework using symbolic regression to overcome these challenges. The framework amends the constitutive equation of linear eddy viscosity models (LEVMs) by establishing explicit equations between the Reynolds stress deviation and mean flow quantities, thereby improving the LEVM model's predictive capability for large separated turbulence. Unit consistency constraints are applied to the symbolic expressions to ensure physical realizability. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to the separated flow over 2D periodic hills. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy and generalization capabilities of the learned turbulence model. Compared to the standard k-{\epsilon} model, the learned model exhibits significantly enhanced predictive accuracy for anisotropic Reynolds stresses and flow velocities. It also more accurately identifies flow separations and exhibits promising generalization capabilities across different flow geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear shear flow bounded by a plane wall is an idealization that occurs in microfluidic devices and many other applications. Perfect plane approximation neglects surface irregularities and discrete particles adsorbed at the surface. Here we study the disturbance to the linear shear flow due to the particle(s) rigidly attached to the surface. We first revisit the exact solution of O'Neill for a spherical particle in contact with an infinite plane boundary. While the original paper contains multiple typos and provides very few details of the derivation, we present detailed solution accompanied by an alternative and simpler derivation of the viscous force and the torque exerted on the particle. We further study the universal far-field behavior of the flow due to an arbitrary particle adhered to the surface, and demonstrate that it is controlled by the stress moment of magnitude depending on particle's volume and shape. Using the revised O'Neill solution, we compute the stress moment for a spherical particle. Using the far-field asymptotic form of the flow we estimate the net flow due to uniform and sparse layer of discrete adsorbates by superposition and demonstrate that it does not decay away from the plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Odd viscosity (OV) is a transport coefficient in, for example, fluids of self-spinning (active) particles or electrons in an external magnetic field. The key feature of OV is that it does not contribute to dissipation in two spatial dimensions. In contrast, we explicitly show that in the three-dimensional case, OV can contribute indirectly to dissipation by modifying the fluid flow. We quantify the dissipation rate of a single spherical particle moving through a fluid with OV via an exact analytical solution of the generalised stationary creeping flow equations. Our results provide a novel way to quantify the effects of OV by measuring the solid-body motion of a single spherical particle. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate how complex fluids can be designed in terms of their rheological properties by mixing passive particles with self-spinning active particles.</description>
