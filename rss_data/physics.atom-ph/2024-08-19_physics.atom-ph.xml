      <title>Laser-cooling Cadmium Bosons and Fermions with Near Ultraviolet Triplet Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cadmium is laser-cooled and trapped with excitations to triplet states with UVA light, first using only the $67\,$kHz wide $326\,$nm intercombination line and subsequently, for large loading rates, the $25\,$MHz wide $361\,$nm $\,^3P_2$$\,\rightarrow\,$$\,^3D_3$ transition. Eschewing the hard UV $229\,$nm $^1S_0$$\,\rightarrow$$\,^1P_1$ transition, only small magnetic fields gradients, less than $6\,$G$\,$cm$^{-1}$, are required enabling a 100\% transfer of atoms from the $361\,$nm trap to the $326\,$nm narrow-line trap. All 8 stable cadmium isotopes are straightforwardly trapped, including two nuclear-spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions that require no additional repumping. We observe evidence of $^3P_2$ collisions limiting the number of trapped metastable atoms, report isotope shifts for $^{111}$Cd and $^{113}$Cd of the $326\,$nm $^1S_0$$\,\rightarrow$$\,^3P_1$, $480\,$nm $^3P_1$$\,\rightarrow$$\,^3S_1$, and $361\,$nm $^3P_2$$\,\rightarrow$$\,^3D_3$ transitions, and measure the $^{114}$Cd 5s5p$\,^3P_2$$\,\rightarrow\,$5s5d$\,^3D_3$ transition frequency to be $830\,096\,573(15)\,$MHz.</description>

      <title>Acceleration and twisting of neutral atoms by strong elliptically polarized short-wavelength laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated non-dipole effects in the interaction of a hydrogen atom with elliptically polarized laser pulses of intensity 10$^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ with about 8 fs duration. The study was performed within the framework of a hybrid quantum-quasiclassical approach in which the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for an electron and the classical Hamilton equations for the center-of-mass (CM) of an atom are simultaneously integrated. It is shown that the spatial inhomogeneity $ \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}$ of the laser field and the presence of a magnetic component in it lead to the non-separability of the CM and electron variables in a neutral atom and, as a consequence, to its acceleration. We have established a strict correlation between the total probability of excitation and ionization of an atom and the velocity of its CM acquired as a result of interaction with a laser pulse. The acceleration of the atom weakly depends on the polarization of the laser in the considered region (\mbox{5 eV $\lesssim \hbar\omega \lesssim $ 27 eV}) of its frequencies. However, the transition from linear to elliptical laser polarization leads to the twisting of the atom relative to the axis directed along the pulse propagation (coinciding with the direction of the momentum of the accelerated atom). It is shown that with increasing ellipticity the twisting effect increases and reaches its maximum value with circular polarization. At this point the projection of the orbital angular momentum acquired by the electron onto the direction of the pulse propagation reaches its maximum value. Further exploration of the possibilities for producing accelerated and twisted atoms with electromagnetic pulses is of interest for a number of prospective applications.</description>

      <title>Sputtering of targets in high-intensity heavy-ion beam experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on available models and experimental data, the sputtering of target atoms in long-term experiments with intense heavy ion (HI) beams has been considered. The experiments on the synthesis of superheavy nuclei (SHN), which are carried out in laboratories around the world, are examples of such experiments encountering the target atoms sputtering in specific conditions. Rotating wheels with a relatively large target annulus area are used in these experiments to reduce the temperature and radiation loads on the target. Large areas of rotating targets allow one to reduce the sputtering yields of target atoms significantly. The question arises about the reliability of these yields in experiments on the synthesis of SHN with Z &gt; 118. These nuclei can be produced with extremely low cross sections, requiring HI beam doses exceeding 1020 particles passed through the target to observe several decay events of the thus synthesized SHN. Estimates based on approximations and simulations considered in this work are presented and compared with some data on actinide target sputtering obtained in experiments performed on the synthesis of SHN.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy Nuclear Spin Dependent Parity Violating Amplitudes in $^{133}$Cs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory at the singles and doubles approximation has been implemented to estimate nuclear spin dependent (NSD) parity violating (PV) electric dipole (E1) transition amplitudes ($E1_{PV}^{NSD}$) among hyperfine levels of the $6s ~^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7s ~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in $^{133}$Cs. To validate our calculations, we reproduce the Dirac-Hartree-Fock values and results from the combined coupled-Dirac-Hartree-Fock and random phase approximation (CPDF-RPA) method reported earlier. Contributions from the double-core-polarization (DCP) effects at the CPDF-RPA method were found to be between 3-12\% among different hyperfine levels. We derived a generalized expression for $E1_{PV}^{NSD}$, which helped incorporate both the NSD PV Hamiltonian and E1 operator simultaneously in the perturbative approach to account for the DCP contributions. The RCC method subsumes the CPDF-RPA and DCP effects in addition to contributions from the Br\"uckner pair-correlations and normalization of the wave functions, and correlations among them. To improve accuracy of the $E1_{PV}^{NSD}$ amplitudes further, we replace the {\it ab initio} values of the E1 matrix elements and energies by their experimental values via a sum-over-states approach.</description>

      <title>Proposal for simulating quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using Rydberg atoms, and construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a method to simulate quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) using Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our approach involves a two-photon Raman transition and a transformation to the spin-rotating frame, both of which are feasible with current experimental techniques. As a model that can be simulated in our setup but not in solid-state systems, we consider an $S=1/2$ spin chain with a Hamiltonian consisting of the DMI and Zeeman energy. We study the magnetization curve in the ground state of this model and quench dynamics. Further, we show the existence of quantum many-body scar states and asymptotic quantum many-body scar states. The observed nonergodicity in this model demonstrates the importance of the highly tunable DMI that can be realized by the proposed quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Robust double Bragg diffraction via detuning control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new theoretical model and numerical optimization of double Bragg diffraction (DBD), a widely used technique in atom interferometry. We derive an effective two-level-system Hamiltonian based on the Magnus expansion in the so-called "quasi-Bragg regime", where most Bragg-pulse atom interferometers operate. Furthermore, we extend the theory to a five-level description to account for Doppler detuning. Using these derived effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the impacts of AC-Stark shift and polarization errors on the double Bragg beam-splitter, along with their mitigations through detuning control. Notably, we design a linear detuning sweep that demonstrates robust efficiency exceeding 99.5% against polarization errors up to 8.5%. Moreover, we develop an artificial intelligence-aided optimal detuning control protocol, showcasing enhanced robustness against both polarization errors and Doppler effects. This protocol achieves an average efficiency of 99.92% for samples with a finite momentum width of 0.05$\hbar k_L$ within an extended polarization error range of up to 10%.</description>
