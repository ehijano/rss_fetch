      <title>VEL: A Formally Verified Reasoner for OWL2 EL Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) has been instrumental in advancing the development of ontologies and knowledge graphs, providing a structured framework that enhances the semantic integration of data. However, the reliability of deductive reasoning within these systems remains challenging, as evidenced by inconsistencies among popular reasoners in recent competitions. This evidence underscores the limitations of current testing-based methodologies, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we have developed VEL, a formally verified EL++ reasoner equipped with machine-checkable correctness proofs that ensure the validity of outputs across all possible inputs. This formalization, based on the algorithm of Baader et al., has been transformed into executable OCaml code using the Coq proof assistant's extraction capabilities. Our formalization revealed several errors in the original completeness proofs, which led to changes to the algorithm to ensure its completeness. Our work demonstrates the necessity of mechanization of reasoning algorithms to ensure their correctness at theoretical and implementation levels.</description>

      <title>Branch Sequentialization in Quantum Polytime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation leverages the use of quantumly-controlled conditionals in order to achieve computational advantage. However, since the different branches in the conditional may operate on the same qubits, a typical approach to compilation involves performing the branches sequentially, which can easily lead to an exponential blowup of the program complexity. We introduce and study a compilation technique for avoiding branch sequentialization in a language that is sound and complete for quantum polynomial time, improving on previously existing polynomialsize bounds and showing the existence of techniques that preserve the intuitive complexity of the program.</description>

      <title>CSSDH: An Ontology for Social Determinants of Health to Operational Continuity of Care Data Interoperability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of digital platforms has led to an increasing reliance on technology-driven, home-based healthcare solutions, enabling individuals to monitor their health and share information with healthcare professionals as needed. However, creating an efficient care plan management system requires more than just analyzing hospital summaries and Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Factors such as individual user needs and social determinants of health, including living conditions and the flow of healthcare information between different settings, must also be considered. Challenges in this complex healthcare network involve schema diversity (in EHRs, personal health records, etc.) and terminology diversity (e.g., ICD, SNOMED-CT) across ancillary healthcare operations. Establishing interoperability among various systems and applications is crucial, with the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) emphasizing the need for patient-centric access and control of healthcare data. In this paper, we propose an integrated ontological model, the Common Semantic Data Model for Social Determinants of Health (CSSDH), by combining ISO/DIS 13940:2024 ContSys with WHO Social Determinants of Health. CSSDH aims to achieve interoperability within the Continuity of Care Network.</description>

      <title>Goal-Driven Query Answering over First- and Second-Order Dependencies with Equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query answering over data with dependencies plays a central role in most applications of dependencies. The problem is commonly solved by using a suitable variant of the chase algorithm to compute a universal model of the dependencies and the data and thus explicate all knowledge implicit in the dependencies. After this preprocessing step, an arbitrary conjunctive query over the dependencies and the data can be answered by evaluating it the computed universal model. If, however, the query to be answered is fixed and known in advance, computing the universal model is often inefficient as many inferences made during this process can be irrelevant to a given query. In such cases, a goal-driven approach, which avoids drawing unnecessary inferences, promises to be more efficient and thus preferable in practice.
  In this paper we present what we believe to be the first technique for goal-driven query answering over first- and second-order dependencies with equality reasoning. Our technique transforms the input dependencies so that applying the chase to the output avoids many inferences that are irrelevant to the query. The transformation proceeds in several steps, which comprise the following three novel techniques. First, we present a variant of the singularisation technique by Marnette [60] that is applicable to second-order dependencies and that corrects an incompleteness of a related formulation by ten Cate et al. [74]. Second, we present a relevance analysis technique that can eliminate from the input dependencies that provably do not contribute to query answers. Third, we present a variant of the magic sets algorithm [19] that can handle second-order dependencies with equality reasoning. We also present the results of an extensive empirical evaluation, which show that goal-driven query answering can be orders of magnitude faster than computing the full universal model.</description>

      <title>Rewriting for Symmetric Monoidal Categories with Commutative (Co)Monoid Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String diagrams are pictorial representations for morphisms of symmetric monoidal categories. They constitute an intuitive and expressive graphical syntax, which has found application in a very diverse range of fields including concurrency theory, quantum computing, control theory, machine learning, linguistics, and digital circuits. Rewriting theory for string diagrams relies on a combinatorial interpretation as double-pushout rewriting of certain hypergraphs. As previously studied, there is a `tension' in this interpretation: in order to make it sound and complete, we either need to add structure on string diagrams (in particular, Frobenius algebra structure) or pose restrictions on double-pushout rewriting (resulting in 'convex' rewriting). From the string diagram viewpoint, imposing a full Frobenius structure may not always be natural or desirable in applications, which motivates our study of a weaker requirement: commutative monoid structure. In this work we characterise string diagram rewriting modulo commutative monoid equations, via a sound and complete interpretation in a suitable notion of double-pushout rewriting of hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>HyperLTL Satisfiability Is Highly Undecidable, HyperCTL$^*$ is Even Harder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal logics for the specification of information-flow properties are able to express relations between multiple executions of a system. The two most important such logics are HyperLTL and HyperCTL*, which generalise LTL and CTL* by trace quantification. It is known that this expressiveness comes at a price, i.e.\ satisfiability is undecidable for both logics. In this paper we settle the exact complexity of these problems, showing that both are in fact highly undecidable: we prove that HyperLTL satisfiability is $\Sigma_1^1$-complete and HyperCTL* satisfiability is $\Sigma_1^2$-complete. These are significant increases over the previously known lower bounds and the first upper bounds. To prove $\Sigma_1^2$-membership for HyperCTL*, we prove that every satisfiable HyperCTL* sentence has a model that is equinumerous to the continuum, the first upper bound of this kind. We also prove this bound to be tight. Furthermore, we prove that both countable and finitely-branching satisfiability for HyperCTL* are as hard as truth in second-order arithmetic, i.e.\ still highly undecidable. Finally, we show that the membership problem for every level of the HyperLTL quantifier alternation hierarchy is $\Pi_1^1$-complete.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Strategic Abilities in Stochastic Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning about strategic abilities is key to AI systems comprising multiple agents, which provide a unified framework for formalizing various problems in game theory, social choice theory, etc. In this work, we propose a probabilistic extension of the alternating-time $\mu$-calculus (AMC), named PAMC, for reasoning about the strategic abilities of agents in stochastic multi-agent systems. We show that PAMC subsumes two existing logics AMC and P$\mu$TL (a probabilistic extension of the modal $\mu$-calculus), but is incomparable with the probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic (PATL). We study the problems of model checking and satisfiability checking for PAMC. We first give a model checking algorithm by leveraging algorithms for solving normal-form games and AMC model checking. We establish that the model checking problem of PAMC remains in UP$\cap$co-UP, the same complexity class as the model checking problem for AMC and P$\mu$TL. We also provide a new reduction from the satisfiability problem of PAMC to solving parity games, by which we obtain an EXPTIME decision procedure, as well as the small model property which allows us to construct a model for each satisfiable PAMC formula. Satisfiability in PAMC has the same complexity as in the modal $\mu$-calculus, unlike PCTL and PATL whose satisfiability checking problems remain open. We have implemented both the model checking and satisfiability checking algorithms as open-source tools. Experimental results are reported, showcasing the practical applications and effectiveness of our approaches.</description>

      <title>On a fibrational construction for optics, lenses, and Dialectica categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16388v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>

      <title>Large language models as oracles for instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes and properties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multiple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Experimentally, our approach achieves a quality metric that is up to five times higher than the state-of-the-art, while reducing erroneous entities and relations by up to ten times. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The Denotational Semantics of SSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Static single assignment form, or SSA, has been the dominant compiler intermediate representation for decades. In this paper, we give a type theory for a variant of SSA, including its equational theory, which are strong enough to validate a variety of control and data flow transformations. We also give a categorical semantics for SSA, and show that the type theory is sound and complete with respect to the categorical axiomatization. We demonstrate the utility of our model by exhibiting a variety of concrete models satisfying our axioms, including in particular a model of TSO weak memory. The correctness of the syntactic metatheory, as well as the completeness proof has been mechanized in the Lean proof assistant.</description>
