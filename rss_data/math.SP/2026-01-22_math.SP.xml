      <title>Generic real Jordan canonical forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the generic real Jordan canonical forms for $n\times n$ matrices with real entries. More precisely, we prove that the set of $n\times n$ real matrices is the union of the closures of $\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1$ sets, which are called generic bundles, as they are particular "bundles". In general, a bundle is the set of $n\times n$ real matrices with the same real Jordan canonical form, up to the values of the eigenvalues, provided that the eigenvalues which are distinct in one matrix of the bundle remain distinct in any other matrix of the same bundle. The $k$th generic bundle, for $0\leq k\leq\lfloor n/2\rfloor$, contains the $n\times n$ real matrices having $k$ different pairs of non-real conjugate eigenvalues and $n-2k$ different real eigenvalues. We prove that each of the $\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1$ generic bundles is an open subset of the set of $n\times n$ real matrices. Some numerical experiments are carried out with large sets of random matrices of different sizes to confirm that all the generic bundles show up, and only these ones.</description>

      <title>Typical hyperbolic surfaces have an optimal spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first non-zero Laplace eigenvalue of a hyperbolic surface, or its spectral gap, measures how well-connected the surface is: surfaces with a large spectral gap are hard to cut in pieces, have a small diameter and fast mixing times. For large hyperbolic surfaces (of large area or large genus $g$, equivalently), we know that the spectral gap is asymptotically bounded above by $\frac 14$. The aim of these talks is to present joint work with Nalini Anantharaman, where we prove that most hyperbolic surfaces have a near-optimal spectral gap. That is to say, we prove that, for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the Weil--Petersson probability for a hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ to have a spectral gap greater than $\frac 14- \epsilon$ goes to one as $g$ goes to infinity. This statement is analogous to Alon's 1986 conjecture for regular graphs, proven by Friedman in 2003. I will present our approach, which shares many similarities with Friedman's work, and introduce new tools and ideas that we have developed in order to tackle this problem.</description>

      <title>Majorization between symplectic spectra of positive semidefinite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite matrix $A$ with symplectic kernel, there exists a real $2n \times 2n$ \emph{symplectic matrix} $M$ such that $M^TAM= D \oplus D$, where $D$ is an $n \times n$ non-negative diagonal matrix which is unique up to permutation of its diagonal entries.
  The diagonal entries of $D$ are called the \emph{symplectic eigenvalues} or symplectic spectrum of $A$.
  In this work, we investigate some majorization and weak supermajorization relations between the symplectic spectra of two positive semidefinite matrices.
  More explicitly, suppose $A$ and $B$ are $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite matrices with symplectic kernels.
  We show that if the symplectic spectrum of $A$ is majorized by the symplectic spectrum of $B$, then $A$ lies in the convex hull of the symplectic orbit of $B$.
  We also establish that only a weak converse of this statement holds; i.e., if $A$ lies in the convex hull of the symplectic orbit of $B$ then the symplectic spectrum of $A$ is \emph{weakly supermajorized} by the symplectic spectrum of $B$.
  Several consequences of our results are also presented.
  Our methods make use of well-known connections between the theory of majorization, doubly stochastic, doubly superstochastic, and symplectic matrices.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Spectral Stability for an Embedded Annulus under Coupled Curve Shortening and $2$D Ricci Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral stability of Dirichlet eigenvalues on an embedded annulus whose boundary evolves by curve shortening flow while the ambient surface evolves under the two dimensional Ricci flow using variational formulas, Rellich--type identities, and harmonic capacity methods, we relate eigenvalue variations to geometric deficit and modulus. We establish quantitative bounds comparing the spectrum of the evolving annulus with that of a flat cylinder of equal modulus. As a consequence, we obtain geometric stability and a spectral gap estimate controlled by the deficit functional.</description>

      <title>Sobolev multipliers and fractional Gaussian fields on Lipschitz boundaries with applications to deterministic and random acoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Applied Physics and Photonics studies of random resonators, we study in the stochastic part of this paper random acoustic operators in non-smooth bounded domains $G \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and introduce m-dissipative impedance boundary conditions containing fractional Gaussian fields (FGFs). The deterministic part of the paper constructs and studies the spaces of pointwise multipliers on Lipschitz continuous boundaries $\partial G$, as well as the spaces of Sobolev (distribution-type) multipliers on boundaries $\partial G$ of better regularity. These multipliers are used as generalized impedance coefficients $\zeta (x)$, $x \in \partial G$, in impedance boundary conditions accompanying the first order acoustic system. The main efforts are aimed on the m-dissipativity of associated acoustic operators and the discreteness of the related spectra under weakest possible assumptions on the regularity of $\zeta$. In order to connect the deterministic results with the randomization, we introduce FGFs on Lipschitz boundaries $\partial G$ and study their regularity. To this end, we prove that a rough Weyl-type asymptotics takes place for the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues on arbitrary compact boundary $\partial G$ of $C^{0,1}$-regularity.</description>

      <title>Proof of geometric Borg's Theorem in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Delta+V$ be the discrete Schr\"odinger operator, where $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and potential $V:\mathbb{Z}^d\to \mathbb{C}$ is $\Gamma$-periodic with $\Gamma=q_1\mathbb{Z}\oplus q_2 \mathbb{Z}\oplus\cdots\oplus q_d\mathbb{Z}$. In this study, we establish a comprehensive characterization of complex-valued $\Gamma$-periodic functions such that the Bloch variety of $\Delta+V$ contains a graph of an entire function, in particular, we show that there are exactly $q_1q_2\cdots q_d$ such functions (up to Floquet isospectrality and translation). Moreover, by applying this understanding to real-valued functions $V$, we prove that $V$ is constant if and only if the Bloch variety of $\Delta+V$ contains a graph of an entire function, which confirms the conjecture concerning the geometric version of Borg's theorem in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Boundary Delocalization and Spectral Packets for Dirichlet Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a boundary delocalization principle for high-frequency Dirichlet eigenfunctions on smooth strictly convex domains. The main result excludes persistent boundary concentration at the level of individual eigenmodes when compared to short spectral packets of sublinear length. Quantitatively, we compare boundary energies of single eigenfunctions to packet sums over frequency windows of size N_k = o(k), without asserting any asymptotic gain in magnitude. The main mode-to-packet estimate relies only on the Rellich identity. For the multi-mode bias exclusion we additionally use the boundary local Weyl law to obtain a packet zero-mean cancellation estimate. This mode-to-packet comparison is independent of eigenvalue monotonicity and is stable under eigenvalue crossings.</description>

      <title>On the number of spanning trees of bicirculant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bi-Cayley graph over a cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is called a bicirculant graph. Let
  $\Gamma=BC(\mathbb{Z}_n; R,T,S)$ be a bicirculant graph with $R=R^{-1}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $T=T^{-1}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$. In this paper, using Chebyshev polynomials, we obtain a closed formula
  for the number of spanning trees of bicirculant graph $\Gamma$, investigate some arithmetic properties of the number of spanning trees of $\Gamma$, and find its asymptotic behaviour as $n$ tends infinity. In addition,
  we show that $F(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\tau(\Gamma)x^n$ is a rational function with integer coefficients.</description>
