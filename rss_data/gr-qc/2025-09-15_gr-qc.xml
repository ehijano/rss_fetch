      <title>Observational Constraints on a Spinor Field Generalized Chaplygin Gas Model in a Spherically Symmetric FLRW Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the standard LambdaCDM model in describing the evolution of the universe, several unresolved issues remain, such as the true nature of dark energy, fine-tuning problems, and the persistent Hubble tension. Motivated by these shortcomings, we construct a spinor field-based Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model that unifies dark matter and dark energy within a spherically symmetric Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. This framework incorporates a nonlinear spinor field and considers an open universe geometry. We constrain the model parameters using the latest observational datasets, including Type Ia supernovae from the binned Pantheon compilation, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC) and SDSS, including baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques, we obtain best-fit values that indicate the spinor GCG model provides a competitive and viable alternative to the LambdaCDM, particularly in the late-time universe. Furthermore, the model predicts a lower present-day Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. The results highlight the rich phenomenology of spinor fields and their possible role in the dynamics of dark energy through spacetime interaction.</description>

      <title>Bianchi-I cosmology with scale dependent $G$ and $\Lambda$ in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study anisotropic Bianchi-I (BI) cosmology, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections into the Einstein equation through the scale-dependent Newton coupling and cosmological term, as determined by the flow equation of the effective action for gravity. For the cosmological term $\Lambda_0=0$, we derive the quantum-corrected power-series solution for a general equation-of-state parameter $w$ in the range $-1&lt;w\leq 1$ in the form of expansions in both inverse cosmic time and the anisotropy parameter. We give a general criterion, valid for any $\Lambda_0$, if the solution becomes isotropic in the late time, which indicates that the universe becomes isotropic for most cases of $-1&lt;w&lt;1$ except $w=1$. By numerical analysis, we show that quantum corrections lead to earlier isotropization compared to the classical case starting from an initially highly anisotropic state. In contrast, for $\Lambda_0 &gt;0$, we obtain the inverse power-series solution in the exponential of the cosmic time. We find that the universe always becomes isotropic in the late time, in accordance with the cosmic no hair theorem, and the quantum corrections make the isotropization faster. We also briefly summarize the Kasner solution and its generalization with quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi wormholes in a Friedmann universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solution to the Einstein equations describes the dynamics of a self-gravitating spherically symmetric dust cloud with an arbitrary density profile and any distribution of initial velocities, encoded in three arbitrary functions $f(R)$, $F(R)$, and $\tau_0(R)$, where $R$ is a radial coordinate in the comoving reference frame. A particular choice of these functions corresponds to a wormhole geometry with a throat defined as a sphere of minimum radius at a fixed time instant. In this paper we explore LTB wormholes and discuss their possible observable appearance studying in detail the effects of gravitational lensing by such objects. For this aim, we study photon motion in wormhole space-time inscribed in a closed Friedmann dustfilled universe and find the wormhole shadow as it could be seen by a distant observer. Since the LTB wormhole is a dynamic object, we analyze the dependence of its shadow size on the observation time and on the initial size of the wormhole region. We reveal that the angular size of the shadow exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the observation time. At early times, the shadow size decreases as photons with smaller angular momentum gradually reach the observer. At later times, the expansion of the Friedmann Universe becomes a dominant factor that leads to an increase in the shadow size.</description>

      <title>Plunge spectra as discriminators of black hole mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the prospect of using the plunge to identify potential black hole mimickers. We show that the plunge excites two generic spectral features. (i) At low frequencies, there is a comb of sharp resonances at the real parts of the mimicker quasi-normal modes. (ii) Above a threshold $M\omega_{\rm th}\!\approx\!0.39$ (for the dominant mode), the spectrum undergoes a qualitative break: with the black hole mimicker displaying significant deviations from the black hole. Though individual plunge SNRs in extreme mass ratio events are low and detecting them in a sea of noise is difficult, the coherent spectral features identified here may allow for enhancing the SNR by using multiple events.</description>

      <title>Transit dark energy cosmological models in generalized matter-geometry coupling theory using a non-linear form of $f(R,T,L_{m})$ function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the cosmological consequences of the model in the recently developed gravity theory [Haghani and Harko, \textit{Eur. Phys. J. C} \textbf{81} (2021) 615.] using a non-linear form of the $f(R,T,L_{m})$ function and the latest observational datasets. For flat Friedman-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime and $f(R,T,L_{m})= \alpha\,R+\beta\,RT+\gamma\,RL_{m}-\eta$ with $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\eta$ as coupling constants, we have solved the modified field equations to get the Hubble function $H(z)$ in terms of $H_{0}$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$, $\Omega_{\eta}$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$. To ensure that the model is consistent with the physically observed universe, we constrained the model parameters using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis on joint datasets of cosmic chronometer and Pantheon samples. Using these approximated model parameter values, we investigated the universe's cosmic evolution history, including the deceleration parameter, effective equation of state, dark energy equation of state, total dark energy density parameters, universe age, and so on. In addition, to assess the physical acceptability and stability of the generated model, we conducted the Om diagnostic test, causality test, and energy conditions test.</description>

      <title>The Doppler boosted LISA response to gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatory LISA is expected to detect massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), ranging up to thousands. Such high-precision observations require accurate modeling of the detector response. However, current derivations of the response function neglect the motion of the spacecraft during light travel time, omitting velocity-dependent terms of order $\beta = v/c \sim 10^{-4}$. In this work, we derive the velocity-dependent corrections to the gravitational wave response. We analyze the contribution of the velocity-terms for MBHBs in the mass range $[10^6,10^8]\:\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ using a modified version of the state-of-the-art response simulator lisagwresponse. We find that corrections introduce residual SNRs up to $\sim 2$ for the loudest events and fractional differences up to $0.04\%$, compared to lisagwresponse. While small, these effects are comparable to current waveform modeling uncertainties and imprint distinctive sky-localization signatures, making them potentially relevant for parameter estimation of high-mass MBHBs and simulation of mock datasets.</description>

      <title>Local Expansion Mechanisms for Quantum-Scale Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of quantum spacetime that are consistent with quantum energy inequalities potentially enable the formation of Planck scale wormholes. Building on the proposal of Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever that such microscopic spacetime structures might be enlarged to macroscopic size, we revisit Roman's analysis of a wormhole in an inflationary de Sitter background. In this context, we introduce a refined quasi-local toy mechanism, which we call the local inflation bubble. This construction inflates a compact region of spacetime and thereby magnifies the underlying microstructure. Using the Einstein equations we determine the required stress-energy to sustain the bubble and obtain intrinsic lower bounds for the corresponding energy density, while acknowledging the continued reliance on exotic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study (scalar, not necessarily conformal) quantum fields on self-similar spacetimes. It is shown that in states respecting the self-similarity the expectation value of the stress tensor gives rise to a quantum Lyapunov exponent $\omega_q = 2$, with a leading coefficient which is geometric. Two examples for states respecting self-similarity are discussed. Our findings are in contradiction with results obtained via dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>GW231109_235456: A Sub-threshold Binary Neutron Star Merger in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a Observing Run?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a sub-threshold search for gravitational-wave inspirals from binary neutron stars using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model based on radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of about one per 50 years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7, which was first reported by the LVK in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five from the four LVK searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the reported candidate is approximately one per 10 years. If this event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 (+0.38, -0.07) solar masses. The event was localized to a region of 450 square degrees (90 percent probability) at a luminosity distance of 165 (+70, -69) megaparsecs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex states of quantum gravity in flat and AdS gravity can have features that are inaccessible to classical asymptotic observers. The missing information appears to such observers to be hidden behind a horizon or in a baby universe. Here we use the gravitational path integral to ask whether quantum observables can access the hidden data. We show that generic probes give a universal result and contain no information about the state. However, a probe appropriately fine-tuned to the state can give a large signal because of novel wormhole saddles in the path integral. Thus, in these settings, asymptotic observers cannot easily determine the state of the universe, but can check a proposal for it. Using these fine-tuned probes we show that an asymptotic observer can detect information hidden in a disconnected baby universe. Furthermore we show that the state of a two-boundary black hole can be detected using Lorentzian operators localised on just one of the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Trends in the Population of Binary Black Holes Following the Fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog: a Data-Driven Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current population models of binary black hole distributions are difficult to interpret because standard population inferences hinge on modeling choices, which can mask or mimic real structure. The maximum population likelihood ``$\pistroke$ formalism'' provides a means to investigate and interpret features in the distribution of binary black holes using only data -- without specifying a population model. It tells us if features inferred from current population models are truly present in the data or if they arise from model misspecification. It also provides guidance for developing new models by highlighting previously unnoticed features. In this study, we utilize the $\pistroke$ formalism to examine the binary black hole population in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4). Our analysis supports the existence of a gap around $45\,M_\odot$ in the secondary black hole mass distribution and identifies a widening in the distribution of the effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_\text{eff}$ near this mass as recently reported by Tong et al. (2025). Similar to earlier studies, we find support for an anti-correlation between $\chi_\text{eff}$ and mass ratio. However, we argue that this may be a spurious correlation arising from misspecification of the joint distribution of black hole masses. Furthermore, we identify support for dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes at approximately $\chi \approx 0.2$ and $\chi\approx0.7$. The data support the existence of a correlation between the spin magnitudes $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, though subsequent study is required to determine if this feature is statistically significant. The accompanying data release includes $\pistroke$ samples, which can be used to compare theoretical predictions to LVK data and to assess assumptions in parameterised models.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained BCFT Tensor Networks and Holographic Reflected Entropy in 3D Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of $\textit{BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.</description>

      <title>The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</description>

Abstract: As the compact binary catalog continues to grow rapidly, developing and refining tests to probe the nature of compact objects is essential for a comprehensive understanding of both the observed data and the underlying astrophysics of the binary population. We investigate the effectiveness of spin-induced multipole moments (SIQM) and tidal deformability measurements in distinguishing lower mass-gap black hole (BH) binaries from non-BH binaries with different mass and spin configurations. We perform model-agnostic tests on binary BH (BBH) simulations using full Bayesian inference, evaluating the independent and joint measurability of SIQM and tidal parameters across the parameter space. We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting spinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and tidal effects and (b) each effect individually. For case (a), recovery is performed using (i) a BBH model, (ii) a model incorporating both SIQM and tidal effects, and (iii) models including either SIQM or tidal effects. For case (b), we employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal effects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform model and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes. We find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to biases in parameter inference. Notably, when analyzing a simulated binary boson star-like signal with component masses $\rm{(4, 4) \, M_{\odot}}$ using a BBH model, the system is incorrectly identified as having masses $\rm{(8, 2) \, M_{\odot}}$. In contrast, using the correct recovery model that includes both SIQM and tidal deformability effects successfully recovers the true masses, highlighting the significance of waveform model accuracy in performing reliable distinguishability tests for compact objects in the low-mass gap.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, and its cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00989v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric teleparallel gravity and its $f(Q)$ extensions have emerged as promising alternatives to General Relativity (GR), yet the role of explicit geometry-matter couplings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a generalized $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$ theory, where the gravitational Lagrangian density depends on both the non-metricity scalar $Q$ and the matter Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_m$. This formulation naturally includes Coincident GR and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of GR as special cases. Working in the metric formalism, we derive the corresponding field equations, which generalize those of the standard $f(Q)$ gravity, and obtain the modified Klein-Gordon equation for scenarios involving scalar fields. The cosmological implications of the theory are explored in the context of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. As a first step, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity in full generality. We then investigate specific cosmological models arising from both linear and non-linear choices of $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$, performing detailed comparisons with the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and examining their observational consequences.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Dark Phases in Scalar Particles within the Schwarzschild-Kiselev-Letelier Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the emergence of dark phases (dark energy-induced phases) in the radial wave function of scalar particles. We achieve this by presenting novel solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime, which encompasses a black hole, a quintessential fluid, and a cloud of strings. We determine the exact solution for the spacetime metric, analyze the admissible ranges for its physical parameters, and discuss the formation of the event horizon. Subsequently, we detail the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation and explore three distinct cases of dark phases, corresponding to the quintessence state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$ taking the values $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. Notably, the case where $\alpha_{Q} = 1$ holds particular significance due to current observational constraints on dark energy.</description>

      <title>Multishell Dirac fermions in the Einstein-Dirac system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present multifermions in the spherically symmetric Einstein-Dirac system. Dirac fermions are self-localized within a spherically symmetric Einstein gravity, i.e., the Schwarzschild-like space-time metric. Most of previous studies of the Einstein-Dirac system are restricted to two neutral fermions or to many fermions with the same high-angular momentum filling a single shell. Our model considers full-filling of fermions in multiple shells, similarly to the conventional nuclear shell model. We solve the model for fermion numbers $N_\textrm{f}=2,6,12$ and $20$, which can realize a spherically symmetric system. Even single-shell multifermions exhibit a multipeak structure and fragmentation in the high redshift region. The behavior observed in our multishell model can be explained by interactions between the shells and resulting delocalization. We also investigate the pressure of the solutions which defines the existence (or absence) of intershell interactions. The radial pressure is attractive, supporting compactness of the solutions. Finally, we show the correlations between the nontrivial changes in the Shannon entropy (a logarithmic measure of information content) and the structural deformations of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accelerated charge interacts with itself through the electromagnetic field that it sources, a phenomenon known as electromagnetic radiation reaction. The DeWitt-Brehme-Hobbs (DWBH) equation describes the motion of a charged mass in the presence of combined electromagnetic and gravitational fields, taking into account electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects. Here, we find the first exact analytical solution of the DWBH equation in the case of a charged mass in the presence of copropagating and otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic and gravitational plane waves. Apart from its intrinsic importance, this solution approximates that of an ultrarelativistic particle in arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Finally, the paradigmatic example of an electromagnetic wave in the presence of a constant-amplitude gravitational wave is worked out explicitly and it shows how the presence of the gravitational wave can qualitatively change electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Boson Ionization from Comparable-Mass Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally bound states analogous to molecules once the binary separation decreases below the boson's Bohr radius, with the inner region co-moving with the binary. We simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions, demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.</description>

      <title>Comment on the cosmological constant for $\lambda \phi^4$ theory in $d$ spacetime dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent article we showed that the analog of the cosmological constant in two spacetime dimensions for a wide variety of integrable quantum field theories has the form $\rho_{\rm vac} = - m^2 /2 \mathfrak{g} $ where $m$ is a physical mass and $\mathfrak{g} $ is a generalized coupling, where in the free field limit $\mathfrak{g} \to 0$, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ diverges. We speculated that in four spacetime dimensions $\rho_{\rm vac} $ takes a similar form $\rho_{\rm vac} = - m^4/2 \mathfrak{g}$, but did not support this idea in any specific model. In this article we study this problem for $\lambda \phi^4$ theory in $d$ spacetime dimensions. We show how to obtain the exact $\rho_{\rm vac}$ for the sinh-Gordon theory in the weak coupling limit by using a saddle point approximation. This calculation indicates that the cosmological constant can be well-defined, positive or negative, without spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also show that $\rho_{\rm vac}$ satisfies a Callan-Symanzik type of renormalization group equation. For the most interesting case physically, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ is positive and can arise from a marginally relevant negative coupling $\mathfrak{g}$ and the cosmological constant flows to zero at low energies.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's \textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. If improvements in reducing \textit{Cassini} era noise by a factor of $\sim$10 are implemented, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(\rm{few})$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars: From Static Structure to Rotational Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impacts of dark matter (DM) on the properties of both static and rotating neutron stars utilizing a self-interacting DM model, motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. DM-admixed NSs are modeled by assuming chemical equilibrium between ordinary matter and the dark sector, treating a single-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) framework. By treating the DM interaction strength ($G$) as a free parameter, we explore its influence on NS properties, considering a broad range of equations of state (EoSs). Using the mass-radius constraints from NICER pulsar measurements, we constrain the DM interaction strength for each EoS via a likelihood analysis. Extending this model to rotating NSs, we analyze how centrifugal forces associated with increasing angular velocity ($\Omega$) enhance both mass and radius, causing deformation. We assess the impact of DM on rotational deformation by calculating the eccentricity, highlighting the interplay between DM and rotational forces. Since both DM and rotation simultaneously influence NS properties, we compute the relative changes in mass and radius across varying $G$ and $\Omega$ values to quantify their combined effects.</description>

      <title>Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the renormalisation of Einstein gravity using a novel subtraction scheme in dimensional regularisation. The one-loop beta function for Newton's constant receives contributions from poles in even dimensions and can be mapped to the beta function obtained using a proper-time cutoff. Field redefinitions are used to remove off-shell contributions to the renormalisation group equations. To check the consistency of our approximations we use a general parametrisation of the metric fluctuation. Within truncations of the derivative expansion and the expansion in Newton's constant, we show that the parametrisation dependence can be removed order by order. Going to all orders in the scalar curvature an all-order beta function for Newton's constant is obtained that is independent of the parameterisation. The beta function vanishes at the Reuter fixed point and the critical exponent is in good agreement with non-perturbative calculations. Finally, we compare the critical exponent to the counterpart computed via Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT).</description>

      <title>Modular Intersections, Time Interval Algebras and Emergent AdS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the modular flow and conjugation of time interval algebras of conformal Generalized Free Fields (GFF) in $(0+1)$-dimensions in vacuum. For non-integer scaling dimensions, for general time-intervals, the modular conjugation and the modular flow of operators outside the algebra are non-geometric. This is because they involve a Generalized Hilbert Transform (GHT) that treats positive and negative frequency modes differently. However, the modular conjugation and flows viewed in the dual bulk AdS$_2$ are local, because the GHT geometrizes as the local antipodal symmetry transformation that pushes operators behind the Poincar\'e horizon. These algebras of conformal GFF satisfy a $\textit{Twisted Modular Inclusion}$ and a $\textit{Twisted Modular Intersection}$ property. We prove the converse statement that the existence of a (twisted) modular inclusion/intersection in any quantum system implies a representation of the (universal cover of) conformal group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$, respectively. We discuss the implications of our result for the emergence of Stringy AdS$_2$ geometries in large $N$ theories without a large gap. Our result applied to higher dimensional eternal AdS black holes explains the emergence of two copies of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on future and past Killing horizons.</description>

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation and are recognized for their computational complexity. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH). We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. As a case study, we apply our pipeline, which we call \texttt{ReGrayssion}, to the study of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter (DM) candidates, deriving constraints on the abundance from observations of diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions, offering a new pathway for investigating PBH as a DM candidate.</description>

Abstract: In early 2024, ESA formally adopted the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission with the aim of measuring gravitational waves emitted in the millihertz range. The constellation employs three spacecraft that exchange laser beams to form interferometric measurements over a distance of 2.5 million kilometers. The measurements will then be telemetered down to Earth at a lower sampling frequency. Anti-aliasing filters will be used on board to limit spectral folding of out-of-band laser noise. The dominant noise in these measurements is laser frequency noise which does not cancel naturally in LISA's unequal-arm heterodyne interferometers. Suppression of this noise requires time-shifting of the data using delay operators to build virtual beam paths that simulate equal-arm interferometers. The non-commutativity of these delay operators and on-board filters manifests as a noise (flexing-filtering) that significantly contributes to the noise budget. This non-commutativity is a consequence of the non-flatness of the filter in-band. Attenuation of this noise requires high-order and computationally expensive filters, putting additional demands on the spacecraft. The following work studies an alternative method to reduce this flexing filtering noise via the introduction of a modified delay operator that accounts for the non-commutativity with the filter in the delay operation itself. Our approach allows us to reduce the flexing-filtering noise by over six orders of magnitude whilst reducing the dependency on the flatness of the filter. The work is supplemented by numerical simulations of the data processing chain that compare the results with those of the standard approach.</description>

      <title>Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs), driven by periodic modulation of the $s$-wave scattering length. Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram that maps the competitive interplay between the unstable tongues of parametric resonance and the intrinsic Jeans instability. The diagram reveals that increasing the driving frequency compresses the Jeans-unstable region and allows well-separated parametric resonance tongues to dominate, thereby creating a clear regime for observing Faraday waves. Conversely, lowering the driving frequency expands the domain of Jeans instability, which fragments and overwhelms the parametric resonance structures. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal a characteristic transition from parametric-resonance-driven Faraday waves to gravity-dominated Jeans collapse as the Jeans frequency increases.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram</title>

Abstract: We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Symmetry TFTs for Continuous Spacetime Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous spacetime symmetries. For a $d$-dimensional theory, it is given by a $(d+1)$-dimensional BF-theory for the spacetime symmetry group, and whenever $d$ is even, it can also include Chern-Simons couplings that encode conformal and gravitational anomalies. We study the boundary conditions for this SymTFT and describe the general setup to study symmetry breaking of spacetime symmetries. We then specialize to the conformal symmetry case and derive the dilaton action for conformal symmetry breaking. To further substantiate that our setup captures spacetime symmetries, we demonstrate that the topological defects of the SymTFT realize the associated spacetime symmetry transformations. Finally, we study the relation to gravity and holography. The proposal classically coincides with two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for $d=1$ as well as the topological limit of four-dimensional gravity in the $d=3$ case.</description>
