      <title>Sockeye: a language for analyzing hardware documentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems programmers have to consolidate the ever growing hardware mess present on modern System-on-Chips (SoCs). Correctly programming a multitude of components, providing functionality but also security, is a difficult problem: semantics of individual units are described in English prose, descriptions are often underspecified, and prone to inaccuracies. Rigorous statements about platform security are often impossible.
  We introduce a domain-specific language to describe hardware semantics, assumptions about software behavior, and desired security properties. We then create machine-readable specifications for a diverse set of eight SoCs from their reference manuals, and formally prove their (in-)security. In addition to security proofs about memory confidentiality and integrity, we discover a handful of documentation errors. Finally, our analysis also revealed a vulnerability on a real-world server chip. Our tooling offers system integrators a way of formally describing security properties for entire SoCs, and means to prove them or find counterexamples to them.</description>

      <title>A Practical-Driven Framework for Transitioning Drive-by-Wire to Autonomous Driving Systems: A Case Study with a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transitioning from a Drive-by-Wire (DBW) system to a fully autonomous driving system (ADS) involves multiple stages of development and demands robust positioning and sensing capabilities. This paper presents a practice-driven framework for facilitating the DBW-to-ADS transition using a 2022 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Minivan equipped with cameras, LiDAR, GNSS, and onboard computing hardware configured with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Autoware.AI. The implementation showcases offline autonomous operations utilizing pre-recorded LiDAR and camera data, point clouds, and vector maps, enabling effective localization and path planning within a structured test environment. The study addresses key challenges encountered during the transition, particularly those related to wireless-network-assisted sensing and positioning. It offers practical solutions for overcoming software incompatibility constraints, sensor synchronization issues, and limitations in real-time perception. Furthermore, the integration of sensing, data fusion, and automation is emphasized as a critical factor in supporting autonomous driving systems in map generation, simulation, and training. Overall, the transition process outlined in this work aims to provide actionable strategies for researchers pursuing DBW-to-ADS conversion. It offers direction for incorporating real-time perception, GNSS-LiDAR-camera integration, and fully ADS-equipped autonomous vehicle operations, thus contributing to the advancement of robust autonomous vehicle technologies.</description>
