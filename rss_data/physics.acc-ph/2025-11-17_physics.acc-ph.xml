      <title>A Hybrid Neural Architecture: Online Attosecond X-ray Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of high-repetition-rate x-ray free-electron lasers, such as SLAC's LCLS-II, serve as our canonical example for autonomous controls that necessitate high-throughput diagnostics paired with streaming computational pipelines capable of single-shot analysis with extremely low latency. We present the Deterministic Characterization with an Integrated Parallelizable Hybrid Resolver architecture, a hybrid machine learning framework designed for fast, accurate analysis of XFEL diagnostics using angular streaking-based sinogram images. This architecture integrates convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory models to denoise input, identify x-ray sub-spike features, and extract sub-spike relative delays with sub-30 attosecond temporal resolution. Deployed on low-latency hardware, it achieves over 10~kHz throughput with \SI{168.3}{\micro\second} inference latency, indicating scalability to 14~kHz with FPGA integration. By transforming regression tasks into classification problems and leveraging optimized error encoding, we achieve high precision with low-latency performance that is critical for real-time streaming event selection and experimental control feedback signals. This represents a key development in real-time control pipelines for next-generation autonomous science, generally, and high repetition-rate x-ray experiments in particular.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Assisted Modeling for $\chi^{(2)}$ Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling second-order ($\chi^{(2)}$) nonlinear optical processes remains computationally expensive due to the need to resolve fast field oscillations and simulate wave propagation using methods like the split-step Fourier method (SSFM). This can become a bottleneck in real-time applications, such as high-repetition-rate laser systems requiring rapid feedback and control. We present an LSTM-based surrogate model trained on SSFM simulations generated from a start-to-end model of the photocathode drive laser at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's Linac Coherent Light Source II. The model achieves over 250x speedup while maintaining high fidelity, enabling future real-time optimization and laying the foundation for data-integrated modeling frameworks and digital twins of laser systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent synchrotron radiation by excitation of surface plasmon polariton on near-critical solid microtube surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is crucial for the development of powerful ultrashort light sources. We present a mechanism for generating CSR in the form of generalised superradiance, based on surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are resonantly excited on a solid, near-critical-density inner surface of a microtube. A high-intensity, circularly polarised laser pulse, propagating along the microtube axis, efficiently couples the cylindrical SPP modes. This process creates azimuthally structured, rotating electromagnetic fields. These rotating fields subsequently confine, modulate, and directly accelerate surface electrons to emit CSR in the Vavilov-Cherenkov angle. We further demonstrate that by improving the azimuthal symmetry of these electrons, the helical modulation enables CSR emission across all azimuthal directions in the form of isolated harmonics, significantly enhancing radiation intensity even when full coherence is imperfect. Our full 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations indicate this scheme can generate X-rays with coherence enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to incoherent emission. The challenges to experimentally realise this scheme are discussed, including the need for high-contrast lasers to prevent pre-plasma formation and the demanding tolerances for microtube fabrication and alignment, while these challenges are not beyond the scope of existing or near-future experimental capabilities.</description>
