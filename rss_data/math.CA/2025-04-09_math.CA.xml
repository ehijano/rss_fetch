      <title>Developing a novel hybrid family associated with hypergeometric functions through umbral techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The umbral methods are used to reformulate the theoretical framework of special functions and provide powerful techniques for uncovering new extensions and relationships among these functions. This research article introduces an innovative class of special polynomials, specifically the hypergeometric-Appell polynomials. The fundamental attributes of this versatile family of special polynomials are outlined, including generating relations, explicit representations, and differential recurrence relations. Certain particular examples that belong to the class of hypergeometric-Appell polynomials are also considered. This article aims to reinforce the broad applicability of the umbral approach to address complex mathematical challenges and contribute to various scientific and engineering endeavors.</description>

      <title>Functional It\^o-formula and Taylor expansions for non-anticipative maps of c\`adl\`ag rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a functional It\^o-formula for non-anticipative maps of rough paths, based on the approximation properties of the signature of c\`adl\`ag rough paths. This result is a functional extension of the It\^o-formula for c\`adl\`ag rough paths (by Friz and Zhang (2018)), which coincides with the change of variable formula formulated by Dupire (2009) whenever the functionals' representations, the notions of regularity, and the integration concepts can be matched. Unlike these previous works, we treat the vertical (jump) pertubation via the Marcus transformation, which allows for incorporating path functionals where the second order vertical derivatives do not commute, as is the case for typical signature functionals. As a byproduct, we show that sufficiently regular non-anticipative maps admit a functional Taylor expansion in terms of the path's signature, leading to an important generalization of the recent results by Dupire and Tissot-Daguette (2022).</description>

      <title>Structure of measures for which Ehrhard symmetrization is perimeter non-increasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that isotropic Gaussian functions are \textit{characterized} by a rearrangement inequality for weighted perimeter in dimensions $n \geq 2$ within the class of non-negative weights in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n) \cap W^{1,1}_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. More specifically, we prove that within this class, generalized Ehrhard symmetrization is perimeter non-increasing for all measurable sets in all directions if and only if the distribution function is an isotropic Gaussian. The class of non-negative $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n) \cap W^{1,1}_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^n)$-weights is the broadest class in which this problem can be posed for distributional perimeter. One of the main challenges in this paper is handling these weights without imposing any additional structure. Principally, we establish that generalized Ehrhard symmetrization preserves $\mu$-measurability through a novel approximation argument. Additionally, our proof that a rearrangement inequality for weighted perimeter implies that half-spaces are isoperimetric sets is new in the context of generalized Ehrhard symmetrization. Moreover, our version of a variational argument, which had previously appeared in [Rosales, 2014] and [Brock-Chiacchio-Mercaldo, 2008], is carried out under minimal regularity. Finally, we establish some basic but useful results for weighted BV functions with non-negative $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n) \cap W^{1,1}_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^n)$-weights which may be of independent interest.</description>
