      <title>Axisymmetric Gyrokinetic Simulation of ASDEX-Upgrade Scrape-off Layer Using a Conservative Implicit BGK Collision Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions play an important role in turbulence and transport of fusion plasmas. For kinetic simulations, as the collisionality increases in the domain of interest, the size of the time step to resolve the collisional physics can become overly restrictive in an explicit time integration scheme, leading to high computational cost. With the aim of overcoming such restriction, we have implemented an implicit Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator for use in the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) full-f gyrokinetic solver within the Gkeyll framework, which, when combined with Gkeyll's traditional explicit time integrator for collisionless advection, can significantly increase the time step in gyrokinetic simulations of highly collisional regimes. To ensure conservation of density, momentum, and energy, we utilize an iterative scheme to correct the discretized approximation to the equilibrium Maxwellian distribution to which the BGK collision operator relaxes. We have further generalized the BGK infrastructure, both the implicit scheme and the correction routine, to handle cross species collisions. This improved implicit and conservative BGK operator is benchmarked against the more accurate but more computationally expensive Lenard-Bernstein-Dougherty (LBD) operator which has been utilized in prior studies with Gkeyll. The implicit BGK operator enables 2D axisymmetric simulations of the ASDEX-Upgrade scrape-off layer to run 56 times faster to completion than the simulations with the LBD operator, because the BGK operator is more robust and converges at a lower resolution than is required by the LBD operator. Additionally, in this more collisional limit, we demonstrate that the results of our simulations utilizing the implicit BGK operator agreed well with simulations utilizing the more computationally expensive LBD operator.</description>

      <title>Formation and Evolution of Pair-Alfv\'en Shocks with PIC Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the recently discovered \emph{pair-Alfv\'en shock wave} occurring in collisionless electron-positron plasmas. We perform a series of Particle-In-Cell studies in one and two dimensions in order to determine the stability conditions for such a shock and the mechanisms which sustain its growth. Building on our previous simulations, which established that these shocks are initially mediated by the Weibel instability before becoming Alfv\'enic, we demonstrate that the shock is sustained by self-generated Alfv\'en waves overtaking the shock in the upstream plasma. As a result growth is only possible when the guiding magnetic field strength, and hence Alfv\'en speed, is sufficiently small, $\omega_c \lesssim 0.4$ (in normalized units). Furthermore the production of the waves in the upstream is dependent on a resonance between the Alfv\'en wave mode and the thermal noise in the plasma, which is inhibited at high magnetization. This explains the conditional absence of this type of shock identified previously.</description>

      <title>Filamentation of the electromagnetic precursor in relativistic quasi-perpendicular electron-positron shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scenario that could explain non-thermal particle acceleration in relativistic quasi-perpendicular electron-positron shocks, such as the termination shock of pulsar wind nebulae. The shock produces a strong electromagnetic precursor that propagates into the upstream plasma, which is initially threaded by a uniform background magnetic field. We show that the filamentation instability breaks the precursor into radiation filaments parallel to the shock normal. The transverse scale of the filaments is of the order of a few plasma skin depths. In the shock frame, the bulk Lorentz factor of the upstream plasma is significantly reduced inside the radiation filaments. Then, the instability produces a relativistic shear flow with strong velocity gradients on kinetic scales. The velocity gradients distort the background magnetic field lines, and generate a magnetic field component parallel to the shock normal that reverses across each radiation filament, a configuration that could trigger magnetic reconnection in the upstream plasma. These effects may accelerate particles before the plasma enters the shock.</description>

      <title>A visual approach to global accretion disk instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over 30 years, the Magneto-Rotational Instability has been accepted as the mechanism driving accretion disk turbulence. Its physical basis is well understood, where an interplay between centrifugal forces and magnetic tension transfers angular momentum between oppositely displaced fluid elements. In this work, we revisit this picture in global disk models and various magnetic field topologies and generalise it to non-axisymmetric instabilities like the Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instability (SARI). We use the open-source \texttt{Legolas} software to quantify all complex-valued linear eigenfunctions for the (near-)eigenmodes and visualise the resulting spatio-temporal variations in real space in a manner that can be compared to direct numerical simulations of disks. The field perturbations are fundamentally different between the (axisymmetric) MRI and the novel, ultra-localised SARI modes, which bear some resemblance to spiral modes in galaxies but differ in important ways. We use a combined numerical-analytical approach to study the polarization of the magnetic and velocity field perturbations. Finally, we compare disks of differing magnetic topology where many linear modes are merely superposed to recreate a visual impression of `turbulent' fields and quantify the resulting stresses. We find that even superposed, still linearly growing SARI modes can already provide the needed effective viscosity-related alpha-values invoked for angular momentum transport. 3D views on the magnetic field perturbations show that SARI modes of opposite azimuthal mode number may naturally introduce plasmoid and toroidal flux-tube like field deformations.</description>

      <title>Fast solvers for Tokamak fluid models with PETSC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16676v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work begins the development of fast, scalable solvers for scientific and engineering-relevant magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models of tokamaks using multigrid methods. These models are characterized by a distinguished direction following the magnetic field around the torus, which dominates the plasma dynamics. All tokamak models exploit this structure, for example, NIMROD uses 2D, unstructured, high-order finite elements in the poloidal plane with Fourier modes in the toroidal coordinate, and the 3D, extended MHD code M3D-C1 uses 2D, unstructured C1 elements in the poloidal plane with cubic Hermite functions in the toroidal direction and a regular grid that is partially aligned with the magnetic field. This structure suggests addressing the toroidal coordinate first, which NIMROD does at the formulation level, but M3D-C1 uses a full 3D discretization. The resulting algebraic system is solved at each time step in an implicit time integrator. This work addressed the toroidal coordinate in the M3D-C1 velocity solve by adding semi-coarsening multigrid to the existing PETSC - Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation - block Jacobi solver, with the addition of little new code. Competitive performance of this new solver configuration is demonstrated on a self-consistent runaway electron model of a SPARC4 disruption, and the next steps in the development of this solver are outlined.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Gauge-Invariant Magnetic Helicity Transport: Basic Formulation and Application to Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamo processes are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems. In relativistic astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks around black holes or neutron stars, they may critically affect the launching of winds and jets that can power electromagnetic emission. Dynamo processes are governed by several microscopic parameters, one of them being magnetic helicity. As a conserved quantity in nonresistive plasmas, magnetic helicity is transported across the system. One important implication of helicity conservation is, that in the absence of helicity fluxes some mean-field dynamos can be quenched, potentially affecting the large-scale evolution of the magnetic field. One of the major challenges in computing magnetic helicity is the need to fix a meaningful electromagnetic gauge. We here present a fully covariant formulation of magnetic helicity transport in general-relativistic plasmas based on the concept of relative helicity by Berger &amp; Field and Finn &amp; Antonsen. This formulation is separately invariant under gauge-transformation of the Maxwell and Einstein equations. As an application of this new formalism we present the first analysis of magnetic helicity transport in the merger of two neutron stars. We demonstrate the presence of global helicity fluxes into the outer layers of the stellar merger remnant, which may impact subsequent large-scale dynamo amplification in these regions.</description>

      <title>A Flare-related Decimetric Type-IV Radio Burst Induced by the X2 Radiation of Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation mechanism of decimetric wideband and pulsating radio bursts from the Sun (in terms of decimetric type-IV (t-IVdm) burst) and other flaring stars is a long-standing problem. Early investigations were based on the leading-spot hypothesis for the sun and yielded contradictory results. Here, we analyzed the flare-associated t-IVdm burst on 20110924 with medium-strong levels of polarization and from sources near a sunspot. We found that the emission is intermittent and the maximum $T_B$ exceeds 10$^{11}$ K, with well-defined upper and lower frequency cutoffs. The radio sources are left-handed polarized, located above the sunspot with a negative polarity. The sources align well with the sites of the second harmonic of the local electron gyrofrequency. These findings provide essential evidence that the burst is induced by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) in the harmonic X mode. We further modeled the transport of downward-streaming energetic electrons along a coronal loop and found most electrons get mirrored within the specific altitude range of 20-100 Mm. This explains why such bursts tend to have well-defined spectral ranges. We also found the ECME-radiating energetic electrons exhibit a shell-like VDF instead of the generally-presumed loss-cone distribution. The study greatly expands the application of ECME in solar radio astronomy and provides solar samples for similar bursts from other flaring stars.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Structure in the Auroral Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The auroral ionosphere presents a paradox: turbulence often thrives in a conductive layer that should suppress the growth rates of plasma instabilities. Using a novel composite power spectrum from coherent radar and GPS data, we show that turbulence on a wide range of scales stem not from local instabilities. Instead, its spectrum is a structural imprint of field-aligned electrical currents, and its dissipative character is governed by the flux of precipitating particles. Our measurements provide a clear geophysical example of a driven, emergent system of self-organized dissipative structures.</description>
