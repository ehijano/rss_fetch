      <title>From fair price to fair volatility: Towards an Efficiency-Consistent Definition of Financial Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volatility, as a primary indicator of financial risk, forms the foundation of classical frameworks such as Markowitz's Portfolio Theory and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). However, its conventional use rests on assumptions-most notably, the Markovian nature of price dynamics-that often fail to reflect key empirical characteristics of financial markets. Fractional stochastic volatility models expose these limitations by demonstrating that volatility alone is insufficient to capture the full structure of return dispersion. In this context, we propose pointwise regularity, measured via the Hurst-Holder exponent, as a complementary metric of financial risk. This measure quantifies local deviations from martingale behavior, enabling a more nuanced assessment of market inefficiencies and the mechanisms by which equilibrium is restored. By accounting not only for the magnitude but also for the nature of randomness, this framework bridges the conceptual divide between efficient market theory and behavioral finance.</description>

      <title>Bridging Econometrics and AI: VaR Estimation via Reinforcement Learning and GARCH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an environment of increasingly volatile financial markets, the accurate estimation of risk remains a major challenge. Traditional econometric models, such as GARCH and its variants, are based on assumptions that are often too rigid to adapt to the complexity of the current market dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework for Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation, combining GARCH volatility models with deep reinforcement learning. Our approach incorporates directional market forecasting using the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) model, treating the task as an imbalanced classification problem. This architecture enables the dynamic adjustment of risk-level forecasts according to market conditions. Empirical validation on daily Eurostoxx 50 data covering periods of crisis and high volatility shows a significant improvement in the accuracy of VaR estimates, as well as a reduction in the number of breaches and also in capital requirements, while respecting regulatory risk thresholds. The ability of the model to adjust risk levels in real time reinforces its relevance to modern and proactive risk management.</description>
