      <title>Bose-Hubbard Model on a Honeycomb Superlattice: Quantum Phase Transitions and Lattice Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model on a honeycomb superlattice. The interplay between the superlattice potential depth $\Delta/t$ and the onsite interaction $U/t$ gives rise to three distinct quantum phases at zero temperature: a superfluid phase, a Mott insulator I phase with unit filling on each site, and a Mott insulator II phase characterized by density imbalance-double occupancy on one sublattice and vacancy on the other at unit filling. The SF-MI transitions are found to be continuous, consistent with second-order quantum phase transitions. We further extend our analysis to finite temperatures within the superfluid regime. Our work highlights how a honeycomb superlattice geometry enables access to interaction- and lattice-modulation-driven quantum phases, including a density-imbalanced Mott insulator and a robust superfluid regime, offering concrete theoretical predictions for cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Traveling supersolid stripe patterns in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a traveling supersolid stripe pattern in a spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas. This configuration is associated with an unequal occupation of the two single-particle energy minima, giving rise to a chemical potential difference that sets the fringe velocity. Unlike stationary stripes, the moving pattern is spin-polarized, with decreasing contrast as momentum increases, eventually leading to stripe melting and transition to the uniform plane-wave phase. The Bogoliubov spectrum of the moving stripes exhibits asymmetry under inversion of the excitation quasimomentum. At high momentum, we identify energetic and dynamical instabilities in the spin-phonon mode which transforms to the roton mode of the plane-wave phase as the stripe structure vanishes.</description>

      <title>Universal Efimov spectra and fermionic doublets in highly mass-imbalanced cold-atom mixtures with van der Waals and dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced three-body systems composed of two identical heavy atoms and one light atom, focusing on the Er-Er-Li and Dy-Dy-Li cold-atom mixtures with strong dipole-dipole interactions between the heavy atoms. By solving the Born-Oppenheimer equation for varying $s$-wave scattering lengths between the heavy and light atoms, we demonstrate for both bosonic and fermionic systems that the Efimov spectra and hence the three-body parameters are universal even with the dipole interaction comparable in strength to the van der Waals interaction. While the bosonic systems exhibit Efimov states only in the $M_z=0$ channel, the fermionic systems show a characteristic doublet of the Efimov states in the $M_z=0$ and $M_z = \pm 1$ channels due to the interplay of finite angular momentum and the anisotropy of the dipole interaction. Both numerical results and analytical formula obtained with the first-order perturbation show that the ratio of the three-body parameters between these two fermionic channels exhibits universality, particularly well in the limit of large mass imbalance. Leveraging this universality, we provide quantitative predictions for the values and ratios of the three-body parameters for experimentally relevant Er-Li and Dy-Li isotopes.</description>

      <title>Cavity Optomechanical Quantum Memory for Twisted Photons Using a Ring BEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) quantum memory platform based on an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a ring trap and placed inside a Fabry-Perot cavity driven by Laguerre-Gaussian beams. In contrast to electromagnetically induced transparency-based protocols, our memory does not require change of internal atomic levels. The optical states are instead stored in the large Hilbert space of topologically protected and long-lived motional states (persistent currents) of the condensate, yielding a storage time three orders of magnitude better than presently available. Further, the use of a cavity provides orders of magnitude more resonances, and hence bandwidth, for reading and writing than internal atomic transitions. Finally, the analogy to cavity optomechanics suggests a natural path to wavelength conversion, OAM transduction, and nondestructive readout of the memory.</description>

      <title>Engineering and harnessing long-range interactions for atomic quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between quantum particles, such as electrons, are the source of important effects, ranging from superconductivity, to the formation of molecular bonds, or the stability of elementary compounds at high-energies. In this article, we illustrate how advances in the cold-atom community to further engineer such long-range interactions have stimulated the simulation of new regimes of these fundamental many-body problems. The goal is two-fold: first, to provide a comprehensive review of the different strategies proposed and/or experimentally realized to induce long-range interactions among atoms moving in optical potentials. Second, to showcase various fields where such platforms can offer new insights, ranging from the simulation of condensed matter phenomena to the study of lattice gauge theories, and the simulation of electronic configurations in chemistry. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities of these platforms compared to other complementary approaches based on digital simulation and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Discrete Time Crystals in the quasiperiodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.05318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete time crystal (DTC) is a remarkable non-equilibrium phase of matter characterized by the persistent sub-harmonic oscillations of physical observables in periodically driven many-body systems. Motivated by the question of whether such a temporal periodic order can persist when the drive becomes aperiodic, we investigate the dynamics of a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model under quasiperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driving. Intriguingly, this infinite-range-interacting spin system can host ``quasi-discrete time crystal" (quasi-DTC) phases characterized by periodic oscillations of the magnetization. We demonstrate that our model can host the quasi-DTC analog of both period-doubling DTCs as well as higher-order DTCs. These quasi-DTCs are robust to various perturbations, and they originate from the interplay of ``all-to-all" interactions and the recursive structure of the TM sequence. Our results suggest that quasi-periodic driving protocols can provide a promising route for realizing novel non-equilibrium phases of matter in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Topological floating phase of dipolar bosons in an optical ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15710v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar hard-core bosons in optical ladders provide exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of anisotropic XXZ spin ladders. We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the study of the entanglement spectrum, reveals that the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar XXZ ladders can be investigated in on-going experiments.</description>

      <title>Observation of slow relaxation due to Hilbert space fragmentation in strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While isolated quantum systems generally thermalize after long-time evolution, there are several exceptions defying thermalization. A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large number of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide an experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF.</description>

      <title>Theory of itinerant collisional spin dynamics in nondegenerate molecular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Simulating Meson Scattering on Spin Quantum Simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Floquet Amorphous Topological Orders in a One-dimensional Rydberg Glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological orders in amorphous systems that lack crystalline symmetry have gained considerable attention recently. Here we propose the Floquet amorphous topological matter, among which the topological orders are explored in experimentally accessible one-dimensional array of randomly pointed Rydberg atoms with periodic driving. The topological properties are comprehensively characterized, considering both the single-particle and many-body perspectives. It is found that the periodic driving leads to rich topological phases of matter. At the single-particle level, we evaluate the real space winding numbers and polarization, revealing robust amorphous topological phases with 0-type and $\pi$-type edge modes. We show a structural disorder induced topological phase transition associated with localization transition in the nonequilibrium system. Remarkably, in the many-body case it is discovered that the amorphous topological order exists in the chain of hardcore bosons, captured by the topological entanglement entropy and the string order. Moreover, feasible experimental probe protocols are also elaborated.</description>

      <title>A normalized gradient flow method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by using the normalized gradient flow (NGF). In order to successfully extend the NGF to spin-2 BECs which has five components in the vector wave function but with only two physical constraints on total mass conservation and magnetization conservation, two important techniques are introduced for designing the proposed numerical method. The first one is to systematically investigate the ground state structure and property of spin-2 BECs within a spatially uniform system, which can be used on how to properly choose initial data in the NGF for computing ground states of spin-2 BECs. The second one is to introduce three additional projection conditions based on the relations between the chemical potentials, together with the two existing physical constraints, such that the five projection parameters used in the projection step of the NGF can be uniquely determined. Then a backward-forward Euler finite difference method is adapted to discretize the NGF. We prove rigorously that there exists a unique solution of the nonlinear system for determining the five projection parameters in the full discretization of the NGF under a mild condition on the time step size. Extensive numerical results on ground states of spin-2 BECs with different types of phases and under different potentials are reported to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method and to demonstrate several interesting physical phenomena on ground states of spin-2 BECs.</description>

Abstract: Periodic driving of particles can create crystalline structures in their dynamics. Such systems can be used to study solid-state physics phenomena in the time domain. In addition, it is possible to realize photonic time crystals and to engineer the wave-number band structure of optical devices by periodic temporal modulation of the properties of light-propagating media. Here we introduce a versatile approach which uses traveling wave resonators to emulate various condensed matter phases in the time dimension. This is achieved by utilizing temporal modulation of the permittivity and the shape of small segments of the resonators. The required frequency and depth of the modulation are experimentally achievable which opens a pathway for the practical realisation of crystalline structures in time in microwave and in optical systems.</description>

Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. Fixing instead the gauge freedom using the parallel-transport gauge uniquely decomposes Floquet dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical average-energy operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy splitting in discrete time crystals or $\pi$-edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates.
