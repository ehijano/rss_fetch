      <title>Contrast Enhancement of Barely Visible Impact Damage using Speckle-Based Dark-Field Radiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barely visible impact damage (BVID) can cause serious issue for composite structures, due to sub-surface damage seriously reducing the strength of the material without showing easily detectable surface signs. Dark-field imaging measures ultra-small angle scattering caused by microscopic features within samples. It is sensitive to damage in composite materials which would otherwise be invisible in conventional radiography. Here we demonstrate BVID detection with speckle-based dark-field imaging, a technique requiring only sandpaper (to create the speckle-pattern) in addition to a conventional X-ray imaging setup to extract the dark-field imaging. We demonstrate that the technique is capable of detecting both matrix cracking and delaminations by imaging materials susceptible to these failure mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Virtual VNA 3.1: Non-Coherent-Detection-Based Non-Reciprocal Scattering Matrix Estimation Leveraging a Tunable Load Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine the recently introduced "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique to remove the need for coherent detection. The resulting "Virtual VNA 3.1" technique can unambiguously estimate the full scattering matrix of a non-reciprocal, linear, passive, time-invariant device under test (DUT) with $N$ monomodal ports using an $N_\mathrm{A}$-channel coherent wavefront generator and an $N_\mathrm{A}$-channel non-coherent detector, where $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$. Waves are injected and received only via a fixed set of $N_\mathrm{A}$ "accessible" DUT ports while the remaining $N_\mathrm{S}$ "not-directly-accessible" DUT ports are terminated by a specific tunable load network. To resolve all ambiguities, an additional modified setup is required in which waves are injected and received via a known $2N_\mathrm{A}$-port system connected to the DUT's accessible ports. We experimentally validate our method for $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$ considering a non-reciprocal eight-port circuit as DUT. By eliminating the need for coherent detection, our work reduces the hardware complexity which may facilitate applications to large-scale or higher-frequency systems. Additionally, our work provides fundamental insights into the minimal requirements to fully and unambiguously characterize a non-reciprocal DUT.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Efficient Kidney Stone Fragment Removal via Spinner-Induced Synergistic Circulation and Spiral Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kidney stones can cause severe pain and complications such as chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), which uses laser lithotripsy to fragment stones for removal via a ureteroscope, is widely adopted due to its safety and effectiveness. However, conventional fragment removal methods using basketing and vacuum-assisted aspiration are inefficient, as they can capture only 1 to 3 fragments (1--3\,mm in size) per pass, often requiring dozens to hundreds of ureteroscope passes during a single procedure to completely remove the fragments. These limitations lead to prolonged procedures and residual fragments that contribute to high recurrence rates. To address these limitations, we present a novel spinner device that enables ultra-efficient fragment removal through spinning-induced localized suction. The spinner generates a three-dimensional spiral and circulating flow field that dislodges and draws fragments into its cavity even from distances over 20\,mm, eliminating the need to chase fragments. It can capture over 60 fragments (0.5--2\,mm) or over 15 larger fragments (2--3\,mm) in a single pass, significantly improving removal efficiency. In this work, the spinner design is optimized via computational fluid dynamics to maximize suction performance. \textit{In vitro} testing demonstrates near 100\% capture rates for up to 60 fragments in a single operation and superior large-distance capture efficacy compared to vacuum-assisted methods. \textit{Ex vivo} testing of the integrated spinner-ureteroscope system in a porcine kidney confirmed its high performance by capturing 45 fragments in just 4 seconds during a single pass and achieving complete fragment clearance within a few passes.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip integration of 2D materials with exceptional optical properties provides an attractive solution for next-generation photonic integrated circuits to address the limitations of conventional bulk integrated platforms. Over the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in the interdisciplinary field of 2D material integrated photonics, greatly narrowing the gap between laboratory research and industrial applications. In this paper, we provide a perspective on the developments of this field towards industrial manufacturing and commercialization. First, we review recent progress towards commercialization. Next, we provide an overview of cutting-edge fabrication techniques, which are categorized into large-scale integration, precise patterning, dynamic tuning, and device packaging. Both the advantages and limitations of these techniques are discussed in relation to industrial manufacturing. Finally, we highlight some important issues related to commercialization, including fabrication standards, recycling, service life, and environmental implications.</description>

      <title>Ideal antiferroelectricity with large digital electrostrain in PbZrO3 epitaxial thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics exhibit reversible antipolar-polar phase transitions under electric fields, yielding large electrostrain suitable for electromechanical devices. Nevertheless, in thin-film form, the antiferroelectric behavior is often obscured by competing ferroic orders, resulting in slanted hysteresis loops with undesired remnant polarization, subsequently posing challenges in obtaining ideal antiferroelectricity and understanding their intrinsic electrical behavior. Here, atomistic models for controllable antiferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transition pathways are unveiled along specific crystallographic directions. Guided by the anisotropic phase transition and orientation design, we achieved ideal antiferroelectricity with square double hysteresis loop, large saturated polarization (~60 {\mu}C/cm2), near-zero remnant polarization, fast response time (~75 ns), and near-fatigue-free performance (~10^10 cycles) in (111)P-oriented PbZrO3 epitaxial thin films. Moreover, a bipolar and frequency-independent digital electrostrain (~0.83%) were demonstrated in this architype antiferroelectric system. In-situ X-ray diffraction studies further reveal that the large digital electrostrain results from intrinsic field-induced antiferroelectric-ferroelectric structural transition. This work demonstrates the anisotropic phase transition mechanism and ideal antiferroelectricity with large digital electrostrain in antiferroelectric thin films, offering a new avenue for applications of antiferroelectricity in nanoelectromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Ion Beam Centroid Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An activity of the TRIUMF automatic beam tuning program, the Bayesian optimization for Ion Steering, BOIS, method has been developed to perform corrective centroid steering of beams at the TRIUMF ISAC facility. BOIS exclusively controls the steerers for centroid correction after the transverse optics have been set according to theory. The method is fully online, easy to deploy, and has been tested in low energy and postaccelerated beams at ISAC, achieving results comparable to human operators. scaleBOIS and boundBOIS are naive proof of concept solutions to preferably select beam paths with minimal steering. Repeatable and robust automated steering reduces reliance on operator expertise and operational overhead, ensuring reliable beam delivery to the experiments and thereby supporting TRIUMF's scientific mission.</description>

      <title>Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study on the aging behavior of 18650-type lithium-ion batteries, focusing on the uneven intercalation of lithium ions during fast charging processes. It introduces a novel approach using color visual recognition technology to analyze color changes in the graphite anode, indicative of lithiation levels. The study employs X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Distribution of Relaxation Time (DRT) techniques to validate and analyze the observations. The study emphasizes the significance of electrode impedance, the positioning of battery tabs, and electrolyte distribution in influencing the aging dynamics of lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the paper presents an innovative impedance Transport-Line Model, specifically developed to capture the evolution of polarization impedance over time. This model offers a deeper understanding of the internal mechanisms driving battery aging, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of lithium-ion batteries. The research represents a significant contribution to the field, shedding light on the complex aging processes in lithium-ion batteries, particularly under the conditions of fast charging. This could lead to improved battery performance, longevity, and safety, which are critical for the wide range of applications that depend on these energy storage systems.</description>

Abstract: The attitude control of a spacecraft is integral to achieving mission success. However, failures in actuators such as reaction wheels are detrimental and can often lead to an early end of mission. We propose a Lyapunov-based adaptive controller that can estimate and compensate for reaction wheels degradation simultaneously. The controller incorporates an adaptive update control law with a gradient-based term and an integral concurrent learning term that collects input-output data for online estimation of uncertain parameters. The proposed controller guarantees attitude tracking and its performance is tested through numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-frequency spectral resolution with quantum sensors, while crucial in fields ranging from physical to biological sciences, is challenging due to their finite coherence time. Here, we introduce a novel protocol that achieves this goal by measuring phase correlations of AC magnetic fields using ensembles of NV centers. Our method extends the sensing dynamic range to frequencies higher than the system's Rabi frequency while achieving arbitrary frequency resolution, limited only by the target field coherence time. Moreover, our approach operates more robustly with respect to the magnetic field's amplitude. Thanks to this robustness, our protocol allows the application of more $\pi$-pulses in pulse sequences such as CPMG, enabling the decoupling of a broader range of frequency noise. The higher harmonics generated in this process continue to act as a part of the signal, ultimately improving the frequency resolution. This method paves the way for achieving arbitrary frequency resolution with improved performances, making it highly versatile for quantum sensing applications across diverse scientific fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibre-reinforced elastomers are lightweight and strong materials that can sustain large deformations. When filled with magnetic particles, their effective mechanical response can be modified by an external magnetic field. In the present study, we propose an effective theory of fibre-reinforced composite, based on a neo-Hookean elastic response and a linear magnetic law in each phase. The theory is shown suitable to describe the motion of composite cylinders. Furthermore, it is found appropriate for the modelling of fibre-reinforced composites subjected to a permanent magnetic field aligned with the fibres. To reach this result, we use the incremental theory ('small on large'), in combination with homogenisation theory and the Bloch-Floquet method. This way, we show that wave directivity is sensitive to the application of a permanent magnetic field, whereas the frequency range in which wave propagation is forbidden is not modified by such a load (the band gaps are invariant). In passing, we describe a method to deduce the total stress in the material based on the measurement of two wave speeds. Furthermore, we propose an effective energy function for the description of nonlinear composites made of Yeoh-type generalised neo-Hookean fibres within a neo-Hookean matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dispersive mode coupling is a promising mechanism for the development of advanced micro/nanoelectromechanical devices. However, strong coupling strength remains a key challenge limiting the practical applications of dispersive mode coupling effect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the significant tuning of the mode coupling coefficient of two flexural vibrational modes in a doubly-clamped MEMS beam resonator using thermally-induced buckling effect, which enables variable coupling strengths to be implemented for practical applications. Furthermore, a theoretical model is developed to describe the mode coupling coefficient, showing that the tunability is owing to the breakdown of the symmetric shape of the MEMS beam caused by buckling. Moreover, the theoretical model defines a simple relation between the coupling coefficient and the nonlinearity of the two coupled modes. These results provide valuable insight into physical mechanisms underlying dispersive mode coupling effect, as well as pave the way for the development of advanced MEMS devices with application-specified mode coupling strength.</description>

Abstract: Kernel methods map data into high-dimensional spaces, enabling linear algorithms to learn nonlinear functions without explicitly storing the feature vectors. Quantum kernel methods promise efficient learning by encoding feature maps into exponentially large Hilbert spaces inherent in quantum systems. In this work, we implement quantum kernels on a 10-qubit star-topology register in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. We experimentally encode classical data in the evolution of multiple quantum coherence orders using data-dependent unitary transformations and then demonstrate one-dimensional regression and two-dimensional classification tasks. By extending the register to a double-layered star configuration, we propose an extended quantum kernel to handle non-parametrized operator inputs. Specifically, we set up a kernel for the classification of entangling and non-entangling operations and then validate this kernel first numerically by computing it on a double-layered star register and then experimentally by computing it on a three-qubit NMR register. Our results show that this kernel exhibits an ability to generalize well over unseen data. These results confirm that quantum kernels possess strong capabilities in classical as well as quantum machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Design Wavelength Demultiplexer for On-Chip Photoluminescence Sorting in TMDC Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer a promising platform for on-chip integrated photonics because of their unique optical and electronic properties. Their naturally passivated surfaces make them highly tolerant to lattice mismatch, enabling seamless heterogeneous integration by stacking different van der Waals materials, a crucial step in the development of advanced photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate the use of an inverse design wavelength demultiplexing waveguides for on-chip sorting and routing of distinct photoluminescence from the heterojunction formed by WS2 and WSe2 monolayers. The integrated nanophotonic chip splits and sorts excitonic emission into individual waveguides at room temperature. Our demonstration opens up new perspectives for integrating light sources in van der Waals materials with functional integrated photonics, offering a versatile platform for both fundamental research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>DeepWheel: Generating a 3D Synthetic Wheel Dataset for Design and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven design is emerging as a powerful strategy to accelerate engineering innovation. However, its application to vehicle wheel design remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets that include 3D geometry and physical performance metrics. To address this gap, this study proposes a synthetic design-performance dataset generation framework using generative AI. The proposed framework first generates 2D rendered images using Stable Diffusion, and then reconstructs the 3D geometry through 2.5D depth estimation. Structural simulations are subsequently performed to extract engineering performance data. To further expand the design and performance space, topology optimization is applied, enabling the generation of a more diverse set of wheel designs. The final dataset, named DeepWheel, consists of over 6,000 photo-realistic images and 900 structurally analyzed 3D models. This multi-modal dataset serves as a valuable resource for surrogate model training, data-driven inverse design, and design space exploration. The proposed methodology is also applicable to other complex design domains.
