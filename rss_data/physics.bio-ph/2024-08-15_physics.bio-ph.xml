      <title>Self-folding Self-replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by protein folding, we explored the construction of three-dimensional structures and machines from one-dimensional chains of simple building blocks. This approach not only allows us to recreate the self-replication mechanism introduced earlier, but also significantly simplifies the process. We introduced a new set of folding blocks that facilitate the formation of secondary structures such as {\alpha}-helices and \b{eta}-sheets, as well as more advanced tertiary and quaternary structures, including self-replicating machines. The introduction of rotational degrees of freedom leads to a reduced variety of blocks and, most importantly, reduces the overall size of the machines by a factor of five. In addition, we present a universal copier-constructor, a highly efficient self-replicating mechanism composed of approximately 40 blocks, including the restictions posed on it. The paper also addresses evolutionary considerations, outlining several steps on the evolutionary ladder towards more sophisticated self-replicating systems. Finally, this study offers a clear rationale for nature's preference for one-dimensional chains in constructing three-dimensional structures.</description>

      <title>Enabling microrobotic chemotaxis via reset-free hierarchical reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms have evolved diverse strategies to propel in viscous fluids, navigate complex environments, and exhibit taxis in response to stimuli. This has inspired the development of synthetic microrobots, where machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role. Can ML endow these robots with intelligence resembling that developed by their natural counterparts over evolutionary timelines? Here, we demonstrate chemotactic navigation of a multi-link articulated microrobot using two-level hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL). The lower-level RL allows the robot -- featuring either a chain or ring topology -- to acquire topology-specific swimming gaits: wave propagation characteristic of flagella or body oscillation akin to an ameboid. Such flagellar and ameboid microswimmers, further enabled by the higher-level RL, accomplish chemotactic navigation in prototypical biologically-relevant scenarios that feature conflicting chemoattractants, pursuing a swimming bacterial mimic, steering in vortical flows, and squeezing through tight constrictions. Additionally, we achieve reset-free, partially observable RL, where the robot observes only its joint angles and local scalar quantities. This advancement illuminates solutions for overcoming the persistent challenges of manual resets and partial observability in real-world microrobotic RL.</description>

      <title>The mechanical properties of nerves, the size of the action potential, and consequences for the brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The action potential is widely considered a purely electrical phenomenon. However, one also finds mechanical and thermal changes that can be observed experimentally. In particular, nerve membranes become thicker and axons contract. The spatial length of the action potential can be quite large, ranging from millimeters to many centimeters. This suggests to employ macroscopic thermodynamics methods to understand its properties. The pulse length is several orders of magnitude larger than the synaptic gap, larger than the distance of the nodes of Ranvier, and even larger than the size of many neurons such as pyramidal cells or brain stem motor neurons. Here, we review the mechanical changes in nerves, theoretical possibilities to explain them, and implications of a mechanical nerve pulse for the neuron and for the brain. In particular, the contraction of nerves gives rise to the possibility of fast mechanical synapses.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Programmable Lipid Nanoparticles: A Comprehensive Review of the Four-Domain Model for Precision Drug Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent a critical advancement in drug delivery. It offers precise spatiotemporal control over drug distribution and release, which is essential for treating complex diseases such as cancer and genetic disorders. However, the design and understanding of these sophisticated systems necessitate a structured framework. This review introduces a novel Four-Domain Model - the Architecture, Interface, Payload, and Dispersal - providing a modular perspective that emphasizes the programmability of LNPs. We delve into the dynamics between LNPs components and their environment throughout their lifecycle, focusing on thermodynamic stability during synthesis, storage, delivery, and drug release. Through these four distinct but interconnected domains, we introduce the concept of input stimuli, functional components, and output responses. This modular approach offers new perspectives for the rational design of programmable nanocarriers for exquisite control over payload release while minimizing off-target effects. Advances in bioinspired design principles could lead to LNPs that mimic natural biological systems, enhancing their biocompatibility and functionality. This review summarizes recent advancements, identifies challenges, and offers outlooks for programmable LNPs, emphasizing their potential to evolve into more intelligent, naturally integrated systems that enhance scalability and reduce side effects. Additionally, exploring innovative anatomical routes such as intranasal and intraocular delivery holds significant promise for enhancing drug delivery efficacy and patient compliance, further expanding the clinical potential of programmable LNPs.</description>
