      <title>Bundle-extension inverse problems over elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a number of results to the general effect that, under obviously necessary numerical and determinant constraints, "most" morphisms between fixed bundles on a complex elliptic curve produce (co)kernels which can either be specified beforehand or else meet various rigidity constraints. Examples include: (a) for indecomposable $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{E'}$ with slopes and ranks increasing strictly in that order the space of monomorphisms whose cokernel is semistable and maximally rigid (i.e. has minimal-dimensional automorphism group) is open dense; (b) for indecomposable $\mathcal{K}$, $\mathcal{E}$ and stable $\mathcal{F}$ with slopes increasing strictly in that order and ranks and determinants satisfying the obvious additivity constraints the space of embeddings $\mathcal{K}\to \mathcal{E}$ whose cokernel is isomorphic to $\mathcal{F}$ is open dense; (c) the obvious mirror images of these results; (d) generalizations weakening indecomposability to semistability + maximal rigidity; (e) various examples illustrating the necessity of the assorted assumptions.</description>

      <title>A higher-order generalization of group theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show that fundamental concepts in higher-order Fourier analysis can be nauturally extended to the non-commutative setting. We generalize Gowers norms to arbitrary compact non-commutative groups. On the structural side, we show that nilspace theory (the algebraic part of higher-order Fourier analysis) can be naturally extended to include all non-commutative groups. To this end, we introduce generalized nilspaces called "groupspaces" and demonstrate that they possess properties very similar to nilspaces. We study $k$-th order generalizations of groups that are special groupspaces called {\it k-step} groupspaces. One step groupspaces are groups. We show that $k$-step groupspaces admit the structure of an iterated principal bundle with structure groups $G_1,G_2,\dots,G_k$. A similar, but somewhat more technical statement holds for general groupspaces, with possibly infinitely many structure groups. Structure groups of groupspaces are in some sense analogous to higher homotopy groups. In particular we use a version of the Eckmann-Hilton argument from homotopy theory to show that $G_i$ is abelian for $i\geq 2$. Groupspaces also show some similarities with $n$-groups from higher category theory (also used in physics) but the exact relationship between these concepts is a subject of future research.</description>

      <title>Dualities and Categorical Structures from 2D Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental step towards studying string theory vacua, and, ultimately, their stability, is that of understanding the underlying mathematical structure of the QFT resulting from its dimensional reduction on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds, the latter being complex manifolds admitting a category theory description. The present work aims at addressing this question in the case of lower-dimensional gravitating systems, and supersymmetric quiver gauge theories, highlighting the role played by dualities and categorical structures towards studying analytical structures of amplitudes. (Based on the author's PhD thesis.
