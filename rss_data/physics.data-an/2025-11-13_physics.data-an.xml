      <title>A surrogate-based approach to accelerate the design and build phases of reinforced concrete bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating uncertainties in the design process of reinforced concrete rail bridges, in a fully probabilistic framework, makes their design more complex and challenging. To propagate these uncertainties and convey their influence on the performance of the engineering system, a high-dimensional design space is supposed to be explored. A great challenge to be considered here lies in the computational burden as conducting such an exploration campaign requires substantial calls to computationally expensive finite element simulations. To address this challenge, a surrogate model mapping the design space to the reinforced concrete bridge performance functions is developed in the context of an active learning algorithm. The importance of this model lies in its ability to explore as many design scenarios as possible with minimal computational resources and classify the design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios. This work considers a 4-span reinforced concrete bridge deck. A multi-fiber finite element model of this beam is developed in Cast3m to generate the required design of experiments for the surrogate model. A performance comparison is undertaken to evaluate the Kriging surrogate model effectiveness with and without active learning while the reliability of Kriging predictions is also assessed in comparison to PC-Kriging.</description>

      <title>GAMMA_FLOW: Guided Analysis of Multi-label spectra by MAtrix Factorization for Lightweight Operational Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GAMMA_FLOW is an open-source Python package for real-time analysis of spectral data. It supports classification, denoising, decomposition, and outlier detection of both single- and multi-component spectra. Instead of relying on large, computationally intensive models, it employs a supervised approach to non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for dimensionality reduction. This ensures a fast, efficient, and adaptable analysis while reducing computational costs. gamma_flow achieves classification accuracies above 90% and enables reliable automated spectral interpretation. Originally developed for gamma-ray spectra, it is applicable to any type of one-dimensional spectral data. As an open and flexible alternative to proprietary software, it supports various applications in research and industry.</description>

      <title>A simple tool for weighted averaging of inconsistent data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted average of inconsistent data is a common and tedious problem that many scientists have encountered. The standard weighted average is not recommended for these cases, and various alternative methods have been proposed. These approaches vary in suitability depending on the nature of the data, which can make selecting the appropriate method difficult without expertise in metrology or statistics. For the analysis of simple data sets presenting inconsistencies, we discuss the method proposed by Sivia in 1996 based on Bayesian statistics. This choice has the intention of maintaining generality while minimising the number of assumptions. In this approach, the uncertainty associated with each input value is considered to be just a lower bound of the true unknown uncertainty. The resulting likelihood function is no longer Gaussian but has smoothly decreasing wings, which allows for a better treatment of scattered data and outliers. To demonstrate the robustness and the generality of the method, we apply it to a series of critical data sets: simulations, CODATA recommended values of the Newtonian gravitational constant, and some particle properties from the Particle Data Group, including the proton charge radius. A freely available Python library is also provided for a simple implementation of the proposed averaging method.</description>

      <title>Nature-inspired optimization, the Philippine Eagle, and cosmological parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise and accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is crucial for understanding the Universe's dynamics and addressing cosmological tensions. In this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided. Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes, but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter spaces and validate standard results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian network 3D event reconstruction in the Cygno optical TPC for dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CYGNO experiment is developing a high-resolution gaseous Time Projection Chamber with optical readout for directional dark matter searches. The detector uses a helium-tetrafluoromethane (He:CF$_4$ 60:40) gas mixture at atmospheric pressure and a triple Gas Electron Multiplier amplification stage, coupled with a scientific camera for high-resolution 2D imaging and fast photomultipliers for time-resolved scintillation light detection. This setup enables 3D event reconstruction: photomultipliers signals provide depth information, while the camera delivers high-precision transverse resolution. In this work, we present a Bayesian Network-based algorithm designed to reconstruct the events using only the photomultipliers signals, yielding a full 3D description of the particle trajectories. The algorithm models the light collection process probabilistically and estimates spatial and intensity parameters on the Gas Electron Multiplier plane, where light emission occurs. It is implemented within the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling for posterior inference. Validation using data from the CYGNO LIME prototype shows accurate reconstruction of localized and extended tracks. Results demonstrate that the Bayesian approach enables robust 3D description and, when combined with camera data, further improves the precision of track reconstruction. This methodology represents a significant step forward in directional dark matter detection, enhancing the identification of nuclear recoil tracks with high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Geometric Features of Higher-Order Networks via the Spectral Triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.</description>
