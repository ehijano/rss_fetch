      <title>Generating Reservoir State Descriptions with Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computer measurements through the use of a simple quantum system and random matrices to motivate how atomic-scale devices might be used for real-world computing applications. In our approach, random matrices are used to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means for producing state descriptions. In our studies, systems as simple as a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain are used to perform several tasks, including time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique as well as their current limitations are discussed in detail alongside an exploration of the diversity of measurements yielded by the random matrices. Additionally, we explore the role of the parameters of the spin chain, adjusting coupling strength and the measurement dimension, yielding insights into how these learning machines might be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use of random matrices as measurements of simple quantum systems for natural learning devices and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realisation.</description>

      <title>1-bit Quantized On-chip Hybrid Diffraction Neural Network Enabled by Authentic All-optical Fully-connected Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Diffraction Neural Networks (DNNs), a subset of Optical Neural Networks (ONNs), show promise in mirroring the prowess of electronic networks. This study introduces the Hybrid Diffraction Neural Network (HDNN), a novel architecture that incorporates matrix multiplication into DNNs, synergizing the benefits of conventional ONNs with those of DNNs to surmount the modulation limitations inherent in optical diffraction neural networks. Utilizing a singular phase modulation layer and an amplitude modulation layer, the trained neural network demonstrated remarkable accuracies of 96.39% and 89% in digit recognition tasks in simulation and experiment, respectively. Additionally, we develop the Binning Design (BD) method, which effectively mitigates the constraints imposed by sampling intervals on diffraction units, substantially streamlining experimental procedures. Furthermore, we propose an on-chip HDNN that not only employs a beam-splitting phase modulation layer for enhanced integration level but also significantly relaxes device fabrication requirements, replacing metasurfaces with relief surfaces designed by 1-bit quantization. Besides, we conceptualized an all-optical HDNN-assisted lesion detection network, achieving detection outcomes that were 100% aligned with simulation predictions. This work not only advances the performance of DNNs but also streamlines the path towards industrial optical neural network production.</description>

      <title>IITP-VDLand: A Comprehensive Dataset on Decentraland Parcels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents IITP-VDLand, a comprehensive dataset of Decentraland parcels sourced from diverse platforms. Unlike existing datasets which have limited attributes and records, IITP-VDLand offers a rich array of attributes, encompassing parcel characteristics, trading history, past activities, transactions, and social media interactions. Alongside, we introduce a key attribute in the dataset, namely Rarity score, which measures the uniqueness of each parcel within the virtual world. Addressing the significant challenge posed by the dispersed nature of this data across various sources, we employ a systematic approach, utilizing both available APIs and custom scripts, to gather it. Subsequently, we meticulously curate and organize the information into four distinct segments: (1) Characteristics Data-Fragment, (2) OpenSea Trading History Data-Fragment, (3) Ethereum Activity Transactions Data-Fragment, and (4) Social Media Data-Fragment. We envisage that this dataset would serve as a robust resource for training machine- and deep-learning models specifically designed to address real-world challenges within the domain of Decentraland parcels. The performance benchmarking of more than 20 state-of-the-art price prediction models on our dataset yields promising results, achieving a maximum R2 score of 0.8251 and an accuracy of 74.23% in case of Extra Trees Regressor and Classifier. The key findings reveal that the ensemble models performs better than both deep learning and linear models for our dataset. We observe a significant impact of coordinates, geographical proximity, rarity score, and few other economic indicators on the prediction of parcel prices.</description>

      <title>On Naisargik Images of Varshamov-Tenengolts and Helberg Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VT and Helberg codes, both in binary and non-binary forms, stand as elegant solutions for rectifying insertion and deletion errors. In this paper we consider the quaternary versions of these codes. It is well known that many optimal binary non-linear codes like Kerdock and Prepreta can be depicted as Gray images (isometry) of codes defined over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. Thus a natural question arises: Can we find similar maps between quaternary and binary spaces which gives interesting properties when applied to the VT and Helberg codes. We found several such maps called Naisargik (natural) maps and we study the images of quaternary VT and Helberg codes under these maps. Naisargik and inverse Naisargik images gives interesting error-correcting properties for VT and Helberg codes. If two Naisargik images of VT code generates an intersecting one deletion sphere, then the images holds the same weights. A quaternary Helberg code designed to correct $s$ deletions can effectively rectify $s+1$ deletion errors when considering its Naisargik image, and $s$-deletion correcting binary Helberg code can corrects $\lfloor\frac{s}{2}\rfloor$ errors with inverse Naisargik image.</description>

      <title>Optical next generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks with dynamics exhibit remarkable capability in processing information. Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises the physical openness, posing challenges for neuromorphic realizations. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with large-scale computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delay inputs. We show that, much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and high-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, fewer hyperparameters and increased interpretability compared to conventional optical RC, while achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Given its scalability and versatility, the optical NGRC framework also paves the way for next generation physical RC, new applications and architectures in a broad sense.</description>

      <title>Defining Quantum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we survey the existing quantum physics related games and based on them propose a definition for the concept of quantum games. We define quantum games as any type of rule-based games that use the principles or reference the theory of quantum physics or quantum phenomena through any of three proposed dimensions: the perceivable dimension of quantum physics, the dimension of quantum technologies, and the dimension of scientific purposes like citizen science or education. We also discuss the concept of quantum computer games, games on quantum computers and discuss the definitions for the concept of science games. At the same time, there are various games exploring quantum physics and quantum computing through digital, analogue, and hybrid means with diverse incentives driving their development. As interest in games as educational tools for supporting quantum literacy grows, understanding the diverse landscape of quantum games becomes increasingly important. We propose that three dimensions of quantum games identified in this article are used for designing, analysing and defining the phenomenon of quantum games.</description>

      <title>RIShield: Enabling Electromagnetic Blackout in Radiation-Sensitive Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a disruptive technology with the potential to revolutionize wireless communication systems. In this paper, we present RIShield, a novel application of RIS technology specifically designed for radiation-sensitive environments. The aim of RIShield is to enable electromagnetic blackouts, preventing radiation leakage from target areas. We propose a comprehensive framework for RIShield deployment, considering the unique challenges and requirements of radiation-sensitive environments. By strategically positioning RIS panels, we create an intelligent shielding mechanism that selectively absorbs and reflects electromagnetic waves, effectively blocking radiation transmission. To achieve optimal performance, we model the corresponding channel and design a dynamic control that adjusts the RIS configuration based on real-time radiation monitoring. By leveraging the principles of reconfiguration and intelligent control, RIShield ensures adaptive and efficient protection while minimizing signal degradation. Through full-wave and ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RIShield in achieving significant electromagnetic attenuation. Our results highlight the potential of RIS technology to address critical concerns in radiation-sensitive environments, paving the way for safer and more secure operations in industries such as healthcare, nuclear facilities, and defense.</description>

      <title>A two-circuit approach to reducing quantum resources for the quantum lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient at the appropriate computation. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems use a single quantum circuit and, in some cases, lattice-based methods. We introduce the a novel multiple circuits algorithm that makes use of a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM). The two-circuit algorithm we form solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a marked reduction in CNOT gates compared to existing QLBM circuits. The problem is cast as a stream function--vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and verified and tested on a 2D lid-driven cavity flow. We show that using separate circuits for the stream function and vorticity lead to a marked CNOT reduction: 35% in total CNOT count and 16% in combined gate depth. This strategy has the additional benefit of the circuits being able to run concurrently, further halving the seen gate depth. This work is intended as a step towards practical quantum circuits for solving differential equation-based problems of scientific interest.</description>
