      <title>On generalized arcsine laws and residual allocation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on their earlier studies of the arcsine law, Pitman and Yor in \cite{PY97} constructed a widely adopted PD($\alpha, \theta)$ family of random mass-partitions with parameters $\alpha \in [0,1),\ \theta+\alpha&gt;0$. We propose an alternative model based on generalized perpetuities, which extends the PD family in a continuous manner, incorporating any $\alpha\geq 0$. This perspective yields a new, concise proof for the stick-breaking (or residual allocation) representations of PD distributions, recovering the classical results of McCloskey and Perman in particular. We apply this framework to provide a constructive and intuitive proof of Pitman and Yor's generalized arcsine law concerning the partitions arising from $\alpha$-stable subordinators for $\alpha \in (0,1)$. The result shows that the random partitions generated by stable subordinators have identical distributions when observed over temporal or spatial intervals. This theorem has a number of significant implications for excursion theory. As a corollary, using purely probabilistic arguments, we obtain general arcsine laws for excursions of $d$-dimensional Bessel process for $0&lt;d&lt;2$, and Brownian motion in particular.</description>

      <title>Random walks in space-time random media in all spatial dimensions: the full subcritical fluctuation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arbitrary spatial dimension $d\ge 1$, we study a generalized model of random walks in a time-varying random environment (RWRE) defined by a stochastic flow of kernels. We consider the quenched probability distribution of the random walker under a scaling where the time is of order $N$ and the spatial window is of size $N^{1/2}$. This spatial window may not necessarily be centered close to the origin.
  We show that as $N\to \infty$ there are Gaussian fluctuations up to a certain specific spatial centering radius $\psi_N$ in the tail of the quenched probability distribution, which we call the critical scale. This critical scale depends on the spatial dimension of the underlying random walk, specifically $\psi_N = O(N^{3/4})$ when $d=1$, $\psi_N = O( N/\sqrt{\log N})$ when $d=2$, and $\psi_N = O(N)$ when $d\ge 3$. In the particular case of centering the fluctuation window at the origin, our results recover and generalize some known fluctuation results for related models. However, farther from the origin, the previous literature is more sparse. The noise coefficient in the limiting Gaussian field is nontrivial and depends on the invariant measure of the two-point motion of the underlying RWRE model. We furthermore reconcile some of these coefficient formulas with previous works.
  As part of the proof, we introduce a general class of Markov chains with short-range interactions that admit nice estimates and limit formulas. One of the key technical results for such Markov chains is that in $d\ge 2$, one can propagate test functions backwards in time to obtain precise limiting moment formulas.</description>

      <title>The real layering field of Brownian loop soup and the Gaussian multiplicative chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the random field defined by the layering numbers of the Brownian loop soup in a bounded simply connected domain in the complex plane. We call this the layering field and show that, after a suitable renormalization, it converges to the subcritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos. The main technique for our proof is the Wiener-It\^{o} chaos expansion. We also calculate the $n$-point functions of the layering field, show their conformal covariance and discuss their behavior near the boundary of the domain.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for slow-fast systems of PDEs with rough drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of slow--fast systems of rough partial differential equations defined over a monotone family of interpolation Hilbert spaces. By employing the controlled rough path framework tailored to a monotone family of interpolation spaces, together with a time discretization argument, we demonstrate that the slow component strongly converges to the solution of the averaged system in the supremum norm as the time-scale parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to $0$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volterra equations: failure of the time-homogeneous Markov property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path-dependence is a defining feature of many real-world systems, with applications ranging from population dynamics to rough volatility models and electricity spot prices. In stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs), such dependence is encoded in the Volterra kernel, which dictates how past trajectories influence present dynamics on infinitesimal time scales. This structure suggests a breakdown of the Markov property. In this article, we develop computational techniques and methods based on small-time asymptotics for SVEs with H\"older coefficients to rigorously establish that they cannot possess the time-homogeneous Markov property. In particular, for affine drifts, we prove that the time-homogeneous Markov property only holds in the case of the exponential Volterra kernel $K(t) = c e^{-\lambda t}$, where the parameter $\lambda$ is linked to the initial curve of the SVE.</description>

      <title>Marginal dynamics of probabilistic cellular automata on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study locally interacting processes in discrete time, often called probabilistic cellular automata, indexed by locally finite graphs. For infinite regular trees and certain generalized Galton-Watson trees, we show that the marginal evolution at a single vertex and its neighborhood can be characterized by an autonomous stochastic recursion referred to as the local-field equation. This evolution can be viewed as a nonlinear or measure-dependent chain, but the measure dependence arises from the symmetries of the underlying tree rather than from any mean field interactions. We discuss applications to simulation of marginal dynamics and approximations of empirical measures of interacting chains on several generic classes of large-scale finite graphs that are locally tree-like. In addition to the symmetries of the tree, a key role is played by a second-order Markov random field property, which we establish for general graphs along with some other novel Gibbs measure properties.</description>

      <title>Random Walks on $\mathbb{Z}_q^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies long range random walks on ${\mathbb{Z}_q}^d$. $X_{t+1} = X_t + Z_t \mod q$, with $(Z_t)$ independent and identically distributed. Multiple entries of $Z_t$ can be non-zero in a transition. An emphasis is on finding the structure of such random walks and spectral expansions for the transition functions. Circulant transition probability matrices are important in this study. Processes are extended to processes on the torus $[0,1]$, scaling entries in $\{0,1,\ldots, q-1\}$ by dividing by $q$ and letting $q \to \infty$. If the entries of $X_t$ are exchangeable then a grouping of $X_t$ is made by taking counts of the types $0,\ldots, q-1$ in $X_t$. In this grouping the multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials become the eigenvectors. Examples consider cutoff times and mixing times in these processes. A limit form for the multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials is used to find a central limit theorem for the transition distributions in the grouped model as $d \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations in mean field stable matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two sets of objects of size $n$ are to be matched to each other based on i.i.d. costs associated to every pair of objects. Objects prefer to be matched as cheaply as possible, and a matching is said to be stable if there is no pair of objects that would prefer to match to each other rather than to their current partners. Properties of such matchings are analysed for cost distributions with a density $\rho$ satisfying $\rho(x)/(dx^{d-1})\to 1$ as $x\to 0^+$, where the number $d$ is known as the pseudo-dimension. For $d&gt;0$, the typical matching cost is shown to be of order $n^{-1/d}$, with an explicit distributional limit. For $d&gt;1$ the total matching cost is shown to be of order $n^{1-1/d}$, and to obey a law of large numbers. For $d&gt;2$ the fluctuations of the total matching cost are shown to be of order $n^{1/2-1/d}$, and to obey a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>A Free Probabilistic Framework for Denoising Diffusion Models: Entropy, Transport, and Reverse Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a rigorous framework for diffusion-based generative modeling in the setting of free probability. We extend classical denoising diffusion probabilistic models to free diffusion processes -- stochastic dynamics acting on noncommutative random variables whose spectral measures evolve by free additive convolution. The forward dynamics satisfy a free Fokker--Planck equation that increases Voiculescu's free entropy and dissipates free Fisher information, providing a noncommutative analogue of the classical de Bruijn identity. Using tools from free stochastic analysis, including a free Malliavin calculus and a Clark--Ocone representation, we derive the reverse-time stochastic differential equation driven by the conjugate variable, the free analogue of the score function. We further develop a variational formulation of these flows in the free Wasserstein space, showing that the resulting gradient-flow structure converges to the semicircular equilibrium law. Together, these results connect modern diffusion models with the information geometry of free entropy and establish a mathematical foundation for generative modeling with operator-valued or high-dimensional structured data.</description>

      <title>Universality of Cutoff for Riffle Shuffling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds (GSR) shuffle is performed on a deck of $N$ cards by cutting the top $n\sim Bin(N,1/2)$ cards and interleaving the two resulting piles uniformly at random. The celebrated "Seven shuffles suffice" theorem of [Bayer-Diaconis '92] established cutoff for this Markov chain: to leading order, total variation mixing occurs after precisely $\frac{3}{2}\log_2 N$ shuffles. Later work of [Lalley '00] and [Sellke '22] extended this result to asymmetric binomial cuts $n\sim Bin(N,p)$ for all $p\in (0,1)$. These results relied heavily on the binomial condition and many natural chains were left open, including uniformly random cuts and exact bisections.
  We establish cutoff for riffle shuffles with general pile size distribution. Namely, suppose the cut sizes $(n^{(t)})_{t\geq 1}$ are IID and the convergence in distribution $n^{(t)}/N \stackrel{d}{\to} \mu$ holds for some probability measure $\mu$ on the interval $[0,1]$. Then the mixing time $t_{mix}$ satisfies $t_{mix}/\log N\to \overline{C}_{\mu}$ for an explicit constant $\overline{C}_{\mu}$. The same result holds for any (deterministic or random) sequence of pile sizes with empirical distribution converging to $\mu$ on all macroscopic time intervals (of length $\Omega(\log N)$). It also extends to multi-partite shuffles where the deck is cut into more than $2$ piles in each step. Qualitatively, we find that the "cold spot" phenomenon identified by [Lalley '00] characterizes the mixing time of riffle shuffling in great generality.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{U}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills in the 't Hooft regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a mass gap, prove the existence of a unique infinite volume limit, and give a new proof of the large $N$ limit for $\mathrm{U}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory in the 't Hooft regime. These results were previously obtained for $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills theories as applications of the mixing of the associated Langevin dynamics, which is verified via the Bakry-\'Emery criterion [SZZ23]. For $\mathrm{U}(N)$, however, this approach fails because its Ricci curvature is not uniformly positive, and as a result the Bakry-\'Emery condition cannot be easily verified. To overcome this obstacle, we recast the $\mathrm{U}(N)$ theory as a random-environment $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ model, where the randomness arises from a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ field, and combine cluster-expansion and Langevin-dynamics techniques to analyze the resulting $\mathrm{U}(1)\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$ model.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for decoupled renewal processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decoupled standard random walk is a sequence of independent random variables $(\hat S_n)_{n\geq 1}$, in which $\hat S_n$ has the same distribution as the position at time $n$ of a standard random walk with nonnegative jumps. Denote by $\hat N(t)$ the number of elements of the decoupled standard random walk which do not exceed $t$. The random process $(\hat N(t))_{t\geq 0}$ is called decoupled renewal process. Under the assumption that $t\mapsto \mathbb{P}\{\hat S_1&gt;t\}$ is regularly varying at infinity of nonpositive index larger than $-1$ we prove a functional central limit theorem in the Skorokhod space equipped with the $J_1$-topology for the decoupled renewal processes, properly scaled, centered and normalized. Also, under the assumption that $t\mapsto \mathbb{P}\{\hat S_1&gt;t\}$ is regularly varying at infinity of index $-\alpha$, $\alpha\in [0,1)\cup (1,2)$ or the distribution of $\hat S_1$ belongs to the domain of attraction of a normal distribution we prove a law of the iterated or single logarithm for $\hat N(t)$, again properly normalized and centered. As an application, we obtain a law of the single logarithm for the number of atoms of a determinantal point process with the Mittag-Leffler kernel, which lie in expanding discs.</description>

      <title>Type II success runs of Bernoulli trials separated by a gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We treat success runs of independent identically distributed Bernoulli trials (with success parameter $p$) distributed according to the Type II binomial distribution of order $k$. However, the success runs are separated by a gap $g\ge1$ (a failure followed by $g-1$ arbitrary outcomes). Most of the literature treats the case $g=1$ only. Our main results are expressions for the probability mass function (we present two derivations) and the distribution of the longest success run. We also present more concise expressions for previously published results for the factorial moments. Finally, we present results for the mean, variance, probability mass function and factorial moments for $\textrm{NB}_{\rm II}(k,g,r)$, the Type II negative binomial distribution of order $k$, where the number of success runs $r$ is fixed and the number of trials $n$ is variable.</description>

      <title>Exotic B-series representation of the Feller semigroup for It\^o diffusions and the MSR path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the expansion of the Feller semigroup of a one-dimensional It\^o diffusion as a power series in time. Taking our moves from previous results on expansions labelled by exotic trees, we derive an explicit expression for the combinatorial factors involved, that leads to an exotic Butcher series representation. A key step is the extension of the notion of tree factorial and Connes-Moscovici weight to this richer family of rooted trees. The ensuing expression is suitable for a comparison with the perturbative path integral construction of the statistics of the diffusion, known in the literature as Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism. Resorting to multi-indices to represent pre-Feynman diagrams, we show that the latter coincides with the exotic B-series representation of the semigroup, giving it a solid mathematical foundation.</description>

      <title>Hidden regular variation for stochastic recursions with diagonal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random vectors $X$ that satisfy the equation in law $X=AX+B$, where $A$ is a given random diagonal matrix and $B$ a given random vector, both independent of $X$. It is well known by the works of Kesten and Goldie that the marginals of $X$ may exhibit heavy tails, with possibly different tail indices.
  In recent works (Damek 2025, Mentemeier and Wintenberger 2022) it was observed that asymptotic independence may occur despite strong dependencies in the entries of $A$: The probability that both marginals are simultaneously large decays faster than the marginal probability of an extreme event; the tail measure is concentrated on the axis. In this work, we analyse the hidden regular variation properties of $X$, that is, we find the proper scaling for which one observes simultaneous extremes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Malliavin calculus for nonlinear Hawkes processes in the sense of Carlen and Pardoux. This approach, based on perturbations of the jump times of the process, enables the construction of a local Dirichlet form. As an application, we establish criteria for the absolute continuity of solutions to stochastic differential equations driven by Hawkes processes. We also derive sensitivity formulas for the valuation of financial derivatives with respect to model parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a labeled variant of the classical Coupon Collector Problem (CCP), recently introduced by Tan et al., where coupons arrive in groups and only the set of labels is revealed. The goal is to determine the expected number of group drawings required to uniquely identify the labeling of all coupons. We focus on the case where groups consist of pairs ($k=2$), and provide rigorous proofs for two conjectures posed by Tan et al.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Proof of Conditional Limit Theorem for Critical Galton--Waston Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{Z_{n}\}_{n\geq0}$ be a critical Galton--Waston branching process with finite variance $\sigma^{2}$. Spitzer (unpublished), Lamperti and Ney (1968) proved that for any fixed $0&lt;t&lt;1$, $$\mathscr{L}\left(\frac{Z_{nt}}{n}\Big|Z_{n}&gt;0\right)\overset{\text{d}}{\rightarrow}U_{t}+V_{t}$$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, where $U_{t}$ and $V_{t}$ are independent random variables having exponential distributions with parameters $2/(t(1-t)\sigma^{2})$ and $2/(t\sigma^{2})$ respectively. The proof is short and elegent based on the Laplace transform.
  In this paper, we will specify where the two exponential random variables come from explicitly, in terms of the Geiger's conditioned tree. Actually, $U_{t}$ and $V_{t}$ are resulted from the ``left'' and ``right'' parts of the ``spine'' of the Geiger's tree at generation $[nt]$. To this end, more details and intrinsic properties about the Geiger's conditioned tree will be investigated, which are interesting in its own right as well.</description>

      <title>Stochastic fractional evolution equations of order $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$ with generalized operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for stochastic fractional evolution equations with Caputo time fractional derivative of order $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$ and space variable coefficients on an unbounded domain. The space derivatives that appear in the equations are of integer or fractional order such as the left and the right Liouville fractional derivative as well as the Riesz fractional derivative. To solve the problem we use generalized uniformly continuous solution operators. We obtain the unique solution within a certain Colombeau generalized stochastic process space. In our solving procedure, instead of the originate problem we solve a certain approximate problem, where operators of the original and the approximate problem are $L^2$-associated. Finally, application of the theory in solving stochastic time and time-space fractional wave equation is shown.</description>

      <title>Expected Length of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree and 1-norms of Chromatic Persistence Diagrams in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $c$ be the constant such that the expected length of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of $n$ random points in the unit square is $c \sqrt{n}$ in the limit, when $n$ goes to infinity. We improve the prior best lower bound of $0.6008 \leq c$ by Avram and Bertsimas to $0.6289 \leq c$. The proof is a by-product of studying the persistent homology of randomly $2$-colored point sets. Specifically, we consider the filtration induced by the inclusions of the two mono-chromatic sublevel sets of the Euclidean distance function into the bi-chromatic sublevel set of that function. Assigning colors randomly, and with equal probability, we show that the expected $1$-norm of each chromatic persistence diagram is a constant times $\sqrt{n}$ in the limit, and we determine the constant in terms of $c$ and another constant, $c_L$, which arises for a novel type of Euclidean minimum spanning tree of $2$-colored point sets.</description>

      <title>One-arm exponents of the high-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability that the origin is connected to the boundary of the box of size $n$ (the one-arm probability) in several percolation models related to the Ising model. We prove that different universality classes emerge at criticality.
  - For the FK-Ising measure in a box of size $n$ with wired boundary conditions, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n$ in dimensions $d&gt;4$, and as $1/n^{1+o(1)}$ when $d=4$.
  - For the infinite volume FK-Ising measure, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n^2$ in dimensions $d&gt;6$, and as $1/n^{2+o(1)}$ when $d=6$.
  - For the sourceless double random current measure, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n^{d-2}$ in dimensions $d&gt;4$.
  Additionally, for the infinite volume FK-Ising measure, we show that the one-arm probability is $1/n^{1+o(1)}$ in dimension $d=4$, and at least $1/n^{3/2}$ in dimension $d=5$. This establishes that the FK-Ising model has upper-critical dimension equal to $6$, in contrast to the Ising model, where it is known to be less or equal to $4$, thus solving a conjecture of Chayes, Coniglio, Machta, and Schtengel.</description>

      <title>On the Martin boundary for discrete TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The net of N ``physical'' neurons is considered as a dynamical system. These neurons form a complete graph. The state of any neuron is its electric potential. The potential linearly increases until reaches its maximal value. Then it falls to zero and the neuron sends spikes to all other neurons. Having got a spike any neuron changes its state by some given function. We study the problem of a synchronization of the net. We glue the maximal value of potential to zero and so consider the state of any neuron as a point on the circle. We prove that under some conditions the states of neurons considered as points on the circle finally (when time turns to infinity) form a set which is time-invariant modulo its uniform rotation along the circle.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Graph Ensemble Embeddings for Aptamer Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity, producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Two-HCIZ Gaussian Matrix Model for Non-intersecting Brownian Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a one-matrix model for non-intersecting Brownian bridges with multiple starts and ends: it is a Gaussian Hermitian ensemble 'dressed' by two Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber (HCIZ) integrals encoding the boundary data. We prove that, at finite $n$ (including confluent multiplicities), its eigenvalue law coincides with the Karlin-McGregor distribution. A structural "single-HCIZ collapse" of the partition function, with an explicit $t$-dependent prefactor, identifies it as a $2$D-Toda $\tau$-function in Miwa variables and leads to Virasoro constraints via Schwinger-Dyson equations. In the reduction $(p,q)=(2,1)$, the model matches the external-field ensemble spectrally while exhibiting distinct angular statistics (Haar-distributed eigenvectors). These results provide the matrix-integral origin for the mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomial/Riemann-Hilbert description and enable direct finite-$n$ identities and large-$n$ asymptotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of degenerate diffusion generators that arise in sequential testing and quickest detection problems with partial information. The observation process is driven by $k$ independent Brownian motions, while the hidden state takes $n+1$ values with $k&lt;n$. By moving to the posterior likelihood coordinates, we analyze the H\"omander's condition of the operator both without state switching (testing) and with switching (detection). We characterize the cases where the operator is hypoelliptic for the former, give two different sufficient conditions for the latter, and discuss their consequences.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Error of Large Language Models at Pairwise Text Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar, close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.</description>

      <title>Talagrand-Type Correlation Inequalities for Supermodular and Submodular Functions on the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Talagrand initiated a quantitative program by lower-bounding the correlation of any two increasing Boolean functions in terms of their influences, thereby capturing how strongly the functions depend on the exact coordinates. We strengthen this line of results by proving Talagrand-type correlation lower bounds that hold whenever the increasing functions additionally satisfy super/submodularity. In particular, under super/submodularity, we establish the ``dream inequality'' $$\mathbb{E}[fg]-\mathbb{E}[f]\mathbb{E}[g]\ge \frac{1}{4}\cdot\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\mathrm{Inf}_i[f]\mathrm{Inf}_i[g].$$ Thereby confirming a conjectural direction suggested by Kalai--Keller--Mossel. Our results also clarify the connection to the antipodal strengthening considered by Friedgut, Kahn, Kalai, and Keller, who showed that a famous Chv\'atal's conjecture is equivalent to a certain reinforcement of Talagrand-type correlation inequality when one function is antipodal. Thus, our inequality verifies the Friedgut--Kahn--Kalai--Keller conjectural bound in this structured regime (super/submodular). Our approach uses two complementary methods: (1) a semigroup proof based on a new heat-semigroup representation via second-order discrete derivatives, and (2) an induction proof that avoids semigroup argument entirely.</description>

Abstract: We revisit a classical calculus computation: the centroid of the subgraph of a function on the interval from 0 to a, and show that it hides a rigidity theorem. Let f be twice continuously differentiable on (0, infinity), take values in (0, infinity), and satisfy f(0+) = 0. Define xbar(a) as (integral from 0 to a of x f(x) dx) divided by (integral from 0 to a of f(x) dx), and define ybar(a) as (1/2) times (integral from 0 to a of f(x)^2 dx) divided by (integral from 0 to a of f(x) dx). We prove that the Geometric Scaling Property, namely the identity ybar(a) = lambda * f(xbar(a)) for every a &gt; 0, holds if and only if f(x) = A * x^p with A &gt; 0 and p &gt; 0. For these power laws the optimal constant is lambda = (p+1)/(2(2p+1)) * ((p+2)/(p+1))^p. After a scale-free normalization, the proof is probabilistic: with the self-generated probability measure on (0, a) having density proportional to f, we have xbar(a) equal to the expected value of Xa and ybar(a) equal to (1/2) times the expected value of f(Xa), so the Geometric Scaling Property becomes an equality in expectation across all truncation scales. Differentiating with respect to a yields a weighted mean identity for the elasticity E(x) = x f'(x) / f(x); a second differentiation forces a vanishing variance principle that makes E constant, hence f a pure power, and the stated value of lambda follows. The argument uses no asymptotics and extends to f that is once continuously differentiable on (0, infinity) with locally Lipschitz elasticity.</description>

      <title>Stopping Rules for Monte Carlo Methods of Martingale Difference Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a practical and easy-to-implement sequential stopping rule for the martingale central limit theorem, focusing on Monte Carlo methods for estimating the mean of a non-iid sequence of martingale difference type. Starting with an impractical scheme based on the standard martingale central limit theorem, we progressively address its limitations from implementation perspectives in the non-asymptotic regime. Along the way, we compare the proposed schemes with their counterparts in the asymptotic regime. The developed framework has potential applications in various domains, including stochastic gradient descent methods. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed stopping rules in terms of reliability and complexity.</description>

      <title>Effective Erd\H{o}s-Wintner for Cantor series via a trailing-window method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove explicit Erd\H{o}s--Wintner bounds for Cantor series via a simple trailing-window decomposition. We temporarily discard the last block of digits (the ``window'') and analyze the remaining prefix. The resulting bound has three contributions: (i) a bridge loss from discarding the window; (ii) a variance-type tail for the prefix; and (iii) a regime-dependent smoothing term (Esseen, bounded density, or cancellation of the third cumulant). Optimizing the window length yields rates that are explicit in the sample size. In the fixed-base (q-adic) case we recover Delange's product and obtain effective convergence bounds; the same scheme applies unchanged to Cantor series. We also include a brief guide indicating when each regime is preferable.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the limit set of non-autonomous IFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractals are ubiquitous in nature, and since Mandelbrot's seminal insight into their structure, there has been growing interest in them. While the topological properties of the limit sets of IFSs have been studied -- notably in the pioneering work of Hata -- many aspects remain poorly understood, especially in the non-autonomous setting. In this paper, we present a homological framework which captures the structure of the limit set. We apply our novel abstract theory to the concrete analysis of the so-called fractal square, and provide an answer to a variant of Mandelbrot's percolation problem. This work offers new insights into the topology of fractals.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series studying the global asymptotics of discrete $N$-particle systems with inverse temperature parameter $\theta$ in the high temperature regime. In the first paper, we established necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers at high temperature in terms of Jack generating functions. In this paper, we derive a functional equation for the moment generating function of the limiting measure, which enables its analysis using analytic tools. We apply this functional equation to compute the densities of the high temperature limits of the pure Jack measures. As a special case, we obtain the high temperature limit of the large fixed-time distribution of the discrete-space $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion of Gorin-Shkolnikov. Two special cases of our densities are the high temperature limits of discrete versions of the G$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Guionnet in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 (2012), 094102; arXiv:1205.3598], and L$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Majumdar-Vivo in [J. Phys. A, vol. 46, no. 1 (2013), 015001; arXiv:1209.6171]. Moreover, we prove the following crystallization phenomenon of the particles in the high temperature limit: the limiting measures are uniformly supported on disjoint intervals with unit gaps and their locations correspond to the zeros of explicit special functions with all roots located in the real line. We also show that these zeros correspond to the spectra of certain unbounded Jacobi operators.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein Duality beyond Hausdorff and Kantorovich</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality guarantees coincidence between metrics on the space of probability distributions defined on the one hand via transport plans (couplings) and on the other hand via price functions. Both constructions have been lifted to the level of generality of set functors, with the coupling-based construction referred to as the Wasserstein lifting, and the price-function-based construction as the Kantorovich lifting, both based on a choice of quantitative modalities for the given functor. It is known that every Wasserstein lifting can be expressed as a Kantorovich lifting; however, the latter in general needs to use additional modalities. We give an example showing that this cannot be avoided in general. We refer to cases in which the same modalities can be used as satisfying the generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality. We establish the generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality in this sense for two important cases: The L\'evy-Prokhorov distance on distributions, which finds wide-spread applications in machine learning due to its favourable stability properties, and the standard metric on convex sets of distributions that arises by combining the Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances.</description>

Abstract: We consider a little-known abstract decomposition result for positive measures due to Dellacherie, and show that it yields many decompositions of measures, several of which are new. We then extend Dellacherie's result to (controlled) vector measures, and apply it to obtain a decomposition of semimartingales due to Bichteler, on which we improve. Then, we investigate how the outputs of the decomposition depend on its inputs, in particular characterising the two elements of the decomposition as projections in the sense of Riesz spaces and of metric spaces. Finally, we prove a decomposition theorem for strictly positive operators on Riesz spaces which generalises Dellacherie's Theorem.</description>

Abstract: We study It\^o SDE systems driven by oscillating functions of a single It\^o diffusion process. In the limit when oscillations become fast, we show that the solution process converges in law to the process defined by an SDE system driven by a multivariate Wiener process whose covariance we calculate explicitly. Interestingly, the limiting system of SDEs are most naturally stated using the Stratonovich integral. The problem has been originally motivated by experimental work and special cases of theorems proved here provide a rigorous treatment of equations arising from physics.</description>

      <title>The scaling limit of the root component in the Wired Minimal Spanning Forest of the Poisson Weighted Infinite Tree</title>

Abstract: In this paper we prove a scaling limit result for the component of the root in the Wired Minimal Spanning Forest (WMSF) of the Poisson-Weighted Infinite Tree (PWIT), where the latter tree arises as the local weak limit of the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) on the complete graph endowed with i.i.d. weights on its edges. The limiting object can be obtained by aggregating independent Brownian trees using two types of gluing procedures: one that we call the Brownian tree aggregation process and resembles the so-called stick-breaking construction of the Brownian tree; and another one that we call the chain construction, which simply corresponds to gluing a sequence of metric spaces along a line.</description>

      <title>Precise Large Deviations for the Total Population of Heavy-tailed Critical Branching Processes with Immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the partial sum $S_{n}=X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}$ of the critical branching process with immigration $\{X_{n}\}$, when the offspring $\xi$ is regularly varying with index $\nu+1$ and the immigration $\eta$ is regularly varying with index $\delta$ $(0\leq \nu&lt;\delta&lt;1)$. The precise large deviation probabilities for $S_{n}$ are specified, that is, for some appropriate sequences $\{x_{n}\}$ and $\{y_{n}\}$, uniformly for $x_{n}\leq x\leq y_{n}$, $P(S_{n}&gt;x)\sim nx^{-\delta/(1+\nu)}L(x)$, where $L(x)$ is a slowly varying function. Different from that of the subcritical case, here the upper bound $y_n$ is needed. Essentially, this is because the tail probability of the stationary distribution is determined by the offspring or the immigration in the subcritical case. But it is determined by both when the process is critical.</description>

Abstract: We develop a fractional extension of the classical binomial distribution and the associated Bernstein operator, formulated within the framework of the generalized binomial theorem (Hara and Hino [Bull.\ London Math.\ Soc. \textbf{42} (2010), 467--477]). This provides a new probabilistic structure not representable as the law of the sum of independent and identically distributed random variables. Despite this nonstandard nature, we establish several of its fundamental analytic and probabilistic properties, including limit theorems,through a unified framework based on the generalized binomial theorem.We further analyze the properties of the fractional Bernstein operator associated with the fractional binomial distribution. In particular, we prove that the iterates of the operator converge to a generalized Wright--Fisher diffusion semigroup after a proper diffusive rescaling.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we present a novel connection between a multi-type (vector) multiplicative coalescent process and a multi-type branching process with Poisson offspring distributions. More specifically, we show that the equations that govern the phenomenon of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process are equivalent to the equations that yield the extinction probabilities of the corresponding multi-type Poisson branching process. We then leverage this connection with two applications, one in each direction. The first is a new quick proof of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process, and the second is a new series expression for the extinction probabilities of the multi-type Poisson branching process. We also use random graphs to give a new derivation of the solution to the modified Smoluchowski coagulation equations, which describe the vector multiplicative coalescent process.</description>

      <title>Explosion of Crump-Mode-Jagers processes with critical immediate offspring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of explosion in general (Crump-Mode-Jagers) branching processes, which refers to the event where an infinite number of individuals are born in finite time. In a critical setting where the expected number of immediate offspring per individual is exactly one, whether or not explosion occurs depends on the fine properties of the reproduction point process. We provide two sufficient conditions for explosion in these CMJ processes. The first uses a comparison with Galton-Watson processes in varying environments, while the second relies on a comparison with Bellman-Harris branching processes. Our main result is an equivalent characterization of explosion, expressed as an integral test, in the case where the reproduction point process is Poisson. For the derivation, we also study the fixed-point equation associated with a smoothing transform, which is known to describe the distribution of the explosion time. We use multiplicative martingales to show that this distribution is an attractive fixed point of the smoothing transform, which in particular implies its uniqueness modulo an additive shift.</description>

      <title>Reversible Imprecise Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reversible Markov chains play a central role in stochastic modelling and in algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Motivated by the fundamental importance of reversibility in classical settings, this paper develops a theoretical framework for reversible imprecise Markov chains. We focus on their structural properties and their representation through joint distribution matrices. Adopting the strong independence interpretation, we reverse every precise chain compatible with a given imprecise Markov chain specification. Since the reversed ensemble generally cannot be encoded by the usual forward model defined by an imprecise initial distribution and a set of transition matrices, we introduce a symmetric representation based on credal sets of two-step joint distribution (or edge measure) matrices. This strictly more expressive framework naturally admits the reversal operation and reduces reversibility to simple matrix symmetry. Moreover, forward and reverse dynamics can be described simultaneously within a single closed convex set, providing a unified structural basis for the analysis of expectations of path-dependent functionals. We illustrate the theory with random walks on graphs and outline methods for computing lower and upper expectations of such functionals.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic look at the infinite hat-guessing game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we look at a hat-guessing game, in which each player must guess the color of their own hat while only seeing the hats of the other players. We focus on the case of two hat colors and a countably infinite number of players. By strategizing in advance, the players can, in some ways, do much better than random guessing; using the axiom of choice, they can in fact achieve highly counter-intuitive success. We review some of these results. Then, we use tools from probability to obtain bounds on how successful a strategy can be under a measurability hypothesis, in terms of the asymptotic density of the set of correctly guessing players. As we discuss, this illustrates that the full axiom of choice is truly necessary for the counter-intuitively successful strategies, and that there is a wide gap between what can be achieved with and without choice.</description>

      <title>From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player-funded stochastic-differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>

Abstract: We show that $h_\infty(X+Y)\leq h_\infty(Z+W)$, where $X, Y$ are independent log-concave random variables, and $Z, W$ are exponential random variables having the same respective $\infty$-R\'enyi entropies. Analogs for integer-valued monotone log-concave random variables are also obtained. Our main tools are decreasing rearrangement, majorization, and the change of measure.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles for the Gross Pitaevskii Gibbs measure at low temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the large deviation principle for the conditional Gibbs measure associated with the focusing Gross Pitaevskii equation in the low temperature regime. This conditional measure is of mixed type, being canonical in energy and microcanonical in particle number. In particular, our result extends the large deviation principle for the mixed ensemble studied by Ellis, Jordan, Otto, and Turkington to a more singular setting, where the interaction potential is unbounded and the conditional event involves diverging renormalization constants. As a consequence of the large deviation principle, the Gibbs measure concentrates along the soliton manifold in the low temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Edgeworth expansion on Wiener chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider $F$ an element of the $p$-th Wiener chaos $\WW_p$, and denote by $\prob_F$ its law. For a positive integer $m$, let $\boldsymbol{\gamma}_{F,m}$ be the Radon measure with density $x \mapsto \frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left(1 + \sum_{k=3}^{4m-1} \frac{\E[H_k(F)]}{k!}\, H_k(x)\right)$, where $H_k$ is the $k$-th Hermite polynomial. The main goal of this article is to prove that the total variation distance between $\prob_F$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}_{F,m}$ is of order $\Var(\Gamma(F,F))^{({m+1})/{2}}$, where $\Gamma(F,F)$ denotes the carr\'e-du-champ operator of $F$. The variance of $\Gamma(F,F)$ is known to govern Gaussian fluctuations and can be bounded from above by $\kappa_4(F)$, the fourth cumulant of $F$, as established in the seminal work \cite{NP2009a}. Our result thus provides a genuine Edgeworth expansion in the setting of central convergence on Wiener chaoses. In this context, the quantity $\Var(\Gamma(F,F))$ plays the role of the small parameter that governs the accuracy of the approximation, in the same way that $1/\sqrt{n}$ does in the classical central limit theorem. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to establish Edgeworth expansions for Wiener chaoses in full generality and at arbitrary order, together with explicit remainder bounds that systematically improve with the order of the expansion--exactly as one would expect from an Edgeworth approximation. Our results apply verbatim to every situation where a central limit theorem is available for chaos elements, since no structural assumption is required beyond belonging to a fixed Wiener chaos. As a byproduct, we recover the celebrated optimal fourth moment theorem from \cite{NP2015} by combining the expansions at the first and second orders, with sharper quantitative bounds. Previous works on Edgeworth expansions for Wiener chaoses were essentially restricted to the first order.</description>

      <title>Stein's method for Fr\'echet approximation: a regularly varying functions approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a variant of Stein's method of comparison of generators
  to bound the Kolmogorov, total variation, and Wasserstein-1
  distances between distributions on the real line. Our discrepancy is
  expressed in terms of the ratio of reverse hazard rates; it
  therefore remains tractable even when density derivatives are
  intractable. Our main application concerns the approximation of
  normalized extremes by Fr\'echet laws. In this setting, the new
  discrepancy provides a quantitative measure of distributional
  proximity in terms of the average regular variation at infinity of
  the underlying cumulative distribution function. We illustrate the
  approach through explicit computations for maxima of Pareto, Cauchy,
  and Burr~XII distributions.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Stationary Solutions to McKean-Vlasov Equations with Applications to Noisy Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a function space. This framework provides a transparent description of local bifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while accommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that characterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical, subcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple Fourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also characterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the stationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of Fourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity properties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and coexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying discontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the minimum free energy map. As an application, we specialize the theory to the Noisy Mean-Field Transformer model, where we show how changing the inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ affects the geometry of the infinitely many bifurcations from the uniform measure. We also explain how increasing $\beta$ can lead to a rich class of approximate multi-mode stationary solutions which can be seen as `metastable states'. Further, a sharp transition from continuous to discontinuous (first-order) phase behavior is observed as $\beta$ increases.</description>

      <title>A martingale approach to noncommutative stochastic calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to noncommutative stochastic calculus that is, like the classical theory, based primarily on the martingale property. Using this approach, we introduce a general theory of stochastic integration and quadratic (co)variation for a certain class of noncommutative processes, analogous to semimartingales, that includes both the $q$-Brownian motions and classical matrix-valued Brownian motions. As applications, we obtain Burkholder--Davis--Gundy inequalities (with $p \geq 2$) for continuous-time noncommutative martingales and a noncommutative It\^{o}'s formula for "adapted $C^2$ maps," including trace $\ast$-polynomial maps and operator functions associated to the noncommutative $C^2$ scalar functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ introduced by Nikitopoulos, as well as the more general multivariate tracial noncommutative $C^2$ functions introduced by Jekel, Li, and Shlyakhtenko.</description>

      <title>Artificial Barriers for stochastic differential equations and for construction of boundary-preserving schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the novel method of artificial barriers for scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and use it to construct boundary-preserving numerical schemes for strong approximation of scalar SDEs, possibly with non-globally Lipschitz drift and diffusion coefficients, whose state-space is either bounded or half-bounded. The idea of artificial barriers is to augment the SDE with artificial barriers outside the state-space to not change the solution process, and then apply a boundary-preserving numerical scheme to the resulting reflected SDE (RSDE). This enables us to construct boundary-preserving numerical schemes that achieve the same strong convergence rate as the corresponding RSDE scheme. Based on the method of artificial barriers, we construct two boundary-preserving schemes that we call the Artificial Barriers Euler--Maruyama (ABEM) scheme and the Artificial Barriers Euler--Peano (ABEP) scheme, respectively. We provide numerical experiments for the ABEM scheme and the numerical results agree with the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Boundary-preserving weak approximation for some semilinear stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a boundary-preserving numerical scheme for the weak approximation for some stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with bounded state-space. We impose regularity assumptions on the drift and diffusion coefficients only locally on the state-space. In particular, the drift and diffusion coefficients may be non-globally Lipschitz continuous and superlinearly growing. The scheme consists of a finite difference discretisation in space and a Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration in time. The proposed scheme converges in the weak sense of order $1/4$ in time and of order $1/2$ in space, for globally Lipschitz continuous test functions. We prove the weak convergence order in time by proving strong convergence towards a strong solution driven by a different noise process. The convergence order in space follows from known results. The boundary-preserving property is ensured by the use of Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed Lie--Trotter-Exact (LTE) scheme compared to existing schemes for SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Statistics on monotonically ordered non-crossing partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study some combinatorial statistics defined on the set $NC^{(mton)}(n)$ of monotonically ordered non-crossing partitions of {1,...,n}, and on the set $NC_2^{(mton)}(2n)$ of monotonically ordered non-crossing pair-partitions of {1,...,2n}. Unlike in the analogous results known for unordered non-crossing partitions, the computations of expectations and variances for natural block-counting statistics on $NC^{(mton)}(n)$ and for the expectation of the area statistic on $NC_2^{(mton)}(2n)$ turn out to yield a logarithmic regime. An important role in our study is played by a nice tree structure on the disjoint union of the $NC^{(mton)}(n)$'s, which we use to streamline our arguments. As an illustration of how these ideas can be applied to calculations of cumulants in monotone probability, we discuss some combinatorial aspects of the monotonic Poisson process.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak quantitative estimates in slow-fast diffusions using filtering techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of slow-fast diffusions as the separation of scale diverges is a well-studied problem in the literature. In this short paper, we revisit this problem and obtain a new proof of existing strong quantitative convergence estimates (in particular, $L^2$ estimates) and weak convergence estimates in terms of $n$ (the parameter associated with the separation of scales). In particular, we obtain the rate of $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ in the strong convergence estimates and the rate of $n^{-1}$ for weak convergence estimate which are already known to be optimal in the literature. We achieve this using nonlinear filtering theory where we represent the evolution of fast diffusion in terms of its conditional distribution given the slow diffusion. We then use the well-known Kushner-Stratanovich equation which gives the evolution of the conditional distribution of the fast diffusion given the slow diffusion and establish that this conditional distribution approaches the invariant measure of the ``frozen" diffusion (obtained by freezing the slow variable in the evolution equation of the fast diffusion). At the heart of the analysis lies a key estimate of a weighted Lipschitz distance like function between a generic one-parameter family of measures and the family of unique invariant measures (of the ``frozen" diffusion parametrized by a path). This estimate is in terms of the operator norm of the dual of the infinitesimal generator of the ``frozen" diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a central limit theorem (CLT) for the non-parametric estimator of the transition matrices in controlled Markov chains (CMCs) with finite state-action spaces. Our results establish precise conditions on the logging policy under which the estimator is asymptotically normal, and reveal settings in which no CLT can exist. We then build upon it to derive CLTs for the value, Q-, and advantage functions of any stationary stochastic policy, including the optimal policy recovered from the estimated model. Goodness-of-fit tests are derived as a corollary, which enable us to test whether the logged data is stochastic. These results provide new statistical tools for offline policy evaluation and optimal policy recovery, and enable hypothesis tests for transition probabilities.</description>

      <title>Short-time blowup statistics of a Brownian particle in repulsive potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n &gt; 1$, a particle starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution $P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n &gt; 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of solutions to a class of evolution equations arising from random-time changes driven by subordinators. Our focus is on fractional diffusion equations involving mixed local and nonlocal operators. By combining techniques from probability theory, asymptotic analysis, and partial differential equations (PDEs), we characterize the dynamics of the subordinated solutions. This approach extends classical fractional dynamics and establishes a deeper connection between stochastic processes and deterministic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Elementary differentials from multi-indices to rooted trees</title>

Abstract: Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the relaxed Electron MHD equations with random diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) equations without resistivity, a regime known to be ill-posed in Sobolev and Gevrey spaces due to the quasilinear nature of the system. Motivated by recent work on stochastic regularization of the inviscid primitive equations [R. Hu, Q. Lin, and R. Liu, J. Nonlinear Sci. 35:84 (2025)], we introduce a modified EMHD model where resistivity is replaced by multiplicative noise and the nonlinear term is regularized by a fractional derivative. In particular, the classical advection term $(B \cdot \nabla)J$ is replaced by its fractional version $(B \cdot \nabla^\alpha)J$ with $0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1$. We show that for $\alpha &lt; 1$, the system is locally well-posed almost surely in suitable Gevrey spaces, and globally well-posed with high probability for small initial data. The results demonstrate that stochastic perturbations can restore well-posedness in a broader class of quasilinear magnetic models relevant to plasma dynamics and turbulence.</description>
