      <title>Process-and-Forward: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Over Cooperative Relay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) approach to image transmission over a cooperative relay channel. The relay either amplifies and forwards a scaled version of its received signal, referred to as DeepJSCC-AF, or leverages neural networks to extract relevant features about the source signal before forwarding it to the destination, which we call DeepJSCC-PF (Process-and-Forward). In the full-duplex scheme, inspired by the block Markov coding (BMC) concept, we introduce a novel block transmission strategy built upon novel vision transformer architecture. In the proposed scheme, the source transmits information in blocks, and the relay updates its knowledge about the input signal after each block and generates its own signal to be conveyed to the destination. To enhance practicality, we introduce an adaptive transmission model, which allows a single trained DeepJSCC model to adapt seamlessly to various channel qualities, making it a versatile solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed DeepJSCC compared to the state-of-the-art BPG image compression algorithm, even when operating at the maximum achievable rate of conventional decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward protocols, for both half-duplex and full-duplex relay scenarios.</description>

      <title>Integration of 5G and Motion Sensors for Vehicular Positioning: A Loosely-Coupled Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize the transportation industry by enhancing traffic efficiency and road safety. However, achieving optimal vehicular autonomy demands an uninterrupted and precise positioning solution, especially in deep urban environments. 5G mmWave holds immense potential to provide such a service due to its accurate range and angle measurements. Yet, as mmWave signals are prone to signal blockage, severe positioning errors will occur. Most of the 5G positioning literature relies on constant motion models to bridge such 5G outages, which do not capture the true dynamics of the vehicle. Few proposed methodologies rely on inertial measurement units (IMUs) to bridge such gaps, where they predominantly use tightly coupled (TC) integration schemes, introducing a nonlinear 5G measurement model. Such approaches, which rely on Kalman filtering, necessitate the linearization of the measurement model, leading to pronounced positioning errors. In this paper, however, we propose a loosely coupled (LC) sensor fusion scheme to integrate 5G, IMUs, and odometers to mitigate linearization errors. Additionally, we propose a novel method to design the process covariance matrix of the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Moreover, we propose enhancements to the mechanization of the IMU data to enhance the standalone IMU solution. The proposed methodologies were tested using a novel setup comprising 5G measurements from Siradel's S_5G simulation tool and real IMU and odometer measurements from an hour-long trajectory. The proposed method resulted in 14 cm of error for 95% of the time compared to 1 m provided by the traditional constant velocity model approach.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Nonlinearity Estimated and Compensated Diffusion LMS Algorithm: Theoretical Upper Bound, Cramer-Rao Lower bound, and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an algorithm for estimation and compensation of second-order nonlinearity in wireless sensor setwork (WSN) in distributed estimation framework is proposed. First, the effect of second-order nonlinearity on the performance of Diffusion Least Mean Square (DLMS) algorithm is investigated and an upper bound for $l^2$-norm of the error due to nonlinearity is derived mathematically. Second, mean convergence analysis of the DLMS algorithm in presence of second-order nonlinearity is derived. Third, a distributed algorithm is suggested which consists of extra nonlinearity estimation and compensation units. Moreover, considering the second-order nonlinearity, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating both the unknown vector and nonlinearity coefficient vector is calculated, in which the Fisher information matrix is obtained in a closed-form formula. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving the performance of distributed estimation in the presence of nonlinear sensors in a WSN.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Double-Active-RIS-aided Communication Systems with Inter-Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a double-active-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided downlink wireless communication system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna users with both double reflection and single reflection links. Due to the signal amplification capability of active RISs, the mutual influence between active RISs, which is termed as the "inter-excitation" effect, cannot be ignored. Then, we develop a feedback-type model to characterize the signal containing the inter-excitation effect. Based on the signal model, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the beamforming matrix at the BS and the reflecting coefficient matrices at the two active RISs, subject to power constraints at the BS and active RISs, as well as the maximum amplification gain constraints of the active RISs. To solve this non-convex problem, we first transform the problem into a more tractable form using the fractional programming (FP) method. Then, by introducing auxiliary variables, the problem can be converted into an equivalent form that can be solved by using a low-complexity penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm. Finally, simulation results indicate that it is crucial to consider the inter-excitation effect between active RISs in beamforming design for double-active-RIS-aided communication systems. Additionally, it prevails over other benchmark schemes with single active RIS and double passive RISs in terms of achievable rate.</description>

      <title>Double-Private Distributed Estimation Algorithm Using Differential Privacy and a Key-Like Proportionate Matrix with Its Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief, we present an enhanced privacy-preserving distributed estimation algorithm, referred to as the ``Double-Private Algorithm," which combines the principles of both differential privacy (DP) and cryptography. The proposed algorithm enhances privacy by introducing DP noise into the intermediate estimations of neighboring nodes. Additionally, we employ an inverse of a closed-form reproducible proportionate gain matrix as the cryptographic key matrix to fortify the privacy protection within the proposed double private algorithm. \textcolor{blue}{We improve the algorithm by transmitting alternative variable vectors instead of raw measurements, resulting in enhanced key matrix reconstruction performance. This innovative approach mitigate noise impact, enhancing overall algorithm effectiveness.} We also establish an upper bound for the norm of the error between the non-private Diffusion Least Mean Square (DLMS) algorithm and our double private algorithm. Further, we determine a sufficient condition for the step-size to ensure the mean convergence of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, particularly its ability to attain the final Mean Square Deviation (MSD) comparable to that of the non-private DLMS.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber Domain Sparse Channel Estimation in Holographic MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the sparse channel estimation in holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) systems. The conventional angular-domain representation fails to capture the continuous angular power spectrum characterized by the spatially-stationary electromagnetic random field, thus leading to the ambiguous detection of the significant angular power, which is referred to as the power leakage. To tackle this challenge, the HMIMO channel is represented in the wavenumber domain for exploring its cluster-dominated sparsity. Specifically, a finite set of Fourier harmonics acts as a series of sampling probes to encapsulate the integral of the power spectrum over specific angular regions. This technique effectively eliminates power leakage resulting from power mismatches induced by the use of discrete angular-domain probes. Next, the channel estimation problem is recast as a sparse recovery of the significant angular power spectrum over the continuous integration region. We then propose an accompanying graph-cut-based swap expansion (GCSE) algorithm to extract beneficial sparsity inherent in HMIMO channels. Numerical results demonstrate that this wavenumber-domainbased GCSE approach achieves robust performance with rapid convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel sparse signal detection scheme designed for a correlated Markovian Bernoulli-Gaussian sparse signal model, which can equivalently be viewed as a block sparse signal model. Despite the inherent complexity of the model, our approach yields a closed-form detection criterion. Theoretical analyses of the proposed detector are provided, including the computation of false alarm probability and detection probability through closed-form formulas.

      <title>Nonlinear Self-Interference Cancellation With Learnable Orthonormal Polynomials for Full-Duplex Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear self-interference cancellation (SIC) is essential for full-duplex communication systems, which can offer twice the spectral efficiency of traditional half-duplex systems. The challenge of nonlinear SIC is similar to the classic problem of system identification in adaptive filter theory, whose crux lies in identifying the optimal nonlinear basis functions for a nonlinear system. This becomes especially difficult when the system input has a non-stationary distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for nonlinear digital SIC that adaptively constructs orthonormal polynomial basis functions according to the non-stationary moments of the transmit signal. By combining these basis functions with the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm, we introduce a new SIC technique, called as the adaptive orthonormal polynomial LMS (AOP-LMS) algorithm. To reduce computational complexity for practical systems, we augment our approach with a precomputed look-up table, which maps a given modulation and coding scheme to its corresponding basis functions. Numerical simulation indicates that our proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art SIC algorithms in terms of convergence speed and mean squared error when the transmit signal is non-stationary, such as with adaptive modulation and coding. Experimental evaluation with a wireless testbed confirms that our proposed approach outperforms existing digital SIC algorithms.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Coverage Analysis of K-Tier Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Downlink Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) can significantly expand network coverage while diminishing reliance on terrestrial infrastructure. Despite the enticing potential of ISTNs, there is no comprehensive mathematical performance analysis framework for these emerging networks. In this paper, we introduce a tractable approach to analyze the downlink coverage performance of multi-tier ISTNs, where each network tier operates with orthogonal frequency bands. The proposed approach is to model the spatial distribution of cellular and satellite base stations using homogeneous Poisson point processes arranged on concentric spheres with varying radii. Central to our analysis is a displacement principle that transforms base station locations on different spheres into projected rings while preserving the distance distribution to the typical user. By incorporating the effects of Shadowed-Rician fading on satellite channels and employing orthogonal frequency bands, we derive analytical expressions for coverage in the integrated networks while keeping full generality. Our primary discovery is that network performance reaches its maximum when selecting the optimal density ratio of users associated with the network according to the density and the channel parameters of each network. Through simulations, we validate the precision of our derived expressions.</description>

      <title>Smart structural health monitoring (SHM) system for on-board localization of defects in pipes using torsional ultrasonic guided waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most reported research for monitoring health of pipelines using ultrasonic guided waves (GW) typically utilize bulky piezoelectric transducer rings and laboratory-grade ultrasonic non-destructive testing (NDT) equipment. Consequently, the translation of these approaches from laboratory settings to field-deployable systems for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) becomes challenging. In this work, we present an innovative algorithm for damage identification and localization in pipes, implemented on a compact FPGA-based smart GW-SHM system. The custom-designed board, featuring a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and front-end electronics, is capable of actuating the PZT thickness shear mode transducers, data acquisition and recording from PZT sensors and generating a damage index (DI) map for localizing the damage on the structure. The algorithm is a variation of the common source method adapted for cylindrical geometry. The utility of the algorithm is demonstrated for detection and localization of defects such as notch and mass loading on a steel pipe, through extensive finite element (FE) method simulations. Experimental results obtained using a C-clamp for applying mass loading on the pipe show good agreement with the FE simulations. The localization error values for experimental data analyzed using C code on a processor implemented on the FPGA are consistent with algorithm results generated on a computer running MATLAB code. The system presented in this study is suitable for a wide range of GW-SHM applications, especially in cost-sensitive scenarios that benefit from on-node signal processing over cloud-based solutions.</description>

      <title>Principles and Optimization of Reflective Intelligent Surface Assisted mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conceptual example is first analyzed to show that efficient wireless communications is possible, when user equipment (UE) receiver, BS transmitter or/and the scatter (reflector) in wireless channels employ the required channel state information (CSI) to remove the randomness of signal phase. Then, the principles and optimization of three reflective intelligent surface (RIS) assisted mmWave (RIS-mmWave) models are introduced. The first model assumes one BS, one RIS and one UE; the second one assumes one BS, one RIS and multiple UEs; while the third RIS-mmWave model assumes one BS, multiple RISs and multiple UEs. Furthermore, the optimization of BS precoder and RIS phase-shifts is addressed in the context of the massive RIS-mmWave scenarios, where the number of BS antennas and that of RIS reflection elements are significantly larger than the number of supported UEs. The analyses demonstrate that, while the deployment of RISs with mmWave is capable of solving the blockage problem and has the potential to significantly improve efficiency, finding the near-optimum solutions for RIS phase-shifts is highly challenging in practice.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Method for Beat-Level Risk Analysis and Interpretation of Atrial Fibrillation Patients during Sinus Rhythm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia. Many AF patients experience complications such as stroke and other cardiovascular issues. Early detection of AF is crucial. Existing algorithms can only distinguish ``AF rhythm in AF patients'' from ``sinus rhythm in normal individuals'' . However, AF patients do not always exhibit AF rhythm, posing a challenge for diagnosis when the AF rhythm is absent. To address this, this paper proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to distinguish ``sinus rhythm in AF patients'' and ``sinus rhythm in normal individuals'' in beat-level. We introduce beat-level risk interpreters, trend risk interpreters, addressing the interpretability issues of deep learning models and the difficulty in explaining AF risk trends. Additionally, the beat-level information fusion decision is presented to enhance model accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the average AUC for single beats used as testing data from CPSC 2021 dataset is 0.7314. By employing 150 beats for information fusion decision algorithm, the average AUC can reach 0.7591. Compared to previous segment-level algorithms, we utilized beats as input, reducing data dimensionality and making the model more lightweight, facilitating deployment on portable medical devices. Furthermore, we draw new and interesting findings through average beat analysis and subgroup analysis, considering varying risk levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positioning has recently received considerable attention as a key enabler in emerging applications such as extended reality, unmanned aerial vehicles and smart environments. These applications require both data communication and high-precision positioning, and thus they are particularly well-suited to be offered in wireless networks (WNs). The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of existing works and new trends in the field of positioning techniques from both the academic and industrial perspectives. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of positioning in WNs, covering the background, applications, measurements, state-of-the-art technologies and future challenges. The paper outlines the applications of positioning from the perspectives of public facilities, enterprises and individual users. We investigate the key performance indicators and measurements of positioning systems, followed by the review of the key enabler techniques such as artificial intelligence/large models and adaptive systems. Next, we discuss a number of typical wireless positioning technologies. We extend our overview beyond the academic progress, to include the standardization efforts, and finally, we provide insight into the challenges that remain. The comprehensive overview of exisitng efforts and new trends in the field of positioning from both the academic and industrial communities would be a useful reference to researchers in the field.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication over High Mobility Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become a promising technology for future communication system. In this paper, we consider a millimeter wave system over high mobility scenario, and propose a novel simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided ISAC scheme. To improve the communication service of the in-vehicle user equipment (UE) and simultaneously track and sense the vehicle with the help of nearby roadside units (RSUs), a STAR-RIS is equipped on the outside surface of the vehicle. Firstly, an efficient transmission structure is developed, where a number of training sequences with orthogonal precoders and combiners are respectively utilized at BS and RSUs for channel parameter extraction. Then, the near-field static channel model between the STAR-RIS and in-vehicle UE as well as the far-field time-frequency selective BS-RIS-RSUs channel model are characterized. By utilizing the multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (MOMP) algorithm, the cascaded channel parameters of the BS-RIS-RSUs links can be obtained at the RSUs. Thus, the vehicle localization and its velocity measurement can be acquired by jointly utilizing these extracted cascaded channel parameters of all RSUs. Note that the MOMP algorithm can be further utilized to extract the channel parameters of the BS-RIS-UE link for communication. With the help of sensing results, the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS are delicately designed, which can significantly improve the received signal strength for both the RSUs and the in-vehicle UE, and can finally enhance the sensing and communication performance. Moreover, the trade-off for sensing and communication is designed by optimizing the energy splitting factors of the STAR-RIS. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed STAR-RIS aided ISAC scheme.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Approach for Rapid Detection of Aeroelastic Modes from Flutter Flight Test Based on Limited Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flutter flight test involves the evaluation of the airframes aeroelastic stability by applying artificial excitation on the aircraft lifting surfaces. The subsequent responses are captured and analyzed to extract the frequencies and damping characteristics of the system. However, noise contamination, turbulence, non-optimal excitation of modes, and sensor malfunction in one or more sensors make it time-consuming and corrupt the extraction process. In order to expedite the process of identifying and analyzing aeroelastic modes, this study implements a time-delay embedded Dynamic Mode Decomposition technique. This approach is complemented by Robust Principal Component Analysis methodology, and a sparsity promoting criterion which enables the automatic and optimal selection of sparse modes. The anonymized flutter flight test data, provided by the fifth author of this research paper, is utilized in this implementation. The methodology assumes no knowledge of the input excitation, only deals with the responses captured by accelerometer channels, and rapidly identifies the aeroelastic modes. By incorporating a compressed sensing algorithm, the methodology gains the ability to identify aeroelastic modes, even when the number of available sensors is limited.

      <title>Specific Emitter Identification Handling Modulation Variation with Margin Disparity Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), it is recognized that transmitters can be distinguished through the impairments of their radio frequency front-end, commonly referred to as Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF) features. However, modulation schemes can be deliberately coupled into signal-level data to confound RFF information, often resulting in high susceptibility to failure in SEI. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant feature oriented Margin Disparity Discrepancy (MDD) approach to enhance SEI's robustness in rapidly modulation-varying environments. First, we establish an upper bound for the difference between modulation domains and define the loss function accordingly. Then, we design an adversarial network framework incorporating MDD to align variable modulation features. Finally, We conducted experiments utilizing 7 HackRF-One transmitters, emitting 11 types of signals with analog and digital modulations. Numerical results indicate that our approach achieves an average improvement of over 20\% in accuracy compared to classical SEI methods and outperforms other UDA techniques.

      <title>Task-Oriented Hybrid Beamforming for OFDM-DFRC Systems with Flexibly Controlled Space-Frequency Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the issues of the hybrid beamforming design for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system in multiple task scenarios involving the radar scanning and detection task and the target tracking task. To meet different task requirements of the DFRC system, we introduce two novel radar beampattern metrics, the average integrated sidelobe to minimum mainlobe ratio (AISMMR) and average peak sidelobe to integrated mainlobe ratio (APSIMR), to characterize the space-frequency spectra in different scenarios. Then, two HBF design problems are formulated for two task scenarios by minimizing the AISMMR and APSIMR respectively subject to the constraints of communication quality-of-service (QoS), power budget, and hardware. Due to the non-linearity and close coupling between the analog and digital beamformers in both the objective functions and QoS constraint, the resultant formulated problems are challenging to solve. Towards that end, a unified optimization algorithm based on a consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM) is proposed to solve these two problems. Moreover, under the unified CADMM framework, the closed-form solutions of primal variables in the original two problems are obtained with low complexity. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Simplified Self-homodyne Coherent System Based on Alamouti Coding and Digital Subcarrier Multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent technology inherent with more availabledegrees of freedom is deemed a competitive solution for nextgeneration ultra-high-speed short-reach optical interconnects.However, the fatal barriers to implementing the conventiona.coherent system in short-reach optical interconnect are the costfootprint, and power consumption. Self-homodyne coherentsystem exhibits its potential to reduce the power consumption ofthe receiver-side digital signal processing (Rx-DSP) by deliveringthe local oscillator (LO) from the transmitter. However, anautomatic polarization controller (APC) is inevitable in the remoteLO link to avoid polarization fading, resulting in additional costsTo address the polarization fading issue, a simplified self.homodyne coherent system is proposed enabled by Alamouticoding in this paper. Benefiting from the Alamouti coding betweentwo polarizations, a polarization-insensitive receiver onlyincluding a 3dB coupler, a 90o Hybrid, and two balancedphotodiodes (BPDs)is sufficient for reception. Meanwhile, theAPC in the LO link is needless, simplifying the receiver structuresignificantly. Besides, the digital subcarrier multiplexing (DSCM)technique is also adopted to relax the computational complexity ofthe chromatic dispersion compensation (CDC), which is one of thedominant power consumption modules in Rx-DSP. Thetransmission performance of 50Gbaud 4-subcarrier 16/32OAM(4SC-16/320AM) DSCM signal based on the proposed simplifiedself-homodyne coherent system is investigated experimentallyThe results show that the bit-error-ratio(BER) performancedegradation caused by CD can be solved by increasing 4 taps inthe equalizer for 80km single mode fiber(SMF)transmissionwithout individual CDC, which operates in a low-complexitymanner.</description>

      <title>A Wideband Distributed Massive MIMO Channel Sounder for Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel sounding is a vital step in understanding wireless channels for the design and deployment of wireless communication systems. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a coherent distributed massive MIMO channel sounder operating at 5-6 GHz with a bandwidth of 400 MHz based on the NI USRP X410. Through the integration of transceiver chains and RF switches, the design facilitates the use of a larger number of antennas without significant compromise in dynamic capability. Our current implementation is capable of measuring thousands of antenna combinations within tens of milliseconds. Every radio frequency switch is seamlessly integrated with a 16-element antenna array, making the antennas more practical to be transported and flexibly distributed. In addition, the channel sounder features real-time processing to reduce the data stream to the host computer and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The design and implementation are verified through two measurements in an indoor laboratory environment. The first measurement entails a single-antenna robot as transmitter and 128 distributed receiving antennas. The second measurement demonstrates a passive sensing scenario with a walking person. We evaluate the results of both measurements using the super-resolution algorithm SAGE. The results demonstrate the great potential of the presented sounding system for providing high-quality radio channel measurements, contributing to high-resolution channel estimation, characterization, and active and passive sensing in realistic and dynamic scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Concurrent with advancements in molecular communication (MC), bacterial communication is emerging as a key area of interest. Given the frequent use of bacteria in various MC models, it is essential to have a thorough grasp of their intrinsic communication, signaling, and engineering techniques. Although it is crucial to have a strong understanding of the communication background, the inherent biological variability of bacteria may introduce complexity. Thus, an in-depth understanding of bacteria and their communication is a must for improving and extending the models in which they are utilized. Furthermore, the emerging and evolving domain of bacterial computing provides an exciting opportunity for advancing applications in areas such as environmental monitoring and biological computing networks. By integrating the communication and sensing capabilities, bacterial computing offers a promising framework for enhancing the adaptability and responsiveness of bacteria. This paper provides a comprehensive review of bacterial communication and computing, illustrating their application and the link with the concept of the Internet of Everything (IoE). Through the analysis of these biological systems, we reach a deeper insight on how the small-scale interactions may contribute to the major concept of universal interconnectedness; thus, we make the knowledge to flow and communication stronger between different fields. The discussion include the identification of the different bacterial mechanisms that could revolutionize the traditional communication systems. Thus, this paper offers valuable insights into previously unaddressed aspects of bacterial behavior, suggesting novel avenues for future research and aiming to advance understanding and application of bacterial sensing, communication and computing in MC models.</description>

      <title>Semantic Extraction Model Selection for IoT Devices in Edge-assisted Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications offer the potential to alleviate communication loads by exchanging meaningful information. However, semantic extraction (SE) is computationally intensive, posing challenges for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To address this, leveraging computing resources at the edge servers (ESs) is essential. ESs can support multiple SE models for various tasks, making it crucial to select appropriate SE models based on diverse requirements of IoT devices and limited ES computing resources. In this letter, we study an SE model selection problem, where the ES co-located at the access point can provide multiple SE models to execute the uploaded SE tasks of associated IoT devices. We aim to maximize the total semantic rate of all SE tasks by selecting appropriate SE models, while considering SE delay and ES capacity constraints, and SE accuracy requirements. The formulated NP-complete integer programming problem is transformed into a modified Knapsack problem. The proposed efficient approximation algorithm using dynamic programming can yield a guaranteed near-optimum solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-informed ECG Dual Attention Network for Heart Failure Risk Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant public health challenge due to its rising global mortality rate. Addressing this issue through early diagnosis and prevention could significantly reduce the disease's impact. This work introduces a methodology for HF risk prediction using clinically acquired 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). We present a novel, lightweight dual-attention ECG network designed to capture complex ECG features essential for early HF prediction, despite the notable imbalance between low and high-risk groups. The network features a cross-lead attention module and twelve lead-specific temporal attention modules to capture cross-lead interactions and local temporal dynamics within each lead. To prevent model overfitting from limited training data, we leverage a large language model (LLM) with a public ECG-Report dataset for pretraining on an ECG-report alignment task. The network is then fine-tuned for HF risk prediction using two specific cohorts from the UK Biobank study, focusing on patients with hypertension (UKB-HYP) and those who have had a myocardial infarction (UKB-MI). Our findings show that LLM-informed pretraining significantly improves the network's HF risk prediction capability in these cohorts. Moreover, the dual-attention mechanism enhances interpretability and predictive performance, ensuring a transparent and reliable prediction process. The method outperforms existing models, achieving average C-index scores of 0.6349 and 0.5805 on the UKB-HYP and UKB-MI test sets, respectively. This performance demonstrates our approach's effectiveness in managing complex clinical ECG data and its potential to improve HF risk assessment across various populations.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Beamforming for In-band Full-duplex Multi-cell Multi-user Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a robust joint power allocation and beamforming scheme for in-band full-duplex multi-cell multi-user (IBFD-MCMU) networks. A mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated with constraints on the power budgets and residual self-interference (RSI) power. The problem is not convex, so we decompose it into two sub-problems: interference management beamforming and power allocation, and give closed-form solutions to the sub-problems. Then we propose an iterative algorithm to yield an overall solution. The computational complexity and convergence behavior of the algorithm are analyzed. Our method can enhance the analog self-interference cancellation (ASIC) depth provided by the precoder with less effect on the downlink communication than the existing null-space projection method, inspiring a low-cost but efficient IBFD transceiver design. It can achieve 42.9% of IBFD gain in terms of spectral efficiency with only antenna isolation, while this value increases to 60.9% with further digital self-interference cancellation (DSIC). Numerical results illustrate that our algorithm is robust to hardware impairments and channel uncertainty. With sufficient ASIC depth, our method reduces the computation time by at least 20% than the existing scheme due to its faster convergence speed at the cost of &lt; 12.5% sum rate loss. The benefit is much more significant with single-antenna users that our algorithm saves at least 40% of the computation time at the cost of &lt; 10% sum rate reduction.</description>

      <title>CSI Transfer From Sub-6G to mmWave: Reduced-Overhead Multi-User Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid beamforming is vital in modern wireless systems, especially for massive MIMO and millimeter-wave deployments, offering efficient directional transmission with reduced hardware complexity. However, effective beamforming in multi-user scenarios relies heavily on accurate channel state information, the acquisition of which often incurs excessive pilot overhead, degrading system performance. To address this and inspired by the spatial congruence between sub-6GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels, we propose a Sub-6G information Aided Multi-User Hybrid Beamforming (SA-MUHBF) framework, avoiding excessive use of pilots. SA-MUHBF employs a convolutional neural network to predict mmWave beamspace from sub-6G channel estimate, followed by a novel multi-layer graph neural network for analog beam selection and a linear minimum mean-square error algorithm for digital beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that SA-MUHBF efficiently predicts the mmWave beamspace representation and achieves superior spectrum efficiency over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, SA-MUHBF demonstrates robust performance across varied sub-6G system configurations and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Index Modulation Aided Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access via Constellation Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been widely nominated as an emerging spectral efficiency (SE) multiple access technique for the next generation of wireless communication network. To meet the growing demands in massive connectivity and huge data in transmission, a novel index modulation aided NOMA with the rotation of signal constellation of low power users (IM-NOMA-RC) is developed to the downlink transmission. In the proposed IM-NOMA-RC system, the users are classified into far-user group and near-user group according to their channel conditions, where the rotation constellation based IM operation is performed only on the users who belong to the near-user group that are allocated lower power compared with the far ones to transmit extra information. In the proposed IM-NOMA-RC, all the subcarriers are activated to transmit information to multiple users to achieve higher SE. With the aid of the multiple dimension modulation in IM-NOMA-RC, more users can be supported over an orthogonal resource block. Then, both maximum likelihood (ML) detector and successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector are studied for all the user. Numerical simulation results of the proposed IM-NOMARC scheme are investigate for the ML detector and the SIC detector for each users, which shows that proposed scheme can outperform conventional NOMA.</description>

      <title>Jointly Optimizing Terahertz based Sensing and Communications in Vehicular Networks: A Dynamic Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of vehicle service mode selection (sensing, communication, or both) and vehicle connections within terahertz (THz) enabled joint sensing and communications over vehicular networks is studied. The considered network consists of several service provider vehicles (SPVs) that can provide: 1) only sensing service, 2) only communication service, and 3) both services, sensing service request vehicles, and communication service request vehicles. Based on the vehicle network topology and their service accessibility, SPVs strategically select service request vehicles to provide sensing, communication, or both services. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the number of successfully served vehicles by jointly determining the service mode of each SPV and its associated vehicles. To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic graph neural network (GNN) model that selects appropriate graph information aggregation functions according to the vehicle network topology, thus extracting more vehicle network information compared to traditional static GNNs that use fixed aggregation functions for different vehicle network topologies. Using the extracted vehicle network information, the service mode of each SPV and its served service request vehicles will be determined. Simulation results show that the proposed dynamic GNN based method can improve the number of successfully served vehicles by up to 17% and 28% compared to a GNN based algorithm with a fixed neural network model and a conventional optimization algorithm without using GNNs.</description>

      <title>Secure Communication of Active RIS Assisted NOMA Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a revolutionary technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been deemed as an indispensable part of the 6th generation communications due to its inherent ability to regulate the wireless channels. However, passive RIS (PRIS) still suffers from some pressing issues, one of which is that the fading of the entire reflection link is proportional to the product of the distances from the base station to the PRIS and from the PRIS to the users, i.e., the productive attenuation. To tackle this problem, active RIS (ARIS) has been proposed to reconfigure the wireless propagation condition and alleviate the productive attenuation. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of the ARIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks with the attendance of external and internal eavesdroppers. To be specific, the closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secrecy system throughput are derived by invoking both imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect SIC. The secrecy diversity orders of legitimate users are obtained at high signal-to-noise ratios. Numerical results are presented to verify the accuracy of the theoretical expressions and indicate that: i) The SOP of ARIS assisted NOMA networks exceeds that of PRIS-NOMA, ARIS/PRIS-assisted orthogonal multiple access (OMA); ii) Due to the balance between the thermal noise and residual interference, introducing excess reconfigurable elements at ARIS is not helpful to reduce the SOP; and iii) The secrecy throughput performance of ARIS-NOMA networks outperforms that of PRIS-NOMA and ARIS/PRIS-OMA networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) have been envisioned as two promising technologies due to their high transmission reliability as well as energy-efficiency. This paper investigates the secrecy performance of RIS assisted AmBC networks. New closed-form and asymptotic expressions of secrecy outage probability for RIS-AmBC networks are derived by taking into account both imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect SIC (pSIC) cases. On top of these, the secrecy diversity order of legitimate user is obtained in high signal-to-noise ratio region, which equals \emph{zero} and is proportional to the number of RIS elements for ipSIC and pSIC, respectively. The secrecy throughput and energy efficiency are further surveyed to evaluate the secure effectiveness of RIS-AmBC networks. Numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of theoretical analyses and manifest that: i) The secrecy outage behavior of RIS-AmBC networks exceeds that of conventional AmBC networks; ii) Due to the mutual interference between direct and backscattering links, the number of RIS elements has an optimal value to minimise the secrecy system outage probability; and iii) Secrecy throughput and energy efficiency are strongly influenced by the reflecting coefficient and eavesdropper's wiretapping ability.</description>

      <title>Task-Based Quantizer Design for Sensing With Random Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, random signaling is used to convey useful information as well as sense the environment. Such randomness poses challenges in various components in sensing signal processing. In this paper, we investigate quantizer design for sensing in ISAC systems. Unlike quantizers for channel estimation in massive multiple-input-multiple-out (MIMO) communication systems, sensing in ISAC systems needs to deal with random nonorthogonal transmitted signals rather than a fixed orthogonal pilot. Considering sensing performance and hardware implementation, we focus on task-based hardware-limited quantization with spatial analog combining. We propose two strategies of quantizer optimization, i.e., data-dependent (DD) and data-independent (DI). The former achieves optimized sensing performance with high implementation overhead. To reduce hardware complexity, the latter optimizes the quantizer with respect to the random signal from a stochastic perspective. We derive the optimal quantizers for both strategies and formulate an algorithm based on sample average approximation (SAA) to solve the optimization in the DI strategy. Numerical results show that the optimized quantizers outperform digital-only quantizers in terms of sensing performance. Additionally, the DI strategy, despite its lower computational complexity compared to the DD strategy, achieves near-optimal sensing performance.</description>

      <title>A learning-based solution approach to the application placement problem in mobile edge computing under uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Placing applications in mobile edge computing servers presents a complex challenge involving many servers, users, and their requests. Existing algorithms take a long time to solve high-dimensional problems with significant uncertainty scenarios. Therefore, an efficient approach is required to maximize the quality of service while considering all technical constraints. One of these approaches is machine learning, which emulates optimal solutions for application placement in edge servers. Machine learning models are expected to learn how to allocate user requests to servers based on the spatial positions of users and servers. In this study, the problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming. A sufficient amount of training records is generated by varying parameters such as user locations, their request rates, and solving the optimization model. Then, based on the distance features of each user from the available servers and their request rates, machine learning models generate decision variables for the first stage of the stochastic optimization model, which is the user-to-server request allocation, and are employed as independent decision agents that reliably mimic the optimization model. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) are used in this research to achieve practical decisions from the stochastic optimization models. The performance of each model has shown an execution effectiveness of over 80%. This research aims to provide a more efficient approach for tackling high-dimensional problems and scenarios with uncertainties in mobile edge computing by leveraging machine learning models for optimal decision-making in request allocation to edge servers. These results suggest that machine-learning models can significantly improve solution times compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>A continuous boostlet transform for acoustic waves in space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse representation systems that encode the signal architecture have had an exceptional impact on sampling and compression paradigms. Remarkable examples are multi-scale directional systems, which, similar to our vision system, encode the underlying architecture of natural images with sparse features. Inspired by this philosophy, the present study introduces a representation system for acoustic waves in 2D space-time, referred to as the boostlet transform, which encodes sparse features of natural acoustic fields with the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations. Continuous boostlets, $\psi_{a,\theta,\tau}(\varsigma) = a^{-1} \psi \left(D_a^{-1} B_\theta^{-1}(\varsigma-\tau)\right) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$, are spatiotemporal functions parametrized with dilations $a &gt; 0$, Lorentz boosts $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$, and translations $\smash{\tau \in \mathbb{R}^2}$ in space--time. The admissibility condition requires that boostlets are supported away from the acoustic radiation cone, i.e., have phase velocities other than the speed of sound, resulting in a peculiar scaling function. The continuous boostlet transform is an isometry for $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$, and a sparsity analysis with experimentally measured fields indicates that boostlet coefficients decay faster than wavelets, curvelets, wave atoms, and shearlets. The uncertainty principles and minimizers associated with the boostlet transform are derived and interpreted physically.</description>

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms usually {force} reduction in data utility by producing ``out-of-bound'' noisy results for a tight privacy budget. We introduce the Budget Recycling Differential Privacy (BR-DP) framework, designed to provide soft-bounded noisy outputs for a broad range of existing DP mechanisms. By ``soft-bounded," we refer to the mechanism's ability to release most outputs within a predefined error boundary, thereby improving utility and maintaining privacy simultaneously. The core of BR-DP consists of two components: a DP kernel responsible for generating a noisy answer per iteration, and a recycler that probabilistically recycles/regenerates or releases the noisy answer. We delve into the privacy accounting of BR-DP, culminating in the development of a budgeting principle that optimally sub-allocates the available budget between the DP kernel and the recycler. Furthermore, we introduce algorithms for tight BR-DP accounting in composition scenarios, and our findings indicate that BR-DP achieves reduced privacy leakage post-composition compared to DP. Additionally, we explore the concept of privacy amplification via subsampling within the BR-DP framework and propose optimal sampling rates for BR-DP across various queries. We experiment with real data, and the results demonstrate BR-DP's effectiveness in lifting the utility-privacy tradeoff provided by DP mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Semantic-Bit Coexisting Communication System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems. Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to supe- rior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex Beamforming Systems with Coarse Quantization: How Many Bits Do We Need?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates full-duplex (FD) multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system design with coarse quantization. We first analyze the impact of self-interference (SI) on quantization in FD single-input single-output systems. The analysis elucidates that the minimum required number of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) bits is logarithmically proportional to the ratio of total received power to the received power of desired signals. Motivated by this, we design a FD MIMO beamforming method that effectively manages the SI. Dividing a spectral efficiency maximization beamforming problem into two sub-problems for alternating optimization, we address the first by optimizing the precoder: obtaining a generalized eigenvalue problem from the first-order optimality condition, where the principal eigenvector is the optimal stationary solution, and adopting a power iteration method to identify this eigenvector. Subsequently, a quantization-aware minimum mean square error combiner is computed for the derived precoder. Through numerical studies, we observe that the proposed beamformer reduces the minimum required number of ADC bits for achieving higher spectral efficiency than that of half-duplex (HD) systems, compared to FD benchmarks. The overall analysis shows that, unlike with quantized HD systems, more than 6 bits are required for the ADC to fully realize the potential of the quantized FD system.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided Single-frequency 3D Imaging by Exploiting Multi-view Image Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieving range information in three-dimensional (3D) radio imaging is particularly challenging due to the limited communication bandwidth and pilot resources. To address this issue, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided uplink communication scenario, generating multiple measurements through RIS phase adjustment. This study successfully realizes 3D single-frequency imaging by exploiting the near-field multi-view image correlations deduced from user mobility. We first highlight the significance of considering anisotropy in multi-view image formation by investigating radar cross-section properties and diffraction resolution limits. We then propose a novel model for joint multi-view 3D imaging that incorporates occlusion effects and anisotropic scattering. These factors lead to slow image support variation and smooth coefficient evolution, which are mathematically modeled as Markov processes. Based on this model, we employ the Expectation Maximization-Turbo-Generalized Approximate Message Passing algorithm for joint multi-view single-frequency 3D imaging with limited measurements. Simulation results reveal the superiority of joint multi-view imaging in terms of enhanced imaging ranges, accuracies, and anisotropy characterization compared to single-view imaging. Combining adjacent observations for joint multi-view imaging enables a reduction in the measurement overhead by 80%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving environment of mobile edge computing (MEC), optimizing system performance to meet the growing demand for low-latency computing services is a top priority. Integrating fluidic antenna (FA) technology into MEC networks provides a new approach to address this challenge. This letter proposes an FA-enabled MEC scheme that aims to minimize the total system delay by leveraging the mobility of FA to enhance channel conditions and improve computational offloading efficiency. By establishing an optimization problem focusing on the joint optimization of computation offloading and antenna positioning, we introduce an alternating iterative algorithm based on the interior point method and particle swarm optimization (IPPSO). Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed scheme compared to traditional fixed antenna positions, showing significant improvements in transmission rates and reductions in delays. The proposed IPPSO algorithm exhibits robust convergence properties, further validating the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Enhanced Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to leverage extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology, which significantly expands the range of the near-field region. The spherical wavefront characteristics in the near field introduce additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely distance and angle, into the channel model, which leads to unique challenges in channel estimation (CE). In this paper, we propose a new sensing-enhanced uplink CE scheme for near-field XL-MIMO, which notably reduces the required quantity of baseband samples and the dictionary size. In particular, we first propose a sensing method that can be accomplished in a single time slot. It employs power sensors embedded within the antenna elements to measure the received power pattern rather than baseband samples. A time inversion algorithm is then proposed to precisely estimate the locations of users and scatterers, which offers a substantially lower computational complexity. Based on the estimated locations from sensing, a novel dictionary is then proposed by considering the eigen-problem based on the near-field transmission model, which facilitates efficient near-field CE with less baseband sampling and a more lightweight dictionary. Moreover, we derive the general form of the eigenvectors associated with the near-field channel matrix, revealing their noteworthy connection to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS). Simulation results unveil that the proposed time inversion algorithm achieves accurate localization with power measurements only, and remarkably outperforms various widely-adopted algorithms in terms of computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed eigen-dictionary considerably improves the accuracy in CE with a compact dictionary size and a drastic reduction in baseband samples by up to 77%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of machine learning systems, the need to curtail their behavior has become increasingly apparent. This is evidenced by recent advancements towards developing models that satisfy robustness, safety, and fairness requirements. These requirements can be imposed (with generalization guarantees) by formulating constrained learning problems that can then be tackled by dual ascent algorithms. Yet, though these algorithms converge in objective value, even in non-convex settings, they cannot guarantee that their outcome is feasible. Doing so requires randomizing over all iterates, which is impractical in virtually any modern applications. Still, final iterates have been observed to perform well in practice. In this work, we address this gap between theory and practice by characterizing the constraint violation of Lagrangian minimizers associated with optimal dual variables, despite lack of convexity. To do this, we leverage the fact that non-convex, finite-dimensional constrained learning problems can be seen as parametrizations of convex, functional problems. Our results show that rich parametrizations effectively mitigate the issue of feasibility in dual methods, shedding light on prior empirical successes of dual learning. We illustrate our findings in fair learning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-body subnetworks (IBS) are envisioned to support reliable wireless connectivity for emerging applications including extended reality (XR) in the human body. As the deployment of in-body sub-networks is uncontrollable by nature, the dynamic radio resource allocation scheme in place becomes of the uttermost importance for the performance of the in-body sub-networks. This paper provides a comparative study on the performance of the state-of-the-art interference-aware sub-band allocation algorithms in in-body sub-networks supporting the XR applications. The study identified suitable models for characterizing in-body sub-networks which are used in a snapshot-based simulation framework to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of state-of-art sub-band allocation algorithms, including greedy selection, sequential greedy selection (SG), centralized graph coloring (CGC), and sequential iterative sub-band allocation (SISA). The study shows that for XR requirements, the SISA and SG algorithms can support IBS densities up to 75% higher than CGC.</description>

      <title>State space representations of the Roesser type for convolutional layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the perspective of control theory, convolutional layers (of neural networks) are 2-D (or N-D) linear time-invariant dynamical systems. The usual representation of convolutional layers by the convolution kernel corresponds to the representation of a dynamical system by its impulse response. However, many analysis tools from control theory, e.g., involving linear matrix inequalities, require a state space representation. For this reason, we explicitly provide a state space representation of the Roesser type for 2-D convolutional layers with $c_\mathrm{in}r_1 + c_\mathrm{out}r_2$ states, where $c_\mathrm{in}$/$c_\mathrm{out}$ is the number of input/output channels of the layer and $r_1$/$r_2$ characterizes the width/length of the convolution kernel. This representation is shown to be minimal for $c_\mathrm{in} = c_\mathrm{out}$. We further construct state space representations for dilated, strided, and N-D convolutions.</description>

Abstract: Integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance or monitoring applications into fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR) cellular networks is an intriguing problem that has recently tackled a lot of interest in both academia and industry. For an efficient spectrum usage, we consider a recently-proposed sky-ground nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, where a cellular-connected UAV acting as aerial user (AU) and a static terrestrial user (TU) are paired to simultaneously transmit their uplink signals to a base station (BS) in the same time-frequency resource blocks. In such a case, due to the highly dynamic nature of the UAV, the signal transmitted by the AU experiences both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by Doppler shifts. On the other hand, for a static ground network, frequency dispersion of the signal transmitted by the TU is negligible and only multipath effects have to be taken into account. To decode the superposed signals at the BS through successive interference cancellation, accurate estimates of both the AU and TU channels are needed. In this paper, we propose channel estimation procedures that suitably exploit the different circular/noncircular modulation formats (modulation diversity) and the different almost-cyclostationarity features (Doppler diversity) of the AU and TU by means of widely-linear time-varying processing. Our estimation approach is semi-blind since Doppler shifts and time delays of the AU are estimated based on the received data only, whereas the remaining relevant parameters of the AU and TU channels are acquired relying also on the available training symbols. Monte Carlo numerical results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation algorithms can satisfactorily acquire all the relevant parameters in different operative conditions.</description>

Abstract: In this work we introduce a convolution operation over the tangent bundle of Riemann manifolds in terms of exponentials of the Connection Laplacian operator. We define tangent bundle filters and tangent bundle neural networks (TNNs) based on this convolution operation, which are novel continuous architectures operating on tangent bundle signals, i.e. vector fields over the manifolds. Tangent bundle filters admit a spectral representation that generalizes the ones of scalar manifold filters, graph filters and standard convolutional filters in continuous time. We then introduce a discretization procedure, both in the space and time domains, to make TNNs implementable, showing that their discrete counterpart is a novel principled variant of the very recently introduced sheaf neural networks. We formally prove that this discretized architecture converges to the underlying continuous TNN. Finally, we numerically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture on various learning tasks, both on synthetic and real data.</description>

Abstract: The required signal processing rate in future wireless communication systems exceeds the performance of the latest electronics-based processors. Introduction of analog optical computation is one promising direction for energy-efficient processing. This paper considers a continuous-time minimum mean squared error detection for multiple-input multiple-output systems to realize signal detection using analog optical devices. The proposed method is formulated by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and its performance at any continuous time can be theoretically analyzed. Deriving and analyzing the continuous-time system is a meaningful step to verifying the feasibility of analog-domain signal processing in the future systems. In addition, considering such an ODE brings byproducts to discrete-time detection algorithms, which can be a novel methodology of algorithm construction and analysis.</description>

      <title>Respiratory Disease Classification and Biometric Analysis Using Biosignals from Digital Stethoscopes</title>

Abstract: Respiratory diseases remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the need for faster and more accurate diagnostic tools. This work presents a novel approach leveraging digital stethoscope technology for automatic respiratory disease classification and biometric analysis. Our approach has the potential to significantly enhance traditional auscultation practices. By leveraging one of the largest publicly available medical database of respiratory sounds, we train machine learning models to classify various respiratory health conditions. Our method differs from conventional methods by using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and spectral analysis techniques to isolate clinically relevant biosignals embedded within acoustic data captured by digital stethoscopes. This approach focuses on information closely tied to cardiovascular and respiratory patterns within the acoustic data. Spectral analysis and filtering techniques isolate Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) strongly correlated with these physiological phenomena. These biosignals undergo a comprehensive feature extraction process for predictive modeling. These features then serve as input to train several machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks. Our approach achieves high accuracy in both binary classification (89% balanced accuracy for healthy vs. diseased) and multi-class classification (72% balanced accuracy for specific diseases like pneumonia and COPD). For the first time, this work introduces regression models capable of estimating age and body mass index (BMI) based solely on acoustic data, as well as a model for sex classification. Our findings underscore the potential of intelligent digital stethoscopes to significantly enhance assistive and remote diagnostic capabilities, contributing to advancements in digital health, telehealth, and remote patient monitoring.</description>

Abstract: Exploring the mutual benefit and reciprocity of sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) functions is fundamental to realizing deeper integration for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. This paper investigates a novel communication-assisted sensing (CAS) system within 6G perceptive networks, where the base station actively senses the targets through device-free wireless sensing and simultaneously transmits the estimated information to end-users. In such a CAS system, we first establish an optimal waveform design framework based on the rate-distortion (RD) and source-channel separation (SCT) theorems. After analyzing the relationships between the sensing distortion, coding rate, and communication channel capacity, we propose two distinct waveform design strategies in the scenario of target impulse response estimation. In the separated S\&amp;C waveforms scheme, we equivalently transform the original problem into a power allocation problem and develop a low-complexity one-dimensional search algorithm, shedding light on a notable power allocation tradeoff between the S\&amp;C waveform. In the dual-functional waveform scheme, we conceive a heuristic mutual information optimization algorithm for the general case, alongside a modified gradient projection algorithm tailored for the scenarios with independent sensing sub-channels. Additionally, we identify the presence of both subspace tradeoff and water-filling tradeoff in this scheme. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Channel Coding for Channel-Adaptive Digital Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel joint source-channel coding (JSCC) approach for channel-adaptive digital semantic communications. In semantic communication systems with digital modulation and demodulation, robust design of JSCC encoder and decoder becomes challenging not only due to the unpredictable dynamics of channel conditions but also due to diverse modulation orders. To address this challenge, we first develop a new demodulation method which assesses the uncertainty of the demodulation output to improve the robustness of the digital semantic communication system. We then devise a robust training strategy which enhances the robustness and flexibility of the JSCC encoder and decoder against diverse channel conditions and modulation orders. To this end, we model the relationship between the encoder's output and decoder's input using binary symmetric erasure channels and then sample the parameters of these channels from diverse distributions. We also develop a channel-adaptive modulation technique for an inference phase, in order to reduce the communication latency while maintaining task performance. In this technique, we adaptively determine modulation orders for the latent variables based on channel conditions. Using simulations, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed JSCC approach for image classification, reconstruction, and retrieval tasks compared to existing JSCC approaches.</description>

      <title>Deep Regularized Compound Gaussian Network for Solving Linear Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporating prior information into inverse problems, e.g. via maximum-a-posteriori estimation, is an important technique for facilitating robust inverse problem solutions. In this paper, we devise two novel approaches for linear inverse problems that permit problem-specific statistical prior selections within the compound Gaussian (CG) class of distributions. The CG class subsumes many commonly used priors in signal and image reconstruction methods including those of sparsity-based approaches. The first method developed is an iterative algorithm, called generalized compound Gaussian least squares (G-CG-LS), that minimizes a regularized least squares objective function where the regularization enforces a CG prior. G-CG-LS is then unrolled, or unfolded, to furnish our second method, which is a novel deep regularized (DR) neural network, called DR-CG-Net, that learns the prior information. A detailed computational theory on convergence properties of G-CG-LS and thorough numerical experiments for DR-CG-Net are provided. Due to the comprehensive nature of the CG prior, these experiments show that DR-CG-Net outperforms competitive prior art methods in tomographic imaging and compressive sensing, especially in challenging low-training scenarios.</description>

      <title>Resonant Inductive Coupling Network for Human-Sized Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Magnetic Particle Imaging, a field-free region is maneuvered throughout the field of view using a time-varying magnetic field known as the drive-field. Human-sized systems operate the drive-field in the kHz range and generate it by utilizing strong currents that can rise to the kA range within a coil called the drive field generator. Matching and tuning between a power amplifier, a band-pass filter and the drive-field generator is required. Here, for reasons of safety in future human scanners, a symmetrical topology and a transformer, called inductive coupling network is used. Our primary objectives are to achieve floating potentials to ensure patient safety, attaining high linearity and high gain for the resonant transformer. We present a novel systematic approach to the design of a loss-optimized resonant toroid with a D-shaped cross section, employing segmentation to adjust the inductance-to-resistance ratio while maintaining a constant quality factor. Simultaneously, we derive a specific matching condition of a symmetric transmit-receive circuit for magnetic particle imaging. The chosen setup filters the fundamental frequency and allows simultaneous signal transmission and reception. In addition, the decoupling of multiple drive field channels is discussed and the primary side of the transformer is evaluated for maximum coupling and minimum stray field. Two prototypes were constructed, measured, decoupled, and compared to the derived theory and to method-of-moment based simulations.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Modeling for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empowered by the latest progress on innovative metamaterials/metasurfaces and advanced antenna technologies, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (H-MIMO) emerges as a promising technology to fulfill the extreme goals of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. The antenna arrays utilized in H-MIMO comprise massive (possibly to extreme extent) numbers of antenna elements, densely spaced less than half-a-wavelength and integrated into a compact space, realizing an almost continuous aperture. Thanks to the expected low cost, size, weight, and power consumption, such apertures are expected to be largely fabricated for near-field communications. In addition, the physical features of H-MIMO enable manipulations directly on the electromagnetic (EM) wave domain and spatial multiplexing. To fully leverage this potential, near-field H-MIMO channel modeling, especially from the EM perspective, is of paramount significance. In this article, we overview near-field H-MIMO channel models elaborating on the various modeling categories and respective features, as well as their challenges and evaluation criteria. We also present EM-domain channel models that address the inherit computational and measurement complexities. Finally, the article is concluded with a set of future research directions on the topic.</description>

      <title>On Large-Scale Multiple Testing Over Networks: An Asymptotic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work concerns developing communication- and computation-efficient methods for large-scale multiple testing over networks, which is of interest to many practical applications. We take an asymptotic approach and propose two methods, proportion-matching and greedy aggregation, tailored to distributed settings. The proportion-matching method achieves the global BH performance yet only requires a one-shot communication of the (estimated) proportion of true null hypotheses as well as the number of p-values at each node. By focusing on the asymptotic optimal power, we go beyond the BH procedure by providing an explicit characterization of the asymptotic optimal solution. This leads to the greedy aggregation method that effectively approximates the optimal rejection regions at each node, while computation efficiency comes from the greedy-type approach naturally. Moreover, for both methods, we provide the rate of convergence for both the FDR and power. Extensive numerical results over a variety of challenging settings are provided to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Capacity Gains in MIMO Systems with Few-Bit ADCs Using Nonlinear Analog Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) are a major contributor to the power consumption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers with large antenna arrays operating in the millimeter wave carrier frequencies. This is especially the case in large bandwidth communication systems, due to the sudden drop in energy-efficiency of ADCs as the sampling rate is increased above 100MHz. Two mitigating energy-efficient approaches which have received significant recent interest are i) to reduce the number of ADCs via analog and hybrid beamforming architectures, and ii) to reduce the resolution of the ADCs which in turn decreases power consumption. However, decreasing the number and resolution of ADCs leads to performance loss -- in terms of achievable rates -- due to increased quantization error. In this work, we study the application of practically implementable nonlinear analog operators such as envelope detectors and polynomial operators, prior to sampling and quantization at the ADCs, as a way to mitigate the aforementioned rate-loss. A receiver architecture consisting of linear analog combiners, nonlinear analog operators, and few-bit ADCs is designed. The fundamental information theoretic performance limits of the resulting communication system, in terms of achievable rates, are investigated under various assumptions on the set of implementable analog operators. Extensive numerical evaluations and simulations of the communication system are provided to compare the set of achievable rates under different architecture designs and parameters. Circuit simulations and measurement results, based on both 22 nm FDSOI CMOS technology and 65 nm Bulk CMOS transistor technologies, are provided to justify the power efficiency of the proposed receiver architecture deploying envelope detectors and polynomial operators.</description>

      <title>Open RAN-empowered V2X Architecture: Challenges, Opportunities, and Research Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advances in the automotive industry with the ever-increasing request for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are pushing for a new epoch of networked wireless systems. Vehicular communications, or Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), are expected to be among the main actors of the future beyond 5G and 6G networks. However, the challenging application requirements, the fast variability of the vehicular environment, and the harsh propagation conditions of high frequencies call for sophisticated control mechanisms to ensure the success of such a disruptive technology. While traditional Radio Access Networks (RAN) lack the flexibility to support the required control primitives, the emergent concept of Open RAN (O-RAN) appears as an ideal enabler of V2X communication orchestration. However, how to effectively integrate the two ecosystems is still an open issue. In this paper, we discuss possible integration strategies, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of leveraging ORAN to enable real-time V2X control. Additionally, we enrich our discussion with potential research directions stemming from the current state-of-the-art and we provide preliminary simulation results that validate the effectiveness of the proposed integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (deep NMF) has recently emerged as a valuable technique for extracting multiple layers of features across different scales. However, all existing deep NMF models and algorithms have primarily centered their evaluation on the least squares error, which may not be the most appropriate metric for assessing the quality of approximations on diverse datasets. For instance, when dealing with data types such as audio signals and documents, it is widely acknowledged that $\beta$-divergences offer a more suitable alternative. In this paper, we develop new models and algorithms for deep NMF using some $\beta$-divergences, with a focus on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Subsequently, we apply these techniques to the extraction of facial features, the identification of topics within document collections, and the identification of materials within hyperspectral images.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Forced Oscillation Localization using Inferred Impulse Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poorly damped oscillations pose threats to the stability and reliability of interconnected power systems. In this work, we propose a comprehensive data-driven framework for inferring the sources of forced oscillation (FO) using solely synchrophasor measurements. During normal grid operations, fast-rate ambient data are collected to recover the impulse responses in the small-signal regime, without requiring the system model. When FO events occur, the source is estimated based on the frequency domain analysis by fitting the least-squares (LS) error for the FO data using the impulse responses recovered previously. Although the proposed framework is purely data-driven, the result has been established theoretically via model-based analysis of linearized dynamics under a few realistic assumptions. Numerical validations demonstrate its applicability to realistic power systems including nonlinear, higher-order dynamics with control effects using the IEEE 68-bus system, and the 240-bus system from the IEEE-NASPI FO source location contest. The generalizability of the proposed methodology has been validated using different types of measurements and partial sensor coverage conditions.</description>

      <title>MAINS: A Magnetic Field Aided Inertial Navigation System for Indoor Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Magnetic field Aided Inertial Navigation System (MAINS) for indoor navigation is proposed in this paper. MAINS leverages an array of magnetometers to measure spatial variations in the magnetic field, which are then used to estimate the displacement and orientation changes of the system, thereby aiding the inertial navigation system (INS). Experiments show that MAINS significantly outperforms the stand-alone INS, demonstrating a remarkable two orders of magnitude reduction in position error. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art magnetic-field-aided navigation approach, the proposed method exhibits slightly improved horizontal position accuracy. On the other hand, it has noticeably larger vertical error on datasets with large magnetic field variations. However, one of the main advantages of MAINS compared to the state-of-the-art is that it enables flexible sensor configurations. The experimental results show that the position error after 2 minutes of navigation in most cases is less than 3 meters when using an array of 30 magnetometers. Thus, the proposed navigation solution has the potential to solve one of the key challenges faced with current magnetic-field simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solutions: the very limited allowable length of the exploration phase during which unvisited areas are mapped.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a user equipment (UE) and a beam for each access point (AP) for concurrent transmissions in a millimeter wave (mmWave) network, such that the sum of weighted rates of UEs is maximized. We prove that this problem is NP-complete. We propose two algorithms -- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based and local interaction game (LIG) based UE and beam selection -- and prove that both of them asymptotically achieve the optimal solution. Also, we propose two fast greedy algorithms -- NGUB1 and NGUB2 -- for UE and beam selection. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed greedy algorithms outperform the most relevant algorithms proposed in prior work and perform close to the asymptotically optimal algorithms.</description>

      <title>Identification of Craving Maps among Marijuana Users via the Analysis of Functional Brain Networks with High-Order Attention Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The consumption of high doses of marijuana can have significant psychological and social impacts. In this study, we propose an interpretable framework called the HOGANN (High-Order Graph Attention Neural Networks) for Marijuana addiction classification and followed by the analysis of the localized brain network communities that demonstrated abnormal brain activities among chronic marijuana users. The HOGANN integrates dynamic intrinsic functional brain networks estimated from the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to capture temporal network dynamics. We employed an high-order attention module for information fusion and message passing among the neighboring nodes, enhancing the network community level analysis. We validated our model on two data cohorts and the overall classification for both dataset have achieved a much higher accuracy than the comparison algorithms. In addition, we identified the most relevant subnetworks and cognitive regions which are impacted by persistent marijuana consumption, suggesting that chronic marijuana consumption can adversely affect functional brain networks, particularly within the Dorsal Attention and Frontoparietal networks. Most interestingly, we found our model performs better on the cohorts of subjects with long time dependence, which suggests longer time consumption of marijuana brings more significant changes of brain networks. The model can identify craving brain maps, and thus pinpointing brain regions that are important for analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The utilization of distributed arithmetic (DA) in AF algorithms has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance computational efficiency and reduce resource requirements. This paper presents an exploration of the application of DA to adaptive filtering (AF) algorithms, analyzing trends, discussing challenges, and outlining future prospects. It begins by providing an overview of both DA and AF algorithms, highlighting their individual merits and established applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new six-dimensional (6D) movable antenna (6DMA) system for future wireless networks to improve the communication performance. Unlike the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and existing fluid antenna/two-dimensional (2D) movable antenna (FA/2DMA) systems that adjust the positions of antennas only, the proposed 6DMA system consists of distributed antenna surfaces with independently adjustable three-dimensional (3D) positions as well as 3D rotations within a given space. In particular, this paper applies the 6DMA to the base station (BS) in wireless networks to provide full degrees of freedom (DoFs) for the BS to adapt to the dynamic user spatial distribution in the network. However, a challenging new problem arises on how to optimally control the 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces at the BS to maximize the network capacity based on the user spatial distribution, subject to the practical constraints on 6D antennas' movement. To tackle this problem, we first model the 6DMA-enabled BS and the user channels with the BS in terms of 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces. Next, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to search for the best 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces by leveraging the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Specifically, we sequentially optimize the 3D position/3D rotation of each 6DMA surface with those of the other surfaces fixed in an iterative manner. Numerical results show that our proposed 6DMA-BS can significantly improve the network capacity as compared to the benchmark BS architectures with FPAs or 6DMAs with limited/partial movability, especially when the user distribution is more spatially non-uniform.</description>
