      <title>Interior of certain sums and continuous images of very thin Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for all Cantor set $K_1$ on ${\mathbb R}^d$, it is always possible to find another Cantor set $K_2$ so that the sum $g(K_1)+ K_2$ (where $g$ is a $C^1$ local diffeomorphism) has non-empty interior, and the existence of the interior is robust under small perturbation of the mapping. More generally, we can also show that the image set $H(\alpha, K_1,K_2)$, where $H$ is some $C^1$ function on ${\mathbb R}^N\times{\mathbb R}^d\times{\mathbb R}^d$ with non-vanishing Jacobian, have non-empty interior for $\alpha$ all in an open ball of ${\mathbb R}^N$. This result allows us to show that all Cantor sets are not topologically universal using $C^1$ local diffeomorphism, proving a stronger version of the topological Erd\H{o}s similarity conjecture. Moreover, we are also able to construct a Cantor set of dimension $d$ on ${\mathbb R}^{2d}$, whose distance set has an interior.</description>

      <title>Improved stability versions of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of stability for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality. Exploiting properties of the transport map between radially decreasing functions and a suitable functional version of the trace inequality, we obtain a uniform stability exponent for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality.
  Our result yields an exponent not only uniform in the dimension but also in the log-concavity parameter $\tau = \min(\lambda,1-\lambda)$ associated with its respective version of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality. As a further application of our methods, we prove a sharp stability result for log-concave functions in dimension 1, which also extends to a sharp stability result for log-concave radial functions in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological Erd\H{o}s similarity conjecture and Strong Measure zero sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve the topological version of the Erd\H{o}s Similarity conjecture introduced previously by Gallagher, Lai and Weber. We show that a set is topologically universal on ${\mathbb R}$ if and only if it is of strong measure zero. As a result of the fact that the Borel conjecture is independent of the \textsf{ZFC} axiomatic set theory, the existence of an uncountable topologically universal set is independent of the \textsf{ZFC}. Moreover, our results can also be generalized to locally compact Polish groups ${\mathbb G}$. Returning to the measure side, we pose Full-Measure universal Erd\H{o}s Similarity Conjecture with strongly meager sets via the duality of measure and category.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the solution map for hyperbolic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic polynomials are monic real-rooted polynomials. By Bronshtein's theorem, the increasingly ordered roots of a hyperbolic polynomial of degree $d$ with $C^{d-1,1}$ coefficients are locally Lipschitz and this solution map ``coefficients-to-roots'' is bounded. We prove continuity of the solution map from hyperbolic polynomials of degree $d$ with $C^d$ coefficients to their increasingly ordered roots with respect to the $C^d$ structure on the source space and the Sobolev $W^{1,q}$ structure, for all $1 \le q&lt;\infty$, on the target space. Continuity fails for $q=\infty$. As a consequence, we obtain continuity of the local surface area of the roots.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of the solution map for polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we proved that the continuous roots of a monic polynomial of degree $d$ whose coefficients depend in a $C^{d-1,1}$ way on real parameters belong to the Sobolev space $W^{1,q}$ for all $1\le q&lt;d/(d-1)$. This is optimal. We obtained uniform bounds that show that the solution map ``coefficients-to-roots'' is bounded with respect to the $C^{d-1,1}$ and the Sobolev $W^{1,q}$ structures on source and target space, respectively. In this paper, we prove that the solution map is continuous, provided that we consider the $C^d$ structure on the space of coefficients. Since there is no canonical choice of an ordered $d$-tuple of the roots, we work in the space of $d$-valued Sobolev functions equipped with a strong notion of convergence. We also interpret the results in the Wasserstein space on the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Ball characterizations in planes and spaces of constant curvature, I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let us have in S^2, R^2 or H^2 a pair of convex bodies, for S^2 different from S^2, such that the intersections of any congruent copies of them are centrally symmetric. Then our bodies are congruent circles. If the intersections of any congruent copies of them are axially symmetric, then our bodies are circles.
  Let us have in S^2, R^2 or H^2 proper closed convex subsets K,L with interior points, such that the numbers of the connected components of the boundaries of K and L are finite. If the intersections of any congruent copies of K and L are centrally symmetric, then K and L are congruent circles, or, for R^2, parallel strips. We describe all pairs of such subsets K,L, whose any congruent copies have an intersection with axial symmetry. For S^2, R^2 and H^2 there are 1, 5 and 9 cases, resp.
  Let us have in S^d, R^d or H^d proper closed convex C^2_+ subsets K,L with interior points, such that all sufficiently small intersections of their congruent copies are symmetric w.r.t. a particular hyperplane. Then the boundary components of both K and L are congruent, and each of them is a sphere, a parasphere or a hypersphere.
  Let us have a pair of convex bodies in S^d, R^d or H^d, which have at any boundary points supporting spheres, for S^d of radius less than \pi/2. If the convex hull of the union of any congruent copies of these bodies is centrally symmetric, then our bodies are congruent balls, for S^d of radius less than \pi/2. An analogous statement holds for symmetry w.r.t. a particular hyperplane. For d=2 suppose the existence of the above supporting circles, for S^2 of radius less than \pi/2, and for S^2 smoothness of K and L. If we suppose axial symmetry of all the above convex hulls, then our bodies are circles, for S^2 of radii less than \pi/2.</description>

      <title>Riesz energies and the magnitude of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric significance of Leinster's magnitude invariant. For closed manifolds we find a precise relation with Brylinski's beta function and therefore with classical invariants of knots and submanifolds. In the special case of compact homogeneous spaces we obtain an elementary proof that the residues of the beta function contain the same geometric information as the asymptotic expansion of the magnitude function. For general closed manifolds we use the recent pseudodifferential analysis of the magnitude operator to relate these via an interpolating polynomial family. Beyond manifolds, the relation with the Brylinski beta function allows to deduce unexpected properties of the magnitude function for the $p$-adic integers.</description>
