      <title>Calibrating a Finite-strain Phase-field Model of Fracture for Bonded Granular Materials with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the mechanical behavior of mock high explosives, an experimental and simulation program was developed to calibrate, with quantified uncertainty, a material model of the bonded granular material Idoxuridine and nitroplasticized Estane-5703. This paper reports on the efficacy of such a framework as a generalizable methodology for calibrating material models against experimental data with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, this paper studies the effect of two manufacturing temperatures and three initial granular configurations on the unconfined compressive behavior of the resulting bonded granular materials. In each of these cases, the same calibration framework was used; in that, hundreds of high-fidelity direct numerical simulations using a new, GPU-enabled, high-performance finite element method software, Ratel, were run to calibrate a finite-strain phase-field fracture model against experimental data. It was found that manufacturing temperature influenced the elastic response of the mock high explosives, with higher temperatures yielding a stiffer response. By contrast, it was found that the initial configuration of the grains had a negligible impact on the overall behavior of the mock high explosives, though it remains possible that local damage accumulation within the specimens could be altered by the initial configurations. Overall, the calibration framework was successful at creating well-calibrated models, showing its usefulness as an engineering and scientific tool.</description>

      <title>A Phase Field Formulation of Frictional Sliding Contact for 3D Fully Eulerian Fluid Structure Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frictional sliding contact in hydrodynamic environments can be found in a range of engineering applications. Accurate modeling requires an integrated numerical framework capable of resolving large relative motions, multiphase interactions, and nonlinear contact responses. Building on our previously developed fully Eulerian fluid structure formulation, we introduce a phase field based formulation for dynamic frictional contact in 3D. Contact detection is achieved via the overlap of diffuse interfaces of colliding solids. The normal contact response is defined as a volumetric body force proportional to the overlap parameter, while the tangential response is computed using the Coulomb friction model. The direction of the friction forces are derived by projecting phase-averaged relative velocities onto the local tangent plane of colliding bodies. This proposed unified treatment enables the computation of both normal and frictional forces within a single momentum balance equation, avoiding separate velocity fields for individual solids. We present several test cases with increasing complexity to verify and demonstrate our proposed frictional contact model. Verification against the Hertzian contact problem shows excellent agreement with the analytical solution, with errors below $3\%$ in the traction profile. In the sliding block benchmark, the computed displacement profiles closely follow the analytical solution for point-mass systems across multiple friction coefficients. The ironing problem demonstrates stable force predictions under finite deformation, with normal and tangential forces matching kinetic friction laws. The robustness and scalability of the proposed formulation are further demonstrated through a representative ship ice interaction scenario with free surface and frictional sliding effects.</description>

      <title>Automated training of neural-network interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) have transformed atomistic simulations, by enabling molecular dynamics simulations with near ab initio accuracy at reduced computational costs and improved scalability. Despite these advances, crafting NNIPs remains complex, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs. Our approach integrates density-functional theory, data augmentation strategies and classical molecular dynamics to systematically explore the potential energy landscape. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against true errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of our active learning strategy, which is shown to minimize both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to relabel with ab initio calculations. The method is validated on the fully automated training of a NNIP for a diverse set of carbon allotropes, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency. This platform democratizes NNIP development, empowering users to achieve high-precision simulations with minimal human intervention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conservative-dissipative dynamics are ubiquitous across a variety of complex open systems. We propose a data-driven two-phase method, the Moment-DeepRitz Method, for learning drift decompositions in generalized diffusion systems involving conservative-dissipative dynamics. The method is robust to noisy data, adaptable to rough potentials and oscillatory rotations. We demonstrate its effectiveness through several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Limits of Graph Neural Networks for Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium Prediction: A Cryogenic Mixture Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and fast thermophysical models are needed to embed vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations in design, optimization, and control loops for cryogenic mixtures. This study asks whether a structure-aware graph neural network (GNN; DimeNet++) trained on GERG-2008/CoolProp data can act as a practical surrogate for an equation of state (EoS). We generate a ternary dataset over 90-200 K and pressures to 100 bar, curate it with a 15% density filter (reducing 5,200 states to 1,516), and pair each state with a lightweight molecular-dynamics snapshot to supply structural features. The model is trained in two stages; pretraining on residual Helmholtz energy followed by pressure fine-tuning with a stability penalty; and evaluated via single-phase interpolation tests, solver-free derivative-quality diagnostics, an audited VLE driver, and a latency benchmark. Within its regime, the GNN interpolates single-phase properties reasonably well; however, the VLE driver accepts no GNN equilibria on tested binaries (all plotted VLE points are CoolProp fallback or the solver fails), and diagnostic probes reveal jagged P(V|T) paths and thermal-stability flags concentrated in dense/cold regions, indicating insufficient derivative smoothness/consistency for robust equilibrium solving. An end-to-end timing comparison shows no single-phase speed advantage relative to CoolProp (tens of milliseconds vs sub-millisecond). We conclude that, as configured, the surrogate in this study is not solver-ready for VLE and offers no runtime benefit; its value is methodological, delineating failure modes and pointing to remedies such as physics-informed training signals and targeted coverage near phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>M4GN: Mesh-based Multi-segment Hierarchical Graph Network for Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective surrogates for PDE simulations, yet their deep message passing incurs high cost and over-smoothing on large, long-range meshes; hierarchical GNNs shorten propagation paths but still face two key obstacles: (i) building coarse graphs that respect mesh topology, geometry, and physical discontinuities, and (ii) maintaining fine-scale accuracy without sacrificing the speed gained from coarsening. We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric hierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that pairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by modal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically consistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant aggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation approaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level GNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons efficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency. Evaluated on multiple representative benchmark datasets, M4GN improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster inference than state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a mathematical analysis of time-dependent $N$-body electronic systems and establish mixed regularity for the corresponding wavefunctions. Based on this, we develop sparse grid approximations to reduce computational complexity, including a sparse grid Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) scheme. We validate the approach on the Helium atom (${\rm He}$) and Hydrogen molecule (${\rm H}_2$), showing that sparse grid GTOs offer an efficient alternative to full grid discretizations.</description>

      <title>Practical Routing and Criticality in Large-Scale Quantum Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of a communication network hinges upon both its physical architecture and the protocols that are employed within it. In the context of quantum communications, there exists a fundamental rate-loss tradeoff for point-to-point quantum channels such that the rate for distributing entanglement, secret keys, or quantum states decays exponentially with respect to transmission distance. Quantum networks are the solution to overcome point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks. Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated with large-scale quantum networks. Our work reveals the weaknesses of applying single-path routing protocols within quantum networks, observing an inability to achieve reliable rates over long distances. Adapting novel algorithms for multi-path routing, we employ an efficient and practical multi-path routing algorithm capable of boosting performance while minimizing costly quantum resources.</description>

      <title>A time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral method for the Wigner(-Poisson)-Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose an efficient time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral method for the Wigner(-Poisson)-Fokker-Planck equations. The method achieves second-order accuracy in time and spectral accuracy in phase space, both of which are rigorously verified by numerical experiments. The validated scheme is then employed to study the long-time dynamics of these systems. We investigate the existence of steady states for both the Wigner-Fokker-Planck and Wigner-Poisson-Fokker-Planck equations. Notably, for the Wigner-Fokker-Planck system, our results provide numerical evidence for the existence of a steady state even when the external potential is far from harmonic. This is an important discovery, since this phenomenon has not been thoroughly established in theory.</description>

      <title>PINGS: Physics-Informed Neural Network for Fast Generative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PINGS (Physics-Informed Neural Network for Fast Generative Sampling), a framework that amortizes diffusion sampling by training a physics-informed network to approximate reverse-time probability-flow dynamics, reducing sampling to a single forward pass (NFE = 1). As a proof of concept, we learn a direct map from a 3D standard normal to a non-Gaussian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). PINGS preserves the target's distributional structure (multi-bandwidth kernel $MMD^2 = 1.88 \times 10^{-2}$ with small errors in mean, covariance, skewness, and excess kurtosis) and achieves constant-time generation: $10^4$ samples in $16.54 \pm 0.56$ millisecond on an RTX 3090, versus 468-843 millisecond for DPM-Solver (10/20) and 960 millisecond for DDIM (50) under matched conditions. We also sanity-check the PINN/automatic-differentiation pipeline on a damped harmonic oscillator, obtaining MSEs down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. Compared to fast but iterative ODE solvers and direct-map families (Flow, Rectified-Flow, Consistency), PINGS frames generative sampling as a PINN-style residual problem with endpoint anchoring, yielding a white-box, differentiable map with NFE = 1. These proof-of-concept results position PINGS as a promising route to fast, function-based generative sampling with potential extensions to scientific simulation (e.g., fast calorimetry).</description>

      <title>Requirements for Early Quantum Advantage and Quantum Utility in the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a transparent, encoding-agnostic framework for determining when the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) can achieve early quantum advantage. Our analysis shows this is unlikely on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware even in best case scenarios that use the most qubit-efficient direct encodings. Closed-form resource counts, combined with recent device benchmarks, yield three decisive go/no-go figures of merit: the quantum feasibility point and the qubit- and gate-feasibility lines, which place any CVRP instance on a single decision diagram. Contrasting a direct QUBO mapping with a space-efficient higher-order (HOBO) encoding reveals a large gap. Applied to early-advantage benchmarks such as Golden-5, our diagram shows that HOBO circuits require only 7,685 qubits, whereas comparable QUBO encodings still exceed 200,000 qubits. In addition to identifying candidate instances for early quantum advantage in CVRP, the framework provides a unifying go/no-go metric that ingests any CVRP encoding together with any hardware profile and highlights when quantum devices could challenge classical heuristics. Quantum advantage in CVRP would likely require innovative problem decomposition techniques.</description>

      <title>Oscillating Heat Transfer Prediction in Porous Structures Using Generative AI-Assisted Explainable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and interpreting thermal performance under oscillating flow in porous structures remains a critical challenge due to the complex coupling between fluid dynamics and geometric features. This study introduces a data-driven wGAN-LBM-Nested_CV framework that integrates generative deep learning, numerical simulation based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), and interpretable machine learning to predict and explain the thermal behavior in such systems. A wide range of porous structures with diverse topologies were synthesized using a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (wGAN-GP), significantly expanding the design space. High-fidelity thermal data were then generated through LBM simulations across various Reynolds (Re) and Strouhal numbers (St). Among several machine learning models evaluated via nested cross-validation and Bayesian optimization, XGBoost achieved the best predictive performance for the average Nusselt number (Nu) (R^2=0.9981). Model interpretation using SHAP identified the Reynolds number, Strouhal number, porosity, specific surface area, and pore size dispersion as the most influential predictors, while also revealing synergistic interactions among them. Threshold-based insights, including Re &gt; 75 and porosity &gt; 0.6256, provide practical guidance for enhancing convective heat transfer. This integrated approach delivers both quantitative predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering actionable guidelines for designing porous media with improved thermal performance under oscillatory flow conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the environmental interactions of quantum systems is a critical bottleneck in the development of robust quantum technologies. Traditional tomographic methods are often data-intensive and struggle with scalability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for performing Lindblad tomography using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). By embedding the Lindblad master equation directly into the neural network's loss function, our approach simultaneously learns the quantum state's evolution and infers the underlying dissipation parameters from sparse, time-series measurement data. Our results show that PINNs can reconstruct both the system dynamics and the functional form of unknown noise parameters, presenting a sample-efficient and scalable solution for quantum device characterization. Ultimately, our method produces a fully-differentiable digital twin of a noisy quantum system by learning its governing master equation.</description>

      <title>Predicting Structural Relaxation in Supercooled Small Molecules via Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Microscopic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of small organic molecules is critical for applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to energy and food preservation. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that combines molecular dynamics simulations and Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the structural relaxation behavior of small organic glass-formers. By using propanol, glucose, fructose, and trehalose as model systems, we estimate the glass transition temperature (Tg) from stepwise cooling simulations and volume-temperature analysis. These computed Tg values are then inserted into the ECNLE theory to calculate temperature-dependent relaxation times and diffusion coefficients. Numerical results agree well with experimental data in prior works. This approach provides a predictive and experimentally-independent route for characterizing glassy dynamics in molecular materials.</description>

      <title>Power Laws for the Thermal Slip Length of a Liquid/Solid Interface From the Structure and Frequency Response of the Contact Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's powerful integrated chips for information processing, computer graphics and visualization generate so much heat that liquid based cooling is now indispensable to prevent breakdown from thermal runaway effects. While thermal convection schemes using two-phase cooling in microfluidic networks or liquid immersion are proving effective, further progress requires tackling the intrinsic thermal resistance of a liquid/solid (L/S) interface, quantified by the thermal slip length. Theoretical models and experimental tools for estimating this length have been developed for superfluid/metal interfaces but no comparable tools exist for systems at non-cryogenic temperatures. Researchers have therefore come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to understand the influence of various parameters. But despite considerable effort, no actual relations have been proposed. Our study of 180 systems describing a liquid layer confined between identical crystals at different temperatures highlights the influence of correlated behavior throughout the L/S contact zone. When rescaled by key variables in the zone, the data for the thermal slip length exhibit excellent collapse onto two power law relations dependent on the peak value of the in-plane structure factor of the first liquid layer and the ratio of dominant frequencies pegged to the maxima in the vibrational density of states of the first liquid and solid layer. We hope that this perspective, which highlights the critical role of surface localized phonons in L/S systems, can now better guide development of analytic models and de novo interface designs for minimizing thermal slip.</description>

      <title>PYSED: A tool for extracting kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and lifetime from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy of thermal transport properties across diverse materials. However, extracting phonon-mode-resolved insights from these simulations remains a critical challenge. Here, we introduce PYSED, a Python-based package built on the spectral energy density (SED) method, designed to efficiently compute kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and extract phonon lifetime from large-scale MD simulation trajectories. By integrating high-accuracy machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models, we validate and showcase the effectiveness of the implemented SED method across systems of varying dimensionalities. Specifically, the NEP-driven MD-SED accurately reveals how phonon modes are affected by strain in carbon nanotubes, as well as by interlayer coupling strengths and the twist angles in two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide. For three-dimensional systems, the SED method effectively establishes the thermal transport regime diagram for metal-organic frameworks, distinguishing between particlelike and wavelike propagation regions. Moreover, using bulk silicon as an example, we show that phonon SED can efficiently capture quantum dynamics based on path-integral trajectories. The PYSED package bridges MD simulations with detailed phonon-mode insights, delivering a robust tool for investigating thermal transport properties with detailed mechanisms across various materials.</description>

      <title>How to simulate L\'evy flights in a steep potential: An explicit splitting numerical scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed L\'evy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions.
  In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions.
  This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of L\'evy flights in steep potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>Spectral density characteristics of self-organized structuring in phase-synchronized oscillator ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of coherent structures in developed turbulence can be described as a self-organization process, where macroscopic order emerges from a chaotic background through nonequilibrium phase transitions. We model this mechanism by simulating an ensemble of locally coupled classical oscillators, representing the oscillatory modes of fluctuation within a turbulent medium, which synchronize via a propagating Kuramoto-like interaction field. Upon synchronization, the system spontaneously self-organizes into dense structures, and we demonstrate a tendency for those structures to form quantized loop currents of phase information. These currents are governed by topological constraints that arise from statistical instabilities within the system's oscillatory interaction network. We show that the power spectral density of these emergent structures exhibits a stable, universal power-law behaviour, with spectral indices characteristic of natural plasma turbulence. These findings suggest that the statistical markers of turbulence can arise from universal principles of topological self-organization, independent of the system's specific physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Data-Induced Interactions of Sparse Sensors Using Statistical Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-dimensional empirical data in science and engineering frequently have a low-rank structure and can be represented as a combination of just a few eigenmodes. Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm that outputs a single "optimal" sensor configuration, we take a statistical mechanics view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. The two key advances of this paper are the recasting of the sensor placement landscape in an Ising model form and a regularized reconstruction that significantly decreases reconstruction error for few sensors. In addition, we provide first uncertainty quantification of the sparse sensing reconstruction and open questions about the shape of reconstruction risk curve. Mapping out these data-induced sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and anticipating sensor replacement impacts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of spin-glass dynamics, long considered the paradigmatic complex system, has reached important milestones. The availability of single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative dynamical descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change $\unicode{x2013}$including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory$\unicode{x2013}$ are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of generation of bound states in the continuum via single-photon scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits when the distance between the qubits gives rise to non-negligible photon delays (non-Markovian regime). The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include such photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics hence identifying optimal working points for the BIC generation.</description>

      <title>Learning non-ideal genuine network nonlocality using causally inferred Bayesian neural network algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the characterization of genuine network nonlocal correlations, which remains highly challenging due to the non-convex nature of local correlations even in the simplest scenario, and increasingly so when derived from entangled states that deviate from their ideal forms. We introduce a scalable causally-inferred Bayesian learning framework called the LHV layered neural network, which introduces the rank parameter of the non-ideal combined source state as an untapped resource to learn the local statistics in Bell tests. This reveals these correlations to persist close to the Bell states, with a noise robustness of 0.94-0.95 in the triangle scenario, additionally requiring all sources to send only entangled states with joint entangled measurements as resources. Further, we study the robustness of the genuineness to shared randomness in the network scenario. Apart from the results, the work succeeds in showing that machine learning approaches with foundational domain-specific constraints can greatly benefit the field of quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Growth Regime Shifts in Empirical Networks: Evidence and Challenges from the Software Heritage and APS Citation Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale growing network linking software releases and revisions from open-source communities. The network spans over 40 years and includes about 6 billion nodes and edges. Our analysis relies on natural temporal and topological partitions of nodes and edges.
  A derived temporalized graph reveals a bow-tie-like structure and enables study of edge dynamics -- creation, inheritance, and aging -- together with comparisons to minimal models. In- and out-degree distributions and edge timestamp histograms expose regime shifts linked to changes in developer practices, notably in the average number of edges per new node.
  Without presupposing its validity, we estimate the scaling exponent under the scale-free hypothesis. Results highlight the sensitivity of a widely used estimation method to regime changes and outliers, while showing that partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects.
  We extend the analysis to the APS citation network, which also exhibits a major regime shift around 1985, though driven by distinct factors. Both cases illustrate how structural and dynamical transitions complicate conclusions about the existence and observability of a scale-free regime. These findings underscore the need for refined tools to study transient growth phases and to enable robust comparisons between empirical growing networks and minimal models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensional analysis is one of the most fundamental tools for understanding physical systems. However, the construction of dimensionless variables, as guided by the Buckingham-$\pi$ theorem, is not uniquely determined. Here, we introduce IT-$\pi$, a model-free method that combines dimensionless learning with the principles of information theory. Grounded in the irreducible error theorem, IT-$\pi$ identifies dimensionless variables with the highest predictive power by measuring their shared information content. The approach is able to rank variables by predictability, identify distinct physical regimes, uncover self-similar variables, determine the characteristic scales of the problem, and extract its dimensionless parameters. IT-$\pi$ also provides a bound of the minimum predictive error achievable across all possible models, from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning techniques, naturally enabling a definition of model efficiency. We benchmark IT-$\pi$ across different cases and demonstrate that it offers superior performance and capabilities compared to existing tools. The method is also applied to conduct dimensionless learning for supersonic turbulence, aerodynamic drag on both smooth and irregular surfaces, magnetohydrodynamic power generation, and laser-metal interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chaotic dynamics of small-scale vorticity plays a key role in understanding and controlling turbulence, with direct implications for energy transfer, mixing, and coherent structure evolution. However, measuring or controlling its dynamics remains a major conceptual and experimental challenge due to its transient and chaotic nature. Here we use a combination of experiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of different densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics, can act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its smallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally controllable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale turbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology. Notably, we present the first observation of stochastic resonance for particles in turbulence: turbulent fluctuations, effectively acting as noise, counterintuitively enhance the particle rotational response to external forcing. We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational phase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity of small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking mechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity remarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean vorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in "surfing" the magnetic field. Our findings offer insights into flexible particle manipulation in complex flows and open up a novel magnetic resonance-based approach for measuring vorticity: magnetic particles as probes emit detectable magnetic fields, enabling turbulence quantification even under optically-inaccessible conditions.</description>

      <title>QUEST: QUantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.</description>

      <title>Potential failures of physics-informed machine learning in traffic flow modeling: theoretical and experimental analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates why physics-informed machine learning (PIML) can fail in macroscopic traffic flow modeling. We define failure as cases where a PIML model underperforms both purely data-driven and purely physics-based baselines by a given threshold. Unlike in other fields, physics residuals themselves do not hinder optimization in this setting. Instead, effective updates require both data and physics gradients to form acute angles with the true gradient, a condition difficult to satisfy with low-resolution loop data. In such cases, neural networks cannot accurately approximate density and speed, and the constructed physics residuals, already degraded by discrete sampling and temporal averaging, lose their ability to capture PDE dynamics, which directly leads to PIML failure. Theoretically, although LWR and ARZ solutions are weak solutions, for piecewise $C^k$ initial data they remain $C^k$ off the shock set under mild conditions, which has Lebesgue measure zero. Thus, almost all detector or collocation points lie in smooth regions where residuals are valid, and the MLP's inability to exactly represent discontinuities is immaterial. Finally, we establish MSE lower bounds of physics residuals: higher-order models such as ARZ have strictly larger consistency error bounds than LWR under mild conditions. This explains why LWR-based PIML can outperform ARZ-based PIML even with high-resolution data, with the gap shrinking as resolution increases, consistent with prior empirical findings.</description>

      <title>Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets</title>

Abstract: In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches forming a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomenon is explained by a double-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O and V2Te2O/ZnSe/V2Te2O AMTJs. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</description>

      <title>More sophisticated is not always better: comparison of similarity measures for unsupervised learning of pathways in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</description>

      <title>Ising energy model for the stochastic prediction of tumor islets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20804</link>

Abstract: A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
  This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move, duplicate, or die.
  The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that captures correlations between neighboring cells.
  The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
  The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape, correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
  This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
  The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.</description>

      <title>Quantifying model prediction sensitivity to model-form uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-form uncertainty (MFU) in assumptions made during physics-based model development is widely considered a significant source of uncertainty; however, there are limited approaches that can quantify MFU in predictions extrapolating beyond available data. As a result, it is challenging to know how important MFU is in practice, especially relative to other sources of uncertainty in a model, making it difficult to prioritize resources and efforts to drive down error in model predictions. To address these challenges, we present a novel method to quantify the importance of uncertainties associated with model assumptions. We combine parameterized modifications to assumptions (called MFU representations) with grouped variance-based sensitivity analysis to measure the importance of assumptions. We demonstrate how, in contrast to existing methods addressing MFU, our approach can be applied without access to calibration data. However, if calibration data is available, we demonstrate how it can be used to inform the MFU representation, and how variance-based sensitivity analysis can be meaningfully applied even in the presence of dependence between parameters (a common byproduct of calibration).</description>

      <title>Electronic order induced symmetry breaking in lattice dynamics of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the molecular Berry curvature (MBC) framework, we develop an \textit{ab initio} algorithm to capture the quantitative effects of magnetic order on lattice dynamics. Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term that breaks both time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving rise to significant off-$\Gamma$ effects. Our results show the phonon splitting of the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes have distinct origins: the $E_g$ splitting arises from MBC and is captured by our algorithm, while the $E_u$ splitting stems from correlation-sensitive Fano resonance, explaining their asymmetric experimental line shapes. We provide a design strategy and computational pathway for materials with large phonon magnetism and splitting, requiring SOC, electron-phonon coupling, and ideally flat bands at the Fermi level. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal phonon transport.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving High-Order Methods for the Compressible Euler Equations in Potential Temperature Formulation for Atmospheric Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable. We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.</description>
