      <title>A universal reconstruction method for X ray scattering tensor tomography based on wavefront modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a versatile method for full-field, X-ray scattering tensor tomography that is based on energy conservation and is applicable to data obtained using different wavefront modulators. Using this algorithm, we pave the way for speckle-based tensor tomography. The proposed model relies on a mathematical approach that allows tuning spatial resolution and signal sensitivity. We present the application of the algorithm to three different imaging modalities and demonstrate its potential for applications of X-ray directional dark-field imaging.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Applications of a Heralded Electron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically describe the noise properties of a heralded electron source made from a standard electron gun, a weak photonic coupler, a single photon counter, and an electron energy filter. We argue the traditional heralding figure of merit, the Klyshko efficiency, is an insufficient statistic for characterizing performance in dose-control and dose-limited applications. Instead, we describe the sub-Poissonian statistics of the source using the fractional reduction in variance and the fractional increase in Fisher Information. Using these figures of merit, we discuss the engineering requirements for efficient heralding and evaluate potential applications using simple models of electron lithography, bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (BFSTEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We find that the advantage in each of these applications is situational, but potentially significant: dynamic control of the trade-off between write speed and shot noise in electron lithography; an order of magnitude dose reduction in BFSTEM for thin samples (e.g. 2D materials); and a doubling of dose efficiency for wall-steepness estimation in SEM.</description>

      <title>Design of ANF/MXene/SSG sandwich structure with electromagnetic shielding performance and impact resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since entering the information era, electronic devices gradually play an important role in daily lives. However, the abuse of electronic devices leads to corresponding electromagnetic EM wave pollution. The complex external environment causes the potential for physical impact. In this work, an ANF MXene SSG flexible sandwich structure was fabricated according to methods of vacuum filtration, directional freeze-casting solidification, and polyurethane encapsulation. Apart from its excellent protection function, the sandwich structure also acts as a human body movement sensor.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrongly-coupled magnetochiral magnon-polaritons in metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon-polariton is a synthetic quasi-particle of quantized spinwaves in magnets coupled with photons. The recent reporting of ultrastrong photon-to-magnon coupling in magnetic heterostructures was demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures in terms of reciprocal electromagnetic responses. Here, we report that magnon-polaritons in a three-dimensional metamaterial lacking time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries -- magnetochiral magnon-polaritons -- demonstrate ultrastrong coupling and directional non-reciprocity at room temperature. Ultrastrong coupling is due to a direct coupling between microwave photons confined in the chiral meta-atom and magnons in the magnetic meta-atom. Our results reveal a crucial step in identifying cavity-free, deepstrongly-coupled, non-reciprocal magnon-polaritons for hybrid quantum systems and quasi-particle "chemistry" using metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Light-induced optical orientation of magnetic moments in transition-metal doped hybrid metal halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using optical orientation to manipulate magnetic moments in matter with light is a key objective in opto-spintronics, however, realizations of such control on ultrafast timescales are limited. Here, we report ultrafast optical control of magnetic moment orientation in magnetically doped metal halide perovskites. Employing intense pulses of circularly polarized light, we inject populations of spin-polarized charge carriers in pristine and manganese-doped MAPbBr3 thin films. Using transient Faraday rotation spectroscopy, we probe the ultrafast magnetic moment dynamics following photoexcitation and find that light-induced magnetization in doped samples is increased by a factor of 10. We attribute this to photoexcited carriers acting on the magnetic moments of manganese dopant-ions via the sp-d exchange interaction, which forces them to align on picosecond timescales. Our findings open new avenues for device structures that use hybrid metal halide perovskites for ultrafast optical manipulation and read-out of magnetic order with the potential for high switching rates.</description>

Abstract: We studied discrete transmission lines constructed from ideal linear inductors and nonlinear capacitors (and possibly resistors). The localised travelling waves in the lossless transmission lines are the kinks and the solitons, which speeds and profiles were calculated. The localised travelling waves in the lossy transmission lines are the dissipative kinks and the shocks, which speeds and profiles were also calculated.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Short Pulse Looped Antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern optical systems send and receive ultra-short temporal pulses (USP). While ultra-broad band antennas do exist in the microwave region (e.g., log-periodic antennas, or, concentric loop antennas), their short temporal response is typically limited by the antenna's large dispersion, hence, resulting in a substantial pulse broadening. Here we show that loop antennas may exhibit USP attributes, below 400 ps (or, an equivalent coherent band pass exceeding 2.5 GHz) with only three loops, or, with a single, thick loop.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Fabrication of InGaP-on-Insulator for Nonlinear and Quantum Photonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of manufacturable and scalable integrated nonlinear photonic materials is driving key technologies in diverse areas such as high-speed communications, signal processing, sensing, and quantum information. Here, we demonstrate a novel nonlinear platform -- InGaP-on-insulator -- optimized for visible-to-telecommunication wavelength $\chi^{\left(2\right)}$ nonlinear optical processes. In this work, we detail our 100-mm wafer-scale InGaP-on-insulator fabrication process realized via wafer bonding, optical lithography, and dry-etching techniques. The resulting wafers yield 1000s of components in each fabrication cycle, with initial designs that include chip-to-fiber couplers, 12.5-cm-long nested spiral waveguides, and arrays of microring resonators with free-spectral ranges spanning 400-900 GHz. We demonstrate intrinsic resonator quality factors as high as 324,000 (440,000) for single-resonance (split-resonance) modes near 1550 nm corresponding to 1.56 dB cm$^{-1}$ (1.22 dB cm$^{-1}$) propagation loss. We analyze the loss versus waveguide width and resonator radius to establish the operating regime for optimal 775-to-1550 nm phase matching. By combining the high $\chi^{\left(2\right)}$ and $\chi^{\left(3\right)}$ optical nonlinearity of InGaP with wafer-scale fabrication and low propagation loss, these results open promising possibilities for entangled-photon, multi-photon, and squeezed light generation.</description>

      <title>1/f noise of a tiny tunnel magnetoresistance sensor originated from a wide distribution of bath correlation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) sensor is a highly sensitive magnetic field sensor and is expected to be applied in various fields, such as magnetic recording, industrial sensing, and bio-medical sensing. To improve the detection capability of TMR sensors in low frequency regime it is necessary to suppress the 1/f noise. We theoretically study 1/f noise of a tiny TMR sensor using the macrospin model. Starting from the generalized Langevin equation, 1/f noise power spectrum and the Hooge parameter are derived. The calculated Hooge parameter of a tiny TMR sensor is much smaller than that of a conventional TMR sensor with large junction area. The results provide a new perspective on magnetic 1/f noise and will be useful for improvement of TMR sensors.</description>

      <title>Lattice Energy Reservoir in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskite-based technologies have been rapidly developed during the last decade. However, to date, the fundamental question, why are halide perovskites superior to conventional semiconductors? has remained elusive. Here, we propose a new theory of lattice energy reservoir (LER) in halide perovskites and elucidate that LER can comprehensively impact charge carrier dynamics and thus enhance device performance, from hot carrier cooling, carrier recombination, anomalous upconversion fluorescence, illumination induced fluorescence enhancement (photobrightening), to high efficiency solar cells and light-emitting diodes. An LER is a dynamic nanodomain in halide perovskites with suppressed thermal transport that can accumulate energy from phonon coupling and then feedback to subgap carriers and result in subgap carrier upconversion. The LER directly results in slowed cooling of hot carriers and significantly prolonged carrier recombination, anomalous upconversion fluorescence, as usually termed as defect tolerance, as well as the anomalous ultraslow phenomena including persistent polarization, memory effect, and photobrightening. The LER theory rationalizes the superior optoelectronic properties and device performance and provides a novel physical understanding for anomalous phenomena observed uniquely in halide perovskites.</description>

Abstract: In our research, we have developed a novel mechanism that allows for a significant reduction in the smallest sampling unit of digital image sensors (DIS) to as small as 1/16th of a pixel, through measuring the intra-pixel quantum efficiency for the first time and recomputing the image. Employing our method, the physical sampling resolution of DIS can be enhanced by 16 times. The method has undergone rigorous testing in real-world imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued scatter compensation in nonlinear microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear, i.e., multi-photon microscopy is a powerful technique for imaging deep into biological tissues. Its penetration depth can be increased further using adaptive optics. In this work, we present a fast, feedback-based adaptive-optics algorithm, termed C-DASH, for multi-photon imaging through multiply-scattering media. C-DASH utilises complex-valued light shaping (i.e., joint shaping of amplitude and phase), which offers several advantages over phase-only techniques: it converges faster, it delivers higher image quality enhancement, it shows a robust performance largely insensitive to the axial position of the correction plane, and it has a higher ability to cope with, on the one hand, scattering media that vary over time and, on the other hand, scattering media that are partially absorbing. Furthermore, our method is practically self-aligning. We also present a simple way to implement C-DASH using a single reflection off a phase-only spatial light modulator. We provide a thorough characterisation of our method, presenting results of numerical simulations as well as two-photon excited fluorescence imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Stark Control of Plexcitonic States in Incoherent Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optic control of quantum dots embedded in the plasmonic nanocavities enables active tuning of photonic devices for emerging applications in Quantum optics such as quantum information processing, entanglement and ultrafast optical switching. Here, we demonstrate the coherent control of plexcitonic states in (i) an off-resonant and (ii) a resonant coupled quantum systems through optical Stark effect (OSE). We analyze a hybrid plasmon-emitter system which exhibits tunable Fano resonance, Stark induced transparency (SIT) and vacuum Rabi splitting due to quadratic Stark shift in the degenerate states of quantum emitter (QE). In addition, a resonantly coupled system shows the signature of double Fano resonance due to Stark-induced splitting in a two-level QE. Our study shows that Stark tuning of plexcitons not only mitigates decoherence in the quantum system but it also stimulates on/off switching of spontaneous photon emission in the visible regime. Such tunable systems can be used to operate photonic integrated circuits (PIC) for applications in quantum computing and information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting thin-film electronics are attractive for their low power consumption, fast operating speeds, and ease of interface with cryogenic systems such as single-photon detector arrays, and quantum computing devices. However, the lack of a reliable superconducting two-terminal asymmetric device, analogous to a semiconducting diode, limits the development of power-handling circuits, fundamental for scaling up these technologies. Existing efforts to date have been limited to single-diode proofs of principle and lacked integration of multiple controllable and reproducible devices to form complex circuits. Here, we demonstrate a robust superconducting diode with tunable polarity using the asymmetric Bean-Livingston surface barrier in niobium nitride micro-bridges, achieving a 43% rectification efficiency. We then realize and integrate several such diodes into a bridge rectifier circuit on a single microchip that performs continuous full-wave rectification up to 3 MHz and AC-to-DC conversion in burst mode at 50 MHz with an estimated peak power efficiency of 60%.</description>

      <title>Towards the superlubricity of polymer-steel interfaces with ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frictional losses are responsible for significant energy waste in many practical applications, and superlubricity with a coefficient of friction lower than 0.01 is the goal of tribologists. In this paper, metal-on-polymer contact was analysed and close to superlubricity conditions for this material configuration were explored. A new lubricant has been proposed hinge on the phosphorus-based ionic liquid and carbon nanotubes as thickeners. Additionally, carbon nanotube mesh was doped with copper nanoparticles that allowed for the close to superlubricity state in a mild steel/polymer contact configuration under low normal load conditions. The adsorption of phosphorus onto metallic and polymer surfaces has been reported in EDS analysis. The formulation of the new lubricant allowed for stable dispersion with a carbon nanotube content as low as 0.1% wt. The carbon nanotubes and Cu nanoparticles have been analysed using TEM and SEM imaging. A tribological test in a block-on-ring system has been carried out. The wear of material, topography, and surface free energy have been analysed along with SEM/EDS images to explore the underlying mechanisms of friction and wear.</description>
