      <title>A categorical approach to additive combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the definition of Freiman homomorphism we explore the possibilities of formulating some basic notions and techniques of additive combinatorics in a categorical language. We show that additive sets and Freiman homomorphisms form a category and we study several limit and colimit constructions in this, and in an interesting subcategory of this category. Moreover, we study the additive structure of these (co)limit objects using additive doubling constant. We relate this category to that of finite sets and mappings, and that of abelian groups and group homomorphisms. We show that the Konyagin \&amp; Lev result on universal ambient groups is an instance of adjunction.</description>

      <title>Extremal chemical graphs of maximum degree at most 3 for 33 degree-based topological indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider chemical graphs that are defined as connected graphs of maximum degree at most 3. We characterize the extremal graphs, meaning those that maximize or minimize 33 degree-based topological indices. This study shows that five graph families are sufficient to characterize the extremal graphs of 29 of these 33 indices. In other words, the extremal properties of this set of degree-based topological indices vary very little.</description>

      <title>Permutations minimizing the number of collinear triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the permutations of $\mathbb{F}_q$ whose graph minimizes the number of collinear triples and describe the lexicographically-least one, affirming a conjecture of Cooper-Solymosi. This question is closely connected to Dudeney's No-3-in-a-Line problem, the Heilbronn triangle problem, and the structure of finite plane Kakeya sets. We discuss a connection with complete sets of mutually orthogonal latin squares and state a few open problems primarily about general finite affine planes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix integers $d,r\ge 2$ and suppose that the edge set of the $d$-fold Cartesian product of the $N$-clique $K_N^d$ is $r$-colored. We show that there is a copy of $K_n^d$ whose edges in each direction are monochromatic provided $N &gt; 2^{2^{c n^{d-1}}}$, where $c$ depends only on $r$ and $d$. This improves the previous best exponent of $n^d$ proved by Gir\~ao, Kronenberg, and Scott while also improving the best known bound due to them for a multidimensional Erd\H os-Szekeres monotone subsequence theorem introduced by Fishburn and Graham.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every connected graph $G$ and surface $S$, we consider the well-known string of inequalities $\delta_S(G) \leq \mu_S(G) \leq \nu_S(G)$, where $\mu$ and $\nu$ denote skewness and crossing number and $\delta$ is the Euler-formula lower bound. Recent developments are surveyed; new results are given for the ``folded'' cube including its genus.</description>

      <title>Prime Multiple Missing Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture remains open for nearly three centuries. Recently Goldbach graphs are introduced to relate the problem with the literature of Graph Theory. It is shown that the connectedness of the graphs is equivalent to the affirmative answer of the conjecture. Some modified version of the graphs, say, near Goldbach graphs are shown to be Hamiltonian for small number of vertices. In this context, we introduce a class of graphs, namely, prime multiple missing graphs such that near Goldbach graphs are finite intersections of these graphs. We study these graphs for primes 3,5 and in general for any odd prime p. We prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 3 and Hamiltonian for even (&gt;2) vertices. Next the intersection of prime multiple missing graphs for primes 3 and 5 are studied. We prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 4 and they are also Hamiltonian for even (&gt;2) vertices. We observe that the diameters of finite Goldbach graphs and near Goldbach graphs are bounded by 5 (up to 10000 vertices). We believe further study on these graphs with big data analysis will help to understand structures of near Goldbach graphs.</description>

      <title>Coloring of ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graph with $\omega(G)\geq 3$, then $\chi(G)\leq \max\{6, \omega(G)\}$, and that the bound is tight for $\omega(G)\notin \{4,5\}$. These extend the results known for the class of ($P_2+P_3$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, improves the bound of Chen and Zhang [arXiv:2412.14524[math.CO], 2024] given for the class of ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, partially answers a question of Ju and Huang [Theor. Comp. Sci. 993 (2024) Article No.: 114465] on `near optimal colorable graphs', and partially answers a question of Schiermeyer (unpublished) on the chromatic bound for ($P_7$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Coalgebras, bialgebras and Rota-Baxter algebras from shuffles of rooted forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study new generalisations to rooted trees and forests of some properties of shuffles of words. First, we build a coproduct on rooted trees which, together with their shuffle, endow them with bialgebra structure. We then caracterize the coproduct dual to the shuffle product of rooted forests and build a product on rooted trees to obtain the bialgebra dual to the shuffle bialgebra. We then characterize and enumerate primitive trees for the dual coproduct. Finally, using modified shuffles of rooted forests, we prove a property in the category of Rota-Baxter algebras.</description>

      <title>On graphs with large third eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\lambda_3$ denote the third largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this paper, we prove various results towards the conjecture that $\lambda_3(G) \le \frac{|V(G)|}{3}$, motivated by a question of Nikiforov. We generalise the known constructions that yield $\lambda_3(G) = \frac{|V(G)|}{3} - 1$ and prove the inequality holds for $G$ strongly regular, a regular line graph or a Cayley graph on an abelian group. We also consider the extended problem of minimising $\lambda_{n-1}$ on weighted graphs and reduce the existence of a minimiser with simple final eigenvalue to a vertex multiplication of a graph on 11 vertices. We prove that the minimal $\lambda_{n-1}$ over weighted graphs is at most $O(\sqrt{n})$ from the minimal $\lambda_{n-1}$ over unweighted graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a family $\mathcal{F}$ of sets and a disjoint pair $A,B$ we let $\mathcal{F}(A,\overline{B})=\{F\in \mathcal{F}: A\subseteq F, ~B\cap F=\emptyset\}$. The \textbf{$(p,q)$-d\"omd\"od\"om} of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ is $\beta_{p,q}(\mathcal{F})=\min\{|\mathcal{F}(A,\overline{B})|:|A|=p,|B|=q, A\cap B=\emptyset, A,B\subseteq [n]\} $. This definition encompasses size, diversity, minimum degree, and sturdiness as special cases. We investigate the maximum possible value $\beta_{p,q}(n,k)$ of $\beta_{p,q}(\mathcal{F})$ over all $k$-uniform intersecting families $\mathcal{F}\subset 2^{[n]}$. We determine the order of magnitude of $\beta_{p,q}(n,k)$ for all fixed $p,q,k$. We relate the asymptotics of $\beta_{p,q}(n,k)$ to the constant value of $\beta_{0,q}(n,q+1)$ and establish $\beta_{p,1}(n,k)=\binom{n-3-p}{k-2-p}$ and $\beta_{p,2}(n,k)=2\binom{n-5}{k-3-p}-\binom{n-7}{k-5-p}$ if $n$ is large enough.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism in Union-Closed Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{K}_1$ and $\mathcal{K}_2$ be $\textit{pure union-closed families of sets}$. A map $h: \mathcal{K}_1 \to \mathcal{K}_2$ is an isomorphism if it is bijective and preserves unions: $h(A \cup B) = h(A) \cup h(B)$ for all $A, B \in \mathcal{K}_1$. We establish that for any isomorphism $h$, there exists a corresponding $\textit{hyperisomorphism}$ $H: \bigcup \mathcal{K}_1 \to \bigcup \mathcal{K}_2$ such that $h(A) = H(A)$ for all $A \in \mathcal{K}_1$.</description>

      <title>Connectivity and matching extendability of optimal $1$-embedded graphs on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss optimal $1$-toroidal graphs (abbreviated as O1TG), which are drawn on the torus so that every edge crosses another edge at most once, and has $n$ vertices and exactly $4n$ edges. We first consider connectivity of O1TGs, and give the characterization of O1TGs having connectivity exactly $k$ for each $k\in \{4, 5, 6, 8\}$. In our argument, we also show that there exists no O1TG having connectivity exactly $7$. Furthermore, using the result above, we discuss extendability of matchings, and give the characterization of $1$-, $2$- and $3$-extendable O1TGs in turn.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset $S\subseteq V$ is called {\it an isolating set} of $G$ if $V\setminus N_G[S]$ is an independent set of $G$, where $N_G[S]=S\cup N_G(S)$, and {\it the isolation number} of $G$, denoted by $\iota(G)$, is the size of a smallest isolating set of $G$. In this article, we show that the isolation number of the middle graph of $G$ is equal to the size of a smallest maximal matching of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work leverages Shearer's inequalities to derive a new upper bound on the maximum cardinality of a family of graphs on a fixed number of vertices, in which every pair of graphs shares a fixed common subgraph. The derived bound is expressed in terms of the chromatic number of the shared subgraph. Additionally, Shearer's inequalities, in conjunction with properties of the Shannon entropy, are employed to establish bounds related to the enumeration of graph homomorphisms, providing further insights into the interplay between combinatorial structures and information-theoretic principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q=p^\alpha$ be a fixed prime power, $k\geq 2$ be an integer. We give a new upper bound for the size of $k$-wise $q$-modular $L$-avoiding $L$-intersecting set systems, where $L$ is any proper subset of $\{0, \ldots , q-1\}$.
  Our proof is based on the linear algebra bound method and basic number theory.</description>

      <title>$2$-Restricted Optimal Pebbling Number of Some Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph. A pebbling configuration on $G$ is a function $f:V\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\cup \{0\}$ that assigns a non-negative integer number of pebbles to each vertex. The weight of a configuration $f$ is $w(f)=\sum_{u\in V}f(u)$, the total number of pebbles. A pebbling move consists of removing two pebbles from a vertex $u$ and placing one pebble on an adjacent vertex $v$. A configuration $f$ is a $t$-restricted pebbling configuration ($t$RPC) if no vertex has more than $t$ pebbles. The $t$-restricted optimal pebbling number $\pi_t^*(G)$ is the minimum weight of a $t$RPC on $G$ that allows any vertex to be reached by a sequence of pebbling moves. The distinguishing number $D(G)$ is the minimum number of colors needed to label the vertices of $G$ such that the only automorphism preserving the coloring is the trivial one (i.e., the identity map). In this paper, we investigate the $2$-restricted optimal pebbling number of trees $T$ with $D(T)=2$ and radius at most $2$ and enumerate their $2$-restricted optimal pebbling configurations. Also we study the $2$-restricted optimal pebbling number of some graphs that are of importance in chemistry such as some alkanes.</description>

      <title>The Lehmer complex of a Bruhat interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Lehmer codes, with immersions in the Bruhat order, for several finite Coxeter groups, including all the classical Weyl groups. This allows to associate to each lower Bruhat interval of these groups a multicomplex whose f-polynomial is the Poincar\'e polynomial of the interval. Via a general construction, we prove that these polynomials are h-polynomials of vertex-decomposable simplicial complexes. Moreover we provide a classification, in terms of unimodal permutations, of Poincar\'e polynomials of smooth Schubert varieties in flag manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a search algorithm for systems of $q$-difference equations satisfied by Andrews-Gordon type double series. We then couple the search algorithm with Euler's algorithm for finding infinite products to narrow the search space. We exemplify some findings of the algorithm, along with their proofs. We also explain some of the double series in a base partition and moves framework.</description>

      <title>Helly-type theorems for separated d-intervals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A separated $d$-interval is defined as a disjoint union of $d$ convex sets from the real line $\mathbb R$. In this paper, we establish a series of Helly-type theorems for convexity spaces derived from separated $d$-intervals. Our results encompass the Radon number, Helly number, colorful Helly number, fractional Helly number, colorful fractional Helly theorem, $(p,q)$ theorem, and two kinds of colorful $(p,q)$ theorems for these convexity spaces. The primary tools employed in our proofs involve simplicial complexes and collapsibility.</description>

      <title>A note on improved bounds for hypergraph rainbow matching problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural question, inspired by the famous Ryser-Brualdi-Stein Conjecture, is to determine the largest positive integer $g(r,n)$ such that every collection of $n$ matchings, each of size $n$, in an $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph contains a rainbow matching of size $g(r,n)$. The parameter $g'(r,n)$ is defined identically with the exception that the host hypergraph is not required to be $r$-partite.
  In this note, we improve the best known lower bounds on $g'(r,n)$ for all $r \geq 4$ and the upper bounds on $g(r,n)$ for all $r \geq 3$, provided $n$ is sufficiently large. More precisely, we show that if $r\ge3$ then $$\frac{2n}{r+1}-\Theta_r(1)\le g'(r,n)\le g(r,n)\le n-\Theta_r(n^{1-\frac{1}{r}}).$$ Interestingly, while it has been conjectured that $g(2,n)=g'(2,n)=n-1$, our results show that if $r\ge3$ then $g(r,n)$ and $g'(r,n)$ are bounded away from $n$ by a function which grows in $n$.
  We also prove analogous bounds for the related problem where we are interested in the smallest size $s$ for which any collection of $n$ matchings of size $s$ in an ($r$-partite) $r$-uniform hypergraph contains a rainbow matching of size $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends and generalizes previous works on constructing combinatorial multivector fields from continuous systems (see [10]) and the construction of combinatorial vector fields from data (see [2]) by introducing an optimization based framework for the construction of combinatorial multivector fields from finite vector field data. We address key challenges in convexity, computational complexity and resolution, providing theoretical guarantees and practical methodologies for generating combinatorial representation of the dynamics of our data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a non-associative analog to the well-known $\frac{5}{8}$ Theorem. Namely, for a finite Moufang loop with nuclear commutators, we show that if the probability that three randomly chosen elements associate is greater than $\frac{43}{64}$, then the loop must be a group. The bound is tight as demonstrated by the 16-element Octonion loop.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bounds for Open Addressing Without Reordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit one of the simplest problems in data structures: the task of inserting elements into an open-addressed hash table so that elements can later be retrieved with as few probes as possible. We show that, even without reordering elements over time, it is possible to construct a hash table that achieves far better expected search complexities (both amortized and worst-case) than were previously thought possible. Along the way, we disprove the central conjecture left by Yao in his seminal paper ``Uniform Hashing is Optimal''. All of our results come with matching lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Efficient $d$-ary Cuckoo Hashing at High Load Factors by Bubbling Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $d$-ary cuckoo hash table is an open-addressed hash table that stores each key $x$ in one of $d$ random positions $h_1(x), h_2(x), \ldots, h_d(x)$. In the offline setting, where all items are given and keys need only be matched to locations, it is possible to support a load factor of $1 - \epsilon$ while using $d = \lceil \ln \epsilon^{-1} + o(1) \rceil$ hashes. The online setting, where keys are moved as new keys arrive sequentially, has the additional challenge of the time to insert new keys, and it has not been known whether one can use $d = O(\ln \epsilon^{-1})$ hashes to support $\poly(\epsilon^{-1})$ expected-time insertions.
  In this paper, we introduce bubble-up cuckoo hashing, an implementation of $d$-ary cuckoo hashing that achieves all of the following properties simultaneously:
  (1) uses $d = \lceil \ln \epsilon^{-1} + \alpha \rceil$ hash locations per item for an arbitrarily small positive constant $\alpha$.
  (2) achieves expected insertion time $O(\delta^{-1})$ for any insertion taking place at load factor $1 - \delta \le 1 - \epsilon$.
  (3) achieves expected positive query time $O(1)$, independent of $d$ and $\epsilon$.
  The first two properties give an essentially optimal value of $d$ without compromising insertion time. The third property is interesting even in the offline setting: it says that, even though \emph{negative} queries must take time $d$, positive queries can actually be implemented in $O(1)$ expected time, even when $d$ is large.</description>

      <title>On the jump of the cover time in random geometric graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the cover time of the simple random walk of the giant component of supercritical $d$-dimensional random geometric graphs on $n$ vertices. We show that the cover time undergoes a jump at the connectivity threshold radius $r_c$: with $r_g$ denoting the threshold for having a giant component, we show that if the radius $r$ satisfies $r_c &lt; r \le (1-\varepsilon)r_g$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the cover time of the giant component is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log^2 n$). On the other hand, we show that for $r \ge (1+\varepsilon)r_c$, the cover time of the graph is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log n)$ (which was known for $d=2$ only for a radius larger by a constant factor).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a specific class of $q$-polynomial sequences that serve as a $q$-analogue of the classical Appell sequences. This framework offers an elegant approach to revisiting classical results by Carlitz and, more interestingly, to establishing an important extension of the Carlitz $q$-Bernoulli polynomials and numbers. In addition, we establish explicit series representations for our extended Carlitz $q$-Bernoulli numbers and express them in terms of $q$-Stirling numbers of the second kind. This leads to a novel formula that explicitly connects the Carlitz $q$-Bernoulli numbers with the $q$-Stirling numbers of the second kind.</description>

Abstract: We establish a strong link between two open problems: determining the Reidemeister spectrum of free nilpotent groups and determining the coefficients in the Schur expansion of plethysms of Schur functions. Specifically, we show that the expressions occurring in the computations for the Reidemeister spectrum are sums of plethysms of the form $s_{1^{i}}[g]$, where $g$ is a Schur function or a Schur positive function.</description>

Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the parking process on the random recursive tree. We first prove that although the random recursive tree has a non-degenerate Benjamini--Schramm limit, the phase transition for the parking process appears at density $0$. We then identify the critical window for appearance of a positive flux of cars with high probability. In the case of binary car arrivals, this happens at density $ \log (n)^{-2+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the size of the tree. This is the first work that studies the parking process on trees with possibly large degree vertices.</description>

Abstract: A supersequence over a finite set is a sequence that contains as subsequence all permutations of the set. This paper defines an infinite array of methods to create supersequences of decreasing lengths. This yields the shortest known supersequences over larger sets. It also provides the best results asymptotically. It is based on a general proof using a new property called strong completeness. The same technique also can be used to prove existing supersequences which combines the old and new ones into an unified conceptual framework.</description>

      <title>A New Formula for the Determinant and Bounds on Its Tensor and Waring Ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new explicit formula for the determinant that contains superexponentially fewer terms than the usual Leibniz formula. As an immediate corollary of our formula, we show that the tensor rank of the $n \times n$ determinant tensor is no larger than the $n$-th Bell number, which is much smaller than the previously best known upper bounds when $n \geq 4$. Over fields of non-zero characteristic we obtain even tighter upper bounds, and we also slightly improve the known lower bounds. In particular, we show that the $4 \times 4$ determinant over $\mathbb{F}_2$ has tensor rank exactly equal to $12$. Our results also improve upon the best known upper bound for the Waring rank of the determinant when $n \geq 17$, and lead to a new family of axis-aligned polytopes that tile $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Fast Evaluation of Generalized Todd Polynomials: Applications to MacMahon's Partition Analysis and Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Todd polynomials, denoted as $td_k(b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m)$, are characterised by their generating functions: $$\sum_{k\ge 0} td_k s^k = \prod_{i=1}^m \frac{b_i s}{e^{b_i s}-1}.$$ These polynomials serve as fundamental components in the Todd class of toric varieties, a concept of significant relevance in the study of lattice polytopes and number theory. We identify that generalised Todd polynomials emerge naturally within the framework of MacMahon's partition analysis, particularly in the context of computing Ehrhart series. We introduce an efficient method for the evaluation of generalised Todd polynomials for numerical values of $b_i$. This is achieved through the development of expedited operations in the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}_p[[s]]$ modulo $s^{d}$, where $p$ is a large prime. The practical implications of our work are demonstrated through two applications: firstly, we facilitate a recalculated resolution of the Ehrhart series for magic squares of order 6, a problem initially addressed by the first author, reducing computation time from 70 days to approximately 1 day; secondly, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for Integer Linear Programming when the dimension is fixed, exhibiting a notable enhancement in computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real, complex, and tropical algebraic geometry join forces in a new branch of mathematical physics called positive geometry. We develop the positive geometry of del Pezzo surfaces and their moduli spaces, viewed as very affine varieties. Their connected components are derived from polyhedral spaces with Weyl group symmetries. We study their canonical forms and scattering amplitudes, and we solve the likelihood equations.</description>

      <title>Computing Subset Vertex Covers in $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a natural generalization of Vertex Cover: the Subset Vertex Cover problem, which is to decide for a graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset $T\subseteq V$ and integer $k$, if $V$ has a subset $S$ of size at most $k$, such that $S$ contains at least one end-vertex of every edge incident to a vertex of $T$. A graph is $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. We solve two open problems from the literature by proving that Subset Vertex Cover is NP-complete on subcubic (claw,diamond)-free planar graphs and on $2$-unipolar graphs, a subclass of $2P_3$-free weakly chordal graphs. Our results show for the first time that Subset Vertex Cover is computationally harder than Vertex Cover (under P $\neq$ NP). We also prove new polynomial time results, some of which follow from a reduction to Vertex Cover restricted to classes of probe graphs. We first give a dichotomy on graphs where $G[T]$ is $H$-free. Namely, we show that Subset Vertex Cover is polynomial-time solvable on graphs $G$, for which $G[T]$ is $H$-free, if $H=sP_1+tP_2$ and NP-complete otherwise. Moreover, we prove that Subset Vertex Cover is polynomial-time solvable for $(sP_1+P_2+P_3)$-free graphs and bounded mim-width graphs. By combining our new results with known results we obtain a partial complexity classification for Subset Vertex Cover on $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral combinatorics of bisectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any polyhedral norm, the bisector of two points is a polyhedral complex. We study combinatorial aspects of this complex. We investigate the sensitivity of the presence of labelled maximal cells in the bisector relative to the position of the two points. We thereby extend work of Criado, Joswig and Santos (2022) who showed that for the tropical distance function the presence of maximal cells is encoded by a polyhedral fan, the bisection fan. We initiate the study of bisection cones and bisection fans with respect to arbitrary polyhedral norms. In particular, we show that the bisection fan always exists for polyhedral norms in two dimensions. Furthermore, we determine the bisection fan of the $\ell_{1}$-norm and the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm as well as the discrete Wasserstein distance in arbitrary dimensions. Intricate combinatorial structures, such as the resonance arrangement, make their appearance. We apply our results to obtain bounds on the combinatorial complexity of the bisectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper initiates the explicit study of face numbers of matroid polytopes and their computation. We prove that, for the large class of split matroid polytopes, their face numbers depend solely on the number of cyclic flats of each rank and size, together with information on the modular pairs of cyclic flats. We provide a formula which allows us to calculate $f$-vectors without the need of taking convex hulls or computing face lattices. We discuss the particular cases of sparse paving matroids and rank two matroids, which are of independent interest due to their appearances in other combinatorial and geometric settings.</description>

Abstract: Topological indices are important bridge between graph theory and chemical applications. The study of graph matching expandability has been an influential topic in recent research on graph structure. In this paper, we provide some sufficient conditions for a graph to be $k$-extendable graphs, $n$-factor-critical graphs and $(n,k,d)$-graphs and graphs with prefect matching in terms of a significant type of Topological index: the Zeroth-order General Randi\'c Index ($\alpha\ge-1$ and $\alpha\neq 0$).</description>

Abstract: We study several basic problems about colouring the $p$-random subgraph $G_p$ of an arbitrary graph $G$, focusing primarily on the chromatic number and colouring number of $G_p$. In particular, we show that there exist infinitely many $k$-regular graphs $G$ for which the colouring number (i.e., degeneracy) of $G_{1/2}$ is at most $k/3 + o(k)$ with high probability, thus disproving the natural prediction that such random graphs must have colouring number at least $k/2 - o(k)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the avoidance of patterns in inversion sequences that relate sorting via sorting machines including data structures such as pop stacks and stacks. Such machines have been studied under a variety of additional constraints and generalizations, some of which we apply here. We give the classification of several classes of sortable inversion sequences in terms of pattern avoidance. We are able to provide an exact enumeration of some of the sortable classes in question using both classical approaches and a more recent strategy utilizing generating trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of a graph $G$ is the difference between the largest and smallest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $G$. In this paper, we consider the family of graphs which contain no $K_{s,t}$-minor. We show that for any $t\geq s \geq 2$ and sufficiently large $n$, there is an integer $\xi_{t}$ such that the extremal $n$-vertex $K_{s,t}$-minor-free graph attaining the maximum spread is the graph obtained by joining a graph $L$ on $(s-1)$ vertices to the disjoint union of $\lfloor \frac{2n+\xi_{t}}{3t}\rfloor$ copies of $K_t$ and $n-s+1 - t\lfloor \frac{2n+\xi_t}{3t}\rfloor$ isolated vertices. Furthermore, we give an explicit formula for $\xi_{t}$ and an explicit description for the graph $L$ for $t \geq \frac32(s-3) +\frac{4}{s-1}$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$. The leaf distance of a tree is defined as the minimum distance between any two leaves. Motivated by the conjecture proposed by Kaneko, Kano and Suzuki (2007) and its subsequent confirmation by Erbes, Molla, Mousley and Santana (2017), we obtain the lower bound in terms of the size and the adjacent spectral radius to guarantee that $G$ contains a spanning tree with leaf distance at least $d$, where $4\leq d \leq n-1$.</description>

Abstract: We study the slices or sections of a convex polytope by affine hyperplanes. We present results on two key problems: First, we provide tight bounds on the maximum number of vertices attainable by a hyperplane slice of $d$-polytope (a sort of upper bound theorem) and discuss a new algorithm to find all sections. Second, we investigate the sequence of numbers of vertices produced by the different slices over all possible hyperplanes and analyze the gaps that arise in that sequence. We study these sequences for three-dimensional polytopes and for hypercubes. Our results were obtained with the help of large computational experiments, and we report on new data generated for hypercubes.</description>

Abstract: Let $hA$ denote the $h$-fold sumset of a subset $A$ of an abelian group. Resolving a problem of Nathanson, we show that for any prescribed permutations $\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_H \in \mathfrak{S}_n$, there exist finite subsets $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ such that for each $1 \leq h \leq H$, the relative order of the quantities $|h A_1|, \ldots, |h A_n|$ is given by $\sigma_h$. We also establish extensions where $\mathbb{Z}$ is replaced by any other infinite abelian group or where one prescribes some equalities (not only inequalities) among the sumset sizes.</description>

      <title>Bound on shortest cycle covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume $G$ is a bridgeless graph. A cycle cover of $G$ is a collection of cycles of $G$ such that each edge of $G$ is contained in at least one of the cycles. The length of a cycle cover of $G$ is the sum of the lengths of the cycles in the cover. The minimum length of a cycle cover of $G$ is denoted by $cc(G)$. It was proved independently by Alon and Tarsi and by Bermond, Jackson, and Jaeger that $cc(G)\le \frac{5}{3}m$ for every bridgeless graph $G$ with $m$ edges. This remained the best-known upper bound for $cc(G)$ for 40 years. In this paper, we prove that if $G$ is a bridgeless graph with $m$ edges and $n_2$ vertices of degree $2$, then $cc(G) &lt; \frac{29}{18}m+ \frac 1{18}n_2$. As a consequence, we show that $cc(G) \le \frac 53 m - \frac 1{42} \log m$. The upper bound $ cc(G) &lt; \frac{29}{18}m \approx 1.6111 m$ for bridgeless graphs $G$ of minimum degree at least 3 improves the previous known upper bound $1.6258m$. A key lemma used in the proof confirms Fan's conjecture that if $C$ is a circuit of $G$ and $G/C$ admits a nowhere zero 4-flow, then $G$ admits a 4-flow $f$ such that $E(G)-E(C)\subseteq \text{supp} (f)$ and $|\textrm{supp}(f)\cap E(C)|&gt;\frac{3}{4}|E(C)|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $d \geq 0$ be an integer and $P \subset \mathbb R^d$ be a $d$-dimensional lattice polytope. We call a polytope $M \subset \mathbb R^d$ such that $M \subset P$ and $M \sim P$ a miniature of $P,$ and it is said to be horizontal if $M$ is transformed into $P$ by translating and rescaling. A miniature $M$ of $P$ is said to be average-sized (resp. normal-sized) if the volume of $M$ is equal to the limit of the sequence whose $n$-th term is the average of the volumes of all miniarures (resp. all horizontal miniatures) whose vertices belong to $(\mathbb Z[1/n])^d.$ We prove that, for any lattice square $P \subset \mathbb R^2,$ the ratio of the areas of an average-sized miniature of $P$ and $P$ is $2:15.$ We also prove that, for any lattice simplex $P \subset \mathbb R^d,$ the ratio of the volumes of a normal-sized miniature of $P$ and $P$ is $1:\binom{2d+1}{d}.$ This ratio is the same as the known result for the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ provided by the author.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Approach to Finding Degree-Doubling Nodes in Oriented Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seymour's Second Neighborhood Conjecture asserts that in the square of any oriented graph, there exists a node whose out-degree at least doubles. This paper presents a definitive proof of the conjecture by introducing the GLOVER (Graph Level Order) data structure, which facilitates a systematic partitioning of neighborhoods and an analysis of degree-doubling conditions. By leveraging this structure, we construct a decreasing sequence of subsets that establish a well-ordering of nodes, ensuring that no counterexample can exist. This approach not only confirms the conjecture for all oriented graphs but also provides a novel framework for analyzing degrees and arcs in complex networks. The findings have implications for theoretical graph studies and practical applications in network optimization and algorithm design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1607.07748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sunada's work on crystallography emphasizes the role of the "maximal abelian cover" of a graph $X$. This is a covering space of $X$ for which the group of deck transformations is the first homology group $H_1(X,\mathbb{Z})$. An embedding of the maximal abelian cover in a vector space can serve as the pattern for a crystal: atoms are located at the vertices, while bonds lie along the edges. We prove that for any connected graph $X$ without bridges, there is a canonical embedding of the maximal abelian cover of $X$ into the vector space $H_1(X,\mathbb{R})$, called a "topological crystal". Crystals of graphene and diamond are examples of this construction. We prove that any symmetry of a graph lifts to a symmetry of its topological crystal. We also compute the density of atoms in a topological crystal. The key technical tools are a way of decomposing the 1-chain coming from a path in $X$ into manageable pieces, and the work of Bacher, de la Harpe and Nagnibeda on integral cycles and integral cuts.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap of nonreversible Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the spectral gap of a Markov chain on a finite state space as the second-smallest singular value of the generator of the chain, generalizing the usual definition of spectral gap for reversible chains. We then define the relaxation time of the chain as the inverse of this spectral gap, and show that this relaxation time can be characterized, for any Markov chain, as the time required for convergence of empirical averages. This relaxation time is related to the Cheeger constant and the mixing time of the chain through inequalities that are similar to the reversible case, and the path argument can be used to get upper bounds. Several examples are worked out. An interesting finding from the examples is that the time for convergence of empirical averages in nonreversible chains can often be substantially smaller than the mixing time.</description>

      <title>The 2D Toda lattice hierarchy for multiplicative statistics of Schur measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Fredholm determinants build out from generalizations of Schur measures, or equivalently, arbitrary multiplicative statistics of the original Schur measures are tau-functions of the 2D Toda lattice hierarchy. Our result apply to finite temperature Schur measures, and extends both the result of Okounkov in \cite{okounkovschurmeasures} and of Cafasso-Ruzza in \cite{cafassoruzza} concerning the finite-temperature Plancherel measure. Our proof lies on the semi-infinite wedge formalism and the Boson-Fermion correspondance.</description>

      <title>On the central ball in a translation invariant involutive field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The iterated composition of two operators, both of which are involutions and translation invariant, partitions the set of lattice points in the plane into an infinite sequence of discrete parabolas. Each such parabola contains an associated stairway-like path connecting certain points on it, induced by the alternating application of the aforementioned operators. Any two lattice points in the plane can be connected by paths along the square grid composed of steps either on these stairways or towards taxicab neighbors. This leads to the notion of the parabolic-taxicab distance between two lattice points, obtained as the minimum number of steps of this kind needed to reach one point from the other.
  In this paper, we describe patterns generated by points on paths of bounded parabolic-taxicab length and provide a complete description of the balls centered at the origin. In particular, we prove an earlier conjecture on the area of these balls.</description>

      <title>On the action of the symmetric group on the free LAnKe II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A LAnKe (also known as a Lie algebra of the $n$th kind, or a Filippov algebra) is a vector space equipped with a skew-symmetric $n$-linear form that satisfies the generalized Jacobi identity. The symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_m$ acts on the multilinear part of the free LAnKe on $m=(n-1)k+1$ generators, where $k$ is the number of brackets. The corresponding representation was studied by Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs, who asked whether for $n \ge k$, its irreducible decomposition contains no summand whose Young diagram has at most $k-1$ columns. It is known that the answer is affirmative if $k \le 3$. In this paper, we show that the answer is affirmative for all $k$.</description>

      <title>Families of lattices with an unbounded number of unit vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3 families of 4-dimensional lattices $L_k, M_k, M_k / 2 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ are defined. Each lattice is defined by 2 quadratic extensions and has a \emph{finite} number of unit vectors, but the number of unit vectors in each of the 3 familes is \emph{unbounded}. $L_3$ is the Moser lattice.</description>

      <title>Graphs of trigonal curves and rigid isotopies of singular real algebraic curves of bidegree $(4,3)$ on a hyperboloid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rigid isotopy of real algebraic curves of a certain class is a path in the space of curves of this class. The paper's study completes the rigid isotopic classification of nonsingular real algebraic curves of bidegree (4,3) on a hyperboloid, begun by the author in earlier works. There are given the missing proofs of the uniqueness of the connected components for 16 classes of real algebraic curves of bidegree (4,3) having a single node or a cusp. The main technical tools are graphs of real trigonal curves on Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a determinstic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave determinstic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, with partially identical shapes and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>
