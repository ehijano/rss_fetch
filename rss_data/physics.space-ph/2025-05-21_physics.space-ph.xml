      <title>The evolution of CME sheath turbulence from L1 to Earth: Wind and MMS observations of the 2023-04-23 CME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interplanetary shock driven by a coronal mass ejection (CME) containing an interval of sub-Alfv\'enic flow impacted Earth on April 23, 2024. In this article, we analyze the turbulence in the sheath region between the shock and CME to determine how it evolves from L1 (as observed by Wind) to Earth (as observed by MMS, upstream of the bow shock). Wind and MMS were separated by $55\,\mathrm{R_{E}}$ in the dawn-dusk direction, but the shock normals differ by only $2.8^{\circ}$ and the Pearson correlation coefficient between time-shifted magnetic field components is $\rho=0.93$. We observe a shift in the break point of the magnetic power spectral density between inertial and ion kinetic scales toward the ion inertial length and a steepening of the spectral slope, indicating more active energy cascade closer to Earth. The distribution of increments becomes more non-Gaussian near Earth, particularly at ion kinetic scales, indicating the turbulence becomes more intermittent. Finally, the correlation length at Earth is 25\% longer than at L1, indicating that the turbulence is smoothing out the magnetic field. The results present an example of substantial evolution of CME sheath turbulence from L1 to Earth.</description>

      <title>Tracking Reentries of Starlink Satellites During the Rising Phase of Solar Cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential increase of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites in the past 5 years has brought into intense focus the need for reliable monitoring and reentry prediction to safeguard from space collisions and ground debris impacts. However, LEO satellites fly within the upper atmosphere region that exerts significant drag forces to their orbits, reducing their lifetimes, and increasing collision risks during dynamic events, like geomagnetic storms. Such conditions can become more severe during geomagnetic storms, particularly during extreme events. In this work, we use two-line element (TLE) satellite tracking data to investigate geomagnetic activity effects on the reentries of 523 Starlink satellites from 2020 to 2024. This period coincides with the rising phase of solar cycle 25, which has shown itself to be more intense than the previous solar cycle. We derive satellite altitudes and velocities from TLE files and perform a superposed epoch analysis, the first with hundreds of similar satellites. Even with limitedly accurate TLE data, our results indisputably show that satellites reenter faster with higher geomagnetic activity. This is explained by the fastest orbital decay rates (in km/day) of the satellites caused by increased drag forces. We also find that prediction errors, defined as the difference between the epochs of actual reentries and predicted reentries at reference altitudes, increase with geomagnetic activity. As a result, we clearly show that the intense solar activity of the current solar cycle has already had significant impacts on Starlink reentries. This is a very exciting time in satellite orbital drag research, since the number of satellites in LEO and solar activity are the highest ever observed in human history.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Martian UV Dayglow Emissions in the Southern Hemisphere during Solar Quiet-time Conditions: Insights from Multi-year MAVEN/IUVS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The southern hemisphere of Mars possesses concentrated region of strong crustal magnetic fields (CMF), which generate localized magnetic anomalies that can influence atmospheric dynamics and energy deposition in the Martian thermospheric-ionospheric system. Although their effects on the atmosphere (&gt;200 km) in the southern hemisphere are well documented, however their role in modulating the behavior of atmospheric plasma and neutrals below 200 km are poorly understood. The atmosphere at these altitudes can be comprehended by studying the variation of dayglow emissions. We have investigated few dayglow emissions over the CMF and non-CMF regions using the MAVEN remote-sensing measurements from Martian Years 33-37. Particularly, the CO Cameron bands, CO2+ ultraviolet doublet, and atomic oxygen emissions at 297.2 nm, 130.4 nm, and 135.6 nm have been studied below 200 km during solar quiet-time conditions. The results show strong seasonal variations in all the emissions peak altitudes and intensities in the dayside and near-terminator regions. The variation in the peak altitude of molecular and atomic emissions are nearly 20 km and 30 km, respectively. On the dayside, the emissions show minimal variation across CMF and non-CMF regions, indicating a minimal effect of the CMF at these altitudes, suggesting a key role of plasma demagnetization and photochemical processes. In addition, an insignificant variation in the dayglow emissions is likely masked by compensating mechanisms such as energy-dependent electron shielding and thermospheric expansion. This work presents the first focused investigation on the dayglow emissions over CMF and non-CMF regions across different seasons and solar zenith angles.</description>

      <title>Intermingled open and closed magnetic field lines near the radial origin of the heliospheric current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. To investigate the magnetic field geometry and waves in the region near the Sun where the heliospheric current sheet is formed. Methods. One good example of apparent open and closed field lines was found and its fields and plasmas were analyzed. Results. The radial component of the magnetic field (the Z-component) measured on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) changed sign between 12:00 and 13:00 UT on March 30, 2024, when the spacecraft was at 13 solar radii. This sign change may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed the heliospheric current sheet on long open magnetic field lines or it may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed from one side of the equator to the other on much shorter closed magnetic field lines. During this crossing, two distinct regions having different magnetic field geometries, strahl flows, plasma densities, and electric field spectra were observed and identified as regions with open and closed magnetic field lines, respectively. The two regions intermingled on time scales less than 100 milliseconds to create a complex magnetic field geometry. The waves observed in both regions were electrostatic and composed of wide band signatures (in the open field lines regions) and well-structured frequency harmonics (in both the open and closed field lines regions). These harmonic frequencies correlated with the proton plasma frequency, fpp, with the lowest frequency at ~0.1fpp. This result plus the field aligned electric field perturbations and plasma density fluctuations, require that the observed intense electrostatic mode and associated harmonics were ion acoustic waves. The absence of broadband electrostatic signals in closed field line regions is explained by the lower (than in open field line regions) hot and core electron density and higher ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency, suppressing wave generation.</description>
