      <title>Placental contractions in uncomplicated pregnancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first described the utero-placental pump phenomenon, in utero, in 2020. We have recruited 36 healthy pregnant women to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between 29 and 42 weeks of pregnancy to further explore this occurrence in a single centre prospective observational study. Participants had fetal ultrasound to confirm normal growth. Dynamic MRI was acquired for between 15 and 32 minutes using respiratory triggered, multi-slice, single shot, gradient echo, echo planar imaging covering the whole uterus. All participants had a live birth of a healthy baby weighing over the 10th centile for gestational age and no conditions associated with placental dysfunction e.g. pre-eclampsia. There were no cases of severe maternal or fetal villous malperfusion on placental histopathology. Visible contractions were recorded for all participants who completed MRI scans. Contractions involving a decrease in placental volume &gt;10% were classified as either placental or uterine by visual observation. Placental contractions occurred more frequently than uterine contractions (p=0.0061), were associated with a larger increase in the surface area of the uterine wall not covered by the placenta (p=0.0015), sphericity of the placenta(p&lt;0.0001) and longer durations (p=0.0151). Contractions led to an increase in the MRI parameter R2* in the placenta. There was large variation both between participants and between contractions from the same individual, in terms of the time course and features of contractions. Rate, duration and other features of contractions did not apparently change across the gestational age range studied, although the largest fractional volume changes were detected at early gestation. We found that placental contractions occurred in at least 60% of our healthy pregnant population with a median frequency of 2 per hour and median duration of 2.4 minutes.</description>

      <title>Manganese-based macrocyclic chelates as novel MRI contrast agents: In vivo imaging in a porcine model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: Mn-based MRI contrast agents (MBCAs) have recently been proposed as alternatives to the currently used class of Gd-chelates. Unlike Gd, Mn is an endogenous paramagnetic metal with known biochemical pathways in the human body for excretion and metal regulation, which may alleviate the raised concerns about the safety of existing GBCAs. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, kinetics and image enhancement properties of a class of novel Mn-based macrocyclic chelates in a porcine model. Methods: Macrocyclic MBCAs, AH114608, GEH300017 and GEH200486, were tested and compared to gadoterate meglumine. Twelve female adult pigs were divided into four groups (n=3 for each CA). At 3 T MRI, T1 relaxometry analysis were measured longitudinally in multiple organs at five timepoints 30 minutes apart. CA kinetics was estimated from analysis of plasma CA concentrations by ICP-OES. Results: All four CAs exhibited T1-enhancing properties in the blood pool with GEH200486 having the largest increase in T1 relaxation rate (R1), GEH300017 and gadoterate meglumine having similar R1 increase and AH114608 a lower peak R1 change. A persistent increase in liver, kidney and myocardium R1 was observed with AH114608. To a lesser extent, a persistent increase of liver enhancement was also observed in T1-weighted images for GEH300017 and GEH200486 compared to gadoterate meglumine. All four CAs had similar bi-exponential plasma kinetics characterized by a rapid distribution phase and a slower elimination phase. Discussion: We have identified MBCA candidates with predominantly renal clearance and comparable efficacy in terms of vascular T1 relaxation, and comparable to the reference GBCA. The T1-enhancing properties of these novel Mn macrocyclic CAs can be used with routine clinical protocols and could be potentially utilised as an alternative to GBCAs for contrast-enhanced MRI procedures.</description>

      <title>Wide Area Surface Dosimetry with Conformal Scintillator Array for External Beam Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: In vivo dosimetry is essential for treatment verification in modern radiotherapy, but existing techniques are limited by spatiotemporal resolution and performance on non-uniform anatomy. Scintillation imaging dosimetry shows potential to address several of these limitations. Here, translation to conventional photon external beam radiotherapy was examined using a novel wide-area imaging and sensing technique.
  Methods: A modular scintillator array was combined with a dual-camera stereovision system for 3D localization and a clinical Cherenkov imaging system for optical scintillation detection. Water equivalent thickness, dose linearity, repetition rate stability, and angular dependence were characterized. Field edge detection was evaluated against radiochromic film using gamma analysis. System reproducibility was tested with consecutive deliveries simulating contralateral breast monitoring during whole-breast tangential radiotherapy.
  Results: The array showed high dose linearity across the tested range, minimal beam perturbation, and consistent response within 5% across all available LINAC repetition rates. Dose-normalized scintillation varied within 5% over clinically relevant gantry angles, and camera angle corrections compensated for non-Lambertian emission. Field edge detection agreed closely with film, with a 99.98% gamma pass rate (3%/3 mm). Inter-delivery reproducibility of +/-1 cGy demonstrated robust system performance.
  Conclusion: The conformable scintillator array imaging system provides spatially resolved, dynamic surface dosimetry with minimal workflow impact. Its ability to generate continuous dose maps across complex anatomical surfaces, while maintaining angular correction, addresses key limitations of current in vivo dosimetry and shows strong potential for clinical integration where wide-area surface dosimetry is required.</description>

      <title>Real-time 3D Ultrasonic Needle Tracking with a Photoacoustic Beacon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interventional ultrasound system capable of simultaneous 3D tracking and B-mode guidance of a novel, trackable needle core biopsy tool. Interventional radiology procedures such as core needle biopsy of focal liver lesions are ideally performed under ultrasound guidance, during which having a clear understanding of the location of the needle tip is essential to avoid adverse events and the need for repeat procedures. However, the 3D nature of the procedure and poor image contrast of the needle in heterogeneous tissue or at steep insertion angles often leads to confusion over the true location of the tip relative to the ultrasound imaging plane. This leads services to rely ionising, slow and expensive X-ray computed tomography guidance and/or senior clinicians for risky or otherwise challenging procedures. Existing methods to enhance needle visibility largely remain limited to 2D, and do not offer real-time volumetric guidance. Our proposed system provides the clinician with a real-time, quantitative visualisation of the 3D location of the needle tip superimposed onto B-mode ultrasound images. The tip location is determined from the time-of-flight of ultrasound generated by a photoacoustic beacon embedded in the needle bevel and received by a sparse receiver array distributed around the imaging system's curvilinear ultrasound probe. The performance of the system was assessed both in water and in an ex vivo tissue phantom, with referenced positions derived from X-ray computed tomography. The usability of the system was assessed by 12 clinicians performing simulated biopsies on a second ex vivo tissue phantom.</description>

      <title>What is Implementation Science; and Why It Matters for Bridging the Artificial Intelligence Innovation-to-Application Gap in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical Imaging (MI) is well recognized. Yet despite promising reports in research settings, many AI tools fail to achieve clinical adoption in practice. In fact, more generally, there is a documented 17-year average delay between evidence generation and implementation of a technology. Implementation science (IS) may provide a practical, evidence-based framework to bridge the gap between AI development and real-world clinical imaging use, to shorten this lag through systematic frameworks, strategies, and hybrid research designs. We outline challenges specific to AI adoption in MI workflows, including infrastructural, educational, and cultural barriers. We highlight the complementary roles of effectiveness research and implementation research, emphasizing hybrid study designs and the role of integrated KT (iKT), stakeholder engagement, and equity-focused co-creation in designing sustainable and generalizable solutions. We discuss integration of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) frameworks in MI towards usable AI. Adopting IS is not only a methodological advancement; it is a strategic imperative for accelerating translation of innovation into improved patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation - bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>
