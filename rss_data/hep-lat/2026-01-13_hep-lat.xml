      <title>Phase structure of heavy dense lattice QCD and three-state Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the finite temperature phase transition of QCD depends on the particle density and the mass of the dynamical quarks. We discuss the properties of the phase transition at high-density, considering an effective theory describing the high-density heavy-quark limit of QCD. This effective theory is a simple model in which the Polyakov loop is a dynamical variable, and the quark Boltzmann factor is controlled by only one parameter, $C(\mu,m_q)$, which is a function of the quark mass $m_q$ and the chemical potential $\mu$. The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy-quark region. As the density varies from $\mu=0$ to $\mu=\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD determination of the $\gamma Z$ box contribution to the proton weak charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $\gamma Z$ box contribution to parity-violating electron-proton scattering, $\square_{\gamma Z}$ , a key ingredient for the precise tests of the Standard Model via the proton weak charge. Our calculation covers the electron beam energies up to $E =155 MeV$. For the axial-vector component, we achieve reduced uncertainties across the entire energy range compared with phenomenological estimates. For the vector component, the uncertainties remain slightly larger after continuum extrapolation. At $E = 0$, where the vector part vanishes, we obtain $\square_{\gamma Z}= 0.00412(9)$ , reducing the uncertainty by a factor of $2$ relative to the most precise previous determination. Incorporating this result yields an updated weak charge of $Q_{W}^{p}= 0.06987(50)$ . The calculated energy dependence of $\square_{\gamma Z}$ further provides a first-principles input for the upcoming P2 experiment at Mainz, which will operate at the optimized beam energy of $155 MeV$ to extract $Q_{W}^p$.</description>

      <title>Heavy hadron spectrum from 2+1+1 flavor MILC lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mass spectra and various mass differences of heavy hadrons containing one or more bottom quarks using MILC's $N_f = 2+1+1$ HISQ gauge ensembles at three lattice spacings. For the valence quarks, we employ a combination of lattice actions: the NRQCD action is used for bottom quarks, the anisotropic Clover action for charm quarks, and the $O(a)$-improved Wilson--Clover action for strange and lighter (up/down) quarks. Heavy hadron operators with at least one bottom quark are constructed by considering all possible combinations with charm, strange, and light quarks corresponding to various quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase should be ``kinematical'' singularities. We conjecture that the SMG interactions generate opposite-chirality bound states, which combine with the gapped elementary mirror states to form massive Dirac fermions. The propagator zeros can then be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we formulate a generalized no-go theorem which establishes the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. We also elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models. Finally, we compile a list of open questions which must be addressed in any SMG model in order to determine whether or not it is subject to the generalized no-go theorem.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the nature of axial-vector charm-antibottom tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the electromagnetic characteristics of unconventional states may offer new insights into their internal structures. In particular, the magnetic moment attributes may serve as a crucial physical observable for differentiating exotic states with disparate configurations or spin-parity quantum numbers. As a promising avenue for research, encompassing both opportunities and challenges, an in-depth examination of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is crucial for advancing our understanding of unconventional states. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of $ \rm{I(J^{P})} = 1(1^{+})$ $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states are analyzed in the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules by considering the diquark-antidiquark approximation, designated as type $3_c \otimes \bar 3_c$. Although the tetraquark states examined in this study have nearly identical masses, their magnetic moment results exhibit noticeable discrepancies. This may facilitate the differentiation between quantum numbers associated with states with identical quark content. The results show that heavy quarks overcoming light quarks can determine both the sign and the magnitude of the magnetic moments of these tetraquark states. The numerical results obtained in this study suggest that the magnetic moments of $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may reveal aspects of their underlying structure, which could distinguish between their spin-parity quantum numbers and their internal structure. The results obtained regarding the magnetic moments of the $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may be checked within the context of different phenomenological approaches.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic tomography of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ hidden-charm strange pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how quarks are spatially arranged inside exotic pentaquarks remains one of the key open problems in contemporary hadron spectroscopy. The electromagnetic multipole moments of hadrons provide a direct probe of their internal quark--gluon geometry and spatial charge distributions. Motivated by this, we employ QCD light-cone sum rules to compute the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $J^P = 3/2^-$ pentaquark with strangeness $S = -1$. Five distinct diquark--diquark--antiquark interpolating currents are constructed to explore possible internal configurations. The resulting electromagnetic moments exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the underlying quark arrangement: magnetic dipole moments range from $-2.28\mu_N$ to $+3.36\mu_N$, establishing this observable as a key discriminator among configurations with identical quantum numbers. Nonzero electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments indicate clear deviations from spherical symmetry, while a detailed decomposition shows that light quarks dominate the magnetic response and the charm quark drives quadrupole deformation. These findings position electromagnetic multipole moments as quantitative and discriminating probes of exotic hadron structure, providing concrete benchmarks for forthcoming LHCb, Belle~II, and lattice QCD studies.</description>

      <title>Local gauge-invariant vector operators in the adjoint $SU(2)$ Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we scrutinize local gauge-invariant vector operators of dimension four in the adjoint $SU(2)$ Higgs model, which are candidates for interpolating fields of the fundamental excitations of the model due to the so-called FMS mechanism. We use the equations of motion and the properties of the BRST operator to derive a Ward identity that allows us to determine whether a given operator can propagate. To corroborate this analysis, we explicitly compute the two-point function of the non-propagating operator at the one-loop level.</description>
