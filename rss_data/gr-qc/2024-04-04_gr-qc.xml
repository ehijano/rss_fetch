      <title>Scalar induced gravitational waves in metric teleparallel gravity with the Nieh-Yan term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in metric teleparallel gravity with the Nieh-Yan (NY) term, which results in parity violation during the radiation-dominated era. By solving the equations of motion of linear scalar perturbations from both the metric and tetrad fields, we obtain the corresponding analytic expressions. Then, we calculate the SIGWs in metric teleparallel gravity with the NY term and evaluate the energy density of SIGWs with a monochromatic power spectrum numerically. We find that the spectrum of the energy density of SIGWs in metric teleparallel gravity with the NY term is significantly different from that in general relativity (GR), which makes metric teleparallel gravity distinguishable from GR.</description>

      <title>Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if it is the past endpoint of causal curves in spacetime. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [1], and Goswami and Joshi [2], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [1] and [2]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [3] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC then gives a sufficient condition ensuring that the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, are of strong curvature type and hence correspond to the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [4] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Traversable Wormhole Solutions in Modified $f(R)$ Gravity with Scalar Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this manuscript is to investigate the traversable wormhole solutions in the background of the $f(R, \phi)$ theory of gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\phi$ is the scalar potential respectively. For this reason, we use the Karmarkar criterion for traversable static wormhole geometry to create a wormhole shape function. The suggested shape function creates wormhole geometry that links two asymptotically flat spacetime regions and meets the necessary requirements. The embedding diagram in three-dimensional Euclidean space is also discussed in order to demonstrate the wormhole configurations. For our current analysis, we choose the suitable values of free parameters for $f(R, \phi)$ gravity models to discuss the wormhole geometry. It can be observed that our proposed shape function provides the wormhole solutions with less amount of exotic matter. It can be noticed that energy conditions especially null energy conditions are violated for all considered models. The violation of energy conditions indicates the existence of exotic matter and wormhole geometry. It is concluded that the shape function acquired through the Karmarkar technique yields validated wormhole configurations with even less exotic matter correlating to the chosen $f(R, \phi)$ gravity models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Stability in New General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the degrees of freedom in New General Relativity -- flat and metric compatible family of theories -- around the Minkowski background in a gauge invariant manner. First, we confirm the decoupling case, in which the theory reduces to linearized gravity plus a massless KR field. We then show that, unless they vanish, the vector modes of this theory will be ghosts. In addition, we find two new branches of the theories, which are ghost-free and propagate linearly two tensor modes and in one of the cases also a massless scalar field. This shows that while the generic theory is ill-behaved, there are three possible realizations of ghost-free cases, in contradiction to the previous literature, which states that there is only one ghost-free theory in addition to general relativity.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Warp Drive Spacetimes with Warp Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of warp research has been dominated by analytical methods to investigate potential solutions. However, these approaches often favor simple metric forms that facilitate analysis but ultimately limit the range of exploration of novel solutions. So far the proposed solutions have been unphysical, requiring energy condition violations and large energy requirements. To overcome the analytical limitations in warp research, we introduce Warp Factory: a numerical toolkit designed for modeling warp drive spacetimes. By leveraging numerical analysis, Warp Factory enables the examination of general warp drive geometries by evaluating the Einstein field equations and computing energy conditions. Furthermore, this comprehensive toolkit provides the determination of metric scalars and insightful visualizations in both 2D and 3D, offering a deeper understanding of metrics and their corresponding stress-energy tensors. The paper delves into the methodology employed by Warp Factory in evaluating the physicality of warp drive spacetimes and highlights its application in assessing commonly modeled warp drive metrics. By leveraging the capabilities of Warp Factory, we aim to further warp drive research and hopefully bring us closer to realizing physically achievable warp drives.</description>

      <title>The Role of Torsion in Trans-Planckian Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The torsion of spacetime, if exists, plays an important role at the very early universe when the spin density of particles was very high. It is generally believed that in extremely high energies of the early universe a new physics called trans-Planckian physics should be considered. Since the initial conditions for inflation are probably a result of this new physics, here we consider spin and torsion as trans- Planckian effects and analyze their influence on the power spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations at the end of the inflationary era.</description>

      <title>A comparison between the deflection angles of massive and massless particles in the Shchwarzschild space-time and their consequences on black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comparisons of the deflection angles of massless and massive particles in the Schwarzschild space-time. For the case of photons in a general static space-time, we construct a spatial 3D equation of motion for their path that leads to an implicit formula for the deflection angle. We then compare our results with well known results of the literature in the Schwarzschild space-time. For the case of massive particles we calculate the deflection angle only in the Schwarzschild space-time. The end result is that as the velocity of any massive particle diminishes, the deflection angle increases. To show the relevance of these comparisons, we constructed different black hole shadows for massive particles in order to be compared with a shadow made by of photons.</description>

      <title>High energy head-on particle collisions near event horizons: classifcation of scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider head-on collisions of two particles near the event horizon. Particle 1 is outgoing, particle 2 is ingoing. We elucidate, in which case the energy $E_{c.m.}$ in the center of mass frame can grow unbounded. If the proper time between the horizon and an arbitrary point outside it for particle 1 is finite, we deal with a white hole. If it is infinite, we deal with a black hole. Particles can be either free or experience the action of a finite force. Our results are complementary to those for the standard BSW effect when particles move in the same direction. The results rely on classification of particles developed in our previous work H.V. Ovcharenko, O.B. Zaslavskii, Phys. Rev. D 108, 064029 (2023).</description>

      <title>Testing the Boundary-to-Bound Correspondence with Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boundary-to-Bound (B2B) correspondence, which connects orbital and radiative observables between bound and unbound orbits, has recently been introduced and demonstrated in the perturbative regime. We produce a large number of numerical relativity simulations of bound and unbound encounters between two nonspinning equal mass black holes in order to test this correspondence in the non-perturbative regime. We focus on testing the radiated energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital parameters such as the period and periastron advance. We find that, across a wide range of eccentricities, the B2B relationships do not hold in the non-perturbative regime, thereby placing a clear limit on the applicability of these relationships. We also approximate the separatrix between bound and unbound relativistic encounters as a function of their initial energies and angular momenta.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goto equation from three-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the solutions of three-dimensional gravity obtained by gluing two copies of a spacetime across a junction constituted of a tensile string are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation in the same spacetime up to a finite number of rigid deformations. The non-linear Nambu-Goto equation satisfied by the average of the embedding coordinates of the junction emerges directly from the junction conditions along with the rigid deformations and corrections due to the tension. Therefore, the equivalence principle generalizes non-trivially to the string. Our results are valid both in three-dimensional flat and AdS spacetimes. In the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, our setup could be used to describe a class of interfaces in the conformal field theory featuring relative time reparametrization at the interface which encodes the solution of the Nambu-Goto equation corresponding to the bulk junction.</description>

      <title>Sledgehamr: Simulating Scalar Fields with Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the non-linear dynamics of coupled scalar fields often necessitates simulations on a three-dimensional mesh. These simulations can be computationally expensive if a large scale separation is involved. A common solution is adaptive mesh refinement which, however, greatly increases a simulation's complexity. In this work, we present sledgehamr, an AMReX-based code package to make the simulation of coupled scalar fields on an adaptive mesh more accessible. Compatible with both GPU and CPU clusters, sledgehamr offers a flexible and customizable framework. While the code had been primarily developed to evolve axion string networks, this framework enables various other applications, such as the study of gravitational waves sourced by the dynamics of scalar fields.</description>

      <title>The cosmological constant and the weak gravity conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the descent via membrane nucleation through a landscape of vacua where the cosmological constant is given by a combination of four-form fluxes. It has been shown that this descent can be slowed exponentially for very low curvature vacua close to Minkowski space in a wide class of models satisfying certain parametric conditions, providing a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem. We explore in detail whether or not those parametric conditions are compatible with the membrane weak gravity conjecture. Whilst it is true that there is often tension, we show that this is not always the case and present an explicit model where Minkowski space is absolutely stable and the weak gravity conjecture is satisfied. This corresponds to an extension of the Bousso-Polchinski model into a generalised DBI action for four-forms. We also clarify how the landscape should be populated in a consistent model.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Instability of Charged Extremal Black Holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study charged scalar perturbations of charged extremal black holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld theory. Our numerical results indicate that these black holes all suffer from superradiant instability by the unstable quasi-bound states, regardless how small the coupling constant is. We therefore provide a new example that the superradiant stability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole is a fine-tuned result, as in the case when it is embedded in the STU supergravity model. The work is also motivated by the weak gravity conjecture since at the linear coupling constant level, the theory belongs to a subsect of four-derivative corrections in the effective field theory. Our results appear to support the notion that the black holes do decay when gravity is weaker by the correction, but the decaying halftime requires nonlinear effects and cannot be seen at the level of linear coupling constant. The full nonlinear effects also indicate that the black holes can decay even when gravity is stronger.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify, for SO(3)-symmetric 4-dimensional Berwald-Finsler spaces of indefinite signature, the question of the existence of an affinely equivalent pseudo-Riemannian metric. It turns out that the answer depends on the holonomy distribution of the canonical affine connection and on the symmetry of its Ricci tensor. In particular, we find all classes of 4-dimensional SO(3)-invariant, symmetric affine connections which do not arise as Levi-Civita connections of any pseudo-Riemannian metric, but can still be metrized by (SO(3)-symmetric) Finsler functions; in Lorentzian signature, these will provide Berwald spacetime structures whose geodesic structure cannot be ascribed to any Lorentzian metric. Some concrete examples are also presented.</description>

      <title>On the Charge Algebra of Causal Diamonds in Three Dimensional Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covariant phase space methods are applied to the analysis of a causal diamond in 2+1-dimensional pure Einstein gravity. It is found that the reduced phase space is parametrized by a family of charges with a dual geometrical interpretation: they are geometric observables on the corner of the diamond, and they generate diffeomorphisms. The Poisson brackets among them close into an algebra. Knowledge of the corner charges therefore permits reconstruction of the diamond geometry, which realizes a form of local holography. The results are contrasted with the literature, and the path to a quantum description of spacetime geometry is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the possibility of a past and future eternal universe, constructing geodesically complete inflating, loitering, and bouncing spacetimes. We identify the constraints energy conditions in General Relativity place on the building of eternal cosmological models. Inflationary and bouncing behavior are shown to be essential ingredients in all significant examples. Non-trivial complete spacetimes are shown to violate the null energy condition (NEC) for at least some amount of time, although, some obey the average null energy condition. Ignoring the intractable subtleties introduced by quantum considerations, such as rare tunneling events and Boltzmann brains, we demonstrate that these universes need not have had a beginning or an end.</description>

These sources have historically been referred to as "verification binaries" under the assumption that they will be exploited to assess mission performance. This paper quantitatively interrogates that scenario by considering targeted analyses of known galactic sources in the context of a full simulation of the galactic gravitational wave foreground. We find that the analysis of the best currently known LISA binaries, even making maximal use of the available information about the sources, is susceptible to ambiguity or biases when not simultaneously fitting to the rest of the galactic population. While galactic binaries discovered electromagnetically in advance of, or during, the LISA survey are highly valuable multimessenger systems, the need for a global treatment of the galactic gravitational wave foreground calls into question whether or not they are the best sources for data characterization.</description>

      <title>Matter waves and clocks do not observe uniform gravitational fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a uniform gravitational field, classical test objects fall universally. Any reference object or observer will fall in the same universal manner. Therefore, a uniform gravitational field cannot create dynamics between observers and classical test objects. The influence of a uniform gravitational field on matter waves and clocks, however, is described inconsistently throughout research and education. To illustrate, we discuss the behavior of a matter-wave interferometer and a clock redshift experiment in a uniform gravitational field. As a consistent formulation of the equivalence principle implies, a uniform gravitational field has no observable influence on these systems and is physically equivalent to the absence of gravity.</description>

      <title>Simulating Holographic Conformal Field Theories on Hyperbolic Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with nonlinear dynamics universally lead to a genuine realization of the bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>On type-II Spacetimes and the Double Copy for Fluids Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper (arXiv:2005.04242) we discussed type-D and type-N fluid-dual spacetimes and provided their associated single copies in the context of the Weyl double copy. In this work we extend our analysis to more general fluids thereby requiring the application of the double copy picture to type-II space-times. By combining our previous type-D and type-N fluids via their associated stream functions we demonstrate an example of a viable type-II double copy. Further we use an explicitly perturbative approach in the near horizon expansion to generalize the type II double copy for the fluid-dual space-times. We show a Maxwell spinor ansatz containing a heterogeneous bi-spinor component is necessary to provide a viable type-II double copy at the lowest order.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Interpretation in Subsolar Mass Gravitational Wave Candidate SSM200308</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute $3.54^{+7.66}_{-2.82}\times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert problems, Toeplitz operators and ergosurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach, in conjunction with the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices, enables one to obtain explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories. These solutions are encoded in the elements of a matrix $M$ depending on the Weyl coordinates $\rho$ and $v$, determined by that factorisation. We address here, for the first time, the underlying question of what happens when a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation does not exist, using the close connection of Wiener-Hopf factorisation with Toeplitz operators to study this question. For the case of rational monodromy matrices, we prove that the non-existence of a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation determines curves in the $(\rho,v)$ plane on which some elements of $M(\rho,v)$ tend to infinity, but where the space-time metric may still be well behaved. In the case of uncharged rotating black holes in four space-time dimensions and, for certain choices of coordinates, in five space-time dimensions, we show that these curves correspond to their ergosurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than a century ago, Albert Einstein presented his general theory of gravitation (GR) to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. One of the predictions of the theory is that not only particles and objects with mass, but also the quanta of light, photons, are tied to the curvature of space-time, and thus to gravity. There must be a critical mass density, above which photons cannot escape. These are black holes (henceforth BH). It took fifty years after the theory was announced before possible candidate objects were identified by observational astronomy. And another fifty years have passed, until we finally have in hand detailed and credible experimental evidence that BHs of 10 to 10^10 times the mass of the Sun exist in the Universe. Three very different experimental techniques, but all based on Michelson interferometry or Fourier-inversion spatial interferometry have enabled the critical experimental breakthroughs. It has now become possible to investigate the space-time structure in the vicinity of the event horizons of BHs. We briefly summarize these interferometric techniques, and discuss the spectacular recent improvements achieved with all three techniques. Finally, we sketch where the path of exploration and inquiry may go on in the next decades.</description>

      <title>The dilaton gravity hologram of double-scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We work out a precise holographic duality between sine dilaton gravity, and DSSYK. More precisely, canonical quantization of sine dilaton gravity reproduces q-Schwarzian quantum mechanics, which is the auxiliary system that arises from the chord diagrams of DSSYK. The role of the chord number in DSSYK is played by the (Weyl rescaled) geodesic length in the bulk. The most puzzling aspect of reconciling DSSYK with a simple gravitational dual at the classical level is the distinction between temperature and "fake temperature". At the q-Schwarzian level, we clarify how this arises from the constraint that the chord number is positive. The on-shell q-Schwarzian action with the constraint reproduces the thermodynamics of DSSYK. Semi-classically, in sine dilaton gravity this translates to the insertion of a defect, from which we deduce that fake temperature is the Hawking temperature of a smooth Lorentzian black hole. We comment on several relations with dS space. One remarkable feature is that in sine dilaton gravity quantization discretizes spacetime, therefore the Hilbert space is discrete.</description>

      <title>Deformation-induced CPT violation in entangled pairs of neutral kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider description of kaon -- anti-kaon interference in the context of a theory with deformed $\cal CPT$ symmetry. In the case of such theoretical models, deviations from the standard $\cal CPT$ invariance is related to the momentum carried by the particles; in particular the rest masses of particles and antiparticles are equal. We find that the decay intensity of kaon -- anti-kaon pair has three contributing terms: the correct-parity, the wrong-parity, and the interference between them, all of which are affected by deformation. Using the fact that the presence of such terms were not observed we estimate the magnitude of deformation parameter $\kappa \gtrsim 10^{18}$ GeV, very close to the expected Planck mass scale. This raises hopes that the effect, if exists, could be detected in a near future accelerator experiments. An uncertainty of the energy measurement is crucial for accuracy of these predictions.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Pantheon SNeIa data in the context of Barrow's variable speed of light</title>

Abstract: We analyze the Combined Pantheon Sample of Type Ia supernovae while allowing the velocity of light to vary as a function of the scale factor $c\propto a^{-\zeta}$, as initiated by Barrow [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. The variation in the velocity of light creates an effect akin to the refraction phenomenon which occurs for a wave traveling in a medium with varying speed of wave. We elucidate the role of the local scale of gravitationally-bound regions in assisting the refraction effect to manifest. The refraction effect alters the redshift formulae (Lemaitre, distance-vs-z, luminosity distance-vs-z) and warrants a new analysis of the Pantheon dataset. Upon a reformulation of the distance-redshift relations, we achieve a high-quality fit of the Pantheon dataset to the variable light speed approach; the fit is as robust as that obtained in the standard $\Lambda CDM$ model. We find that the Pantheon dataset is consistent with the variable light speed of the functional form: $a\propto t^{\mu}$ and $c\propto a^{1-1/\mu}$ with (i) the cosmic age $t_{0}\approx 13.9$ Gy as a free parameter, while $\mu$ is unspecified; and (ii) a monotonic variation in the local scale for gravitationally-bound objects (applicable to the emission sources and the Solar System-based apparatus/observer). Due to the agent in (ii), the high-z portion of the Pantheon dataset would produce an "effective" $H_{0}$ estimate which is 10 percent lower than the $H_{0}$ estimate obtained from the low-z portion of the dataset. We offer an alternative interpretation of the accelerating expansion by way of variable speed of light, and as a by-product of the agent uncovered in (ii), a tentative suggestion toward "resolving" the ongoing tension in the Hubble constant estimates.</description>

Abstract: We present a model of relativistic elastic stars featuring scale invariance. This implies a linear mass-radius relation and the absence of a maximum mass. The most compact spherically symmetric configuration that is radially stable and satisfies all energy and causality conditions has a slightly smaller radius than the Schwarzschild light ring radius. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first material compact object with such remarkable properties in General Relativity, which makes it a unique candidate for a black-hole mimicker.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this review it to present a renewed perspective of the problem of self-gravitating elastic bodies under spherical symmetry. It is also a companion to the papers [Phys. Rev. D105, 044025 (2022)], [Phys. Rev. D106, L041502 (2022)], and [arXiv:2306.16584 [gr-qc]], where we introduced a new definition of spherically symmetric elastic bodies in general relativity, and applied it to investigate the existence and physical viability, including radial stability, of static self-gravitating elastic balls. We focus on elastic materials that generalize fluids with polytropic, linear, and affine equations of state, and discuss the symmetries of the energy density function, including homogeneity and the resulting scale invariance of the TOV equations. By introducing invariant characterizations of physical admissible initial data, we numerically construct mass-radius-compactness diagrams, and conjecture about the maximum compactness of stable physically admissible elastic balls.</description>

Abstract: Tachyons or hypothetical faster-than-light (FTL) particles would fail the principle of causality. Such particles may only be imagined when they have no energy and momentum and, thus, no observable interaction. In this paper, we show that the classical relativistic field theory with non-standard Lagrangian densities (k-field models) does not rule out the existence of FTL particle-like solutions (solitons) with zero energy and momentum in 3+1 dimensions. However, contrary to our expectation, we show that it is possible to have k-field models that lead to energetic FTL soliton solutions in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

Abstract: It has been claimed in I. Arraut, 2023 EPL 144 29003 [arXiv:2311.05652] that General Relativity can generate effects equivalent to dark matter, based on a "new modified symmetry that emerges at galactic scale". We show that (i) the spacetime considered is unphysical, violating energy conditions everywhere; (ii) actually no new symmetry emerges, which results from incorrect definitions of angular momentum, velocity, and arclength in the proposed geometry; (iii) no Tully-Fisher law, or flat rotation curves are obtained either, they simply result from a series of errors in the equations.</description>

      <title>Semi-Symmetric Metric Gravity: from the Friedmann-Schouten geometry with torsion to dynamical dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we introduce a geometric generalization of standard general relativity, based on a geometry initially introduced by Friedmann and Schouten in 1924, through the notion of a semi-symmetric connection. The semi-symmetric connection is a particular connection that extends the Levi-Civita one, by allowing for the presence of torsion. While the mathematical landscape of the semi-symmetric metric connections is well-explored, their physical implications remain to be investigated. After presenting in detail the differential geometric aspects of the geometries with semi-symmetric metric connection, we formulate the Einstein field equations, which contain additional terms induced by the presence of the specific form of torsion we are studying. We consider the cosmological applications of the theory by deriving the generalized Friedmann equations, which also include some supplementary terms as compared to their general relativistic counterparts and can be interpreted as a geometric type dark energy. To evaluate the proposed theory, we consider three cosmological models - the first with constant effective density and pressure, the second with the dark energy satisfying a linear equation of state, and a third one one with a polytropic equation of state. We compare the predictions of the semi-symmetric metric gravitational theory with the observational data for the Hubble function, and with the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings indicate that the semi-symmetric metric cosmological models give a good description of the observational data, and for certain values of the model parameters, they can reproduce almost exactly the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Consequently, Friedmann's initially proposed geometry emerges as a credible alternative to standard general relativity, in which dark energy has a purely geometric origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the perturbative, fully explicit, analytical behaviour of photon escape cones in the Kerr spacetime. When one conducts the fully general non-perturbative Kerr analysis, one quickly finds that one must at some point appeal to numerical and/or graphical methods. Herein we find that we are able to say much more if we look at the slow rotation limit (i.e., $a \ll m$). Indeed we give explicit and tractable expressions for the first and second order (in $a$) contributions to both the shape of the escape cone, and the solid angle subtended by the escape cone. We then look at a few special cases at each order, thereby leading to explicit expressions for the black hole silhouette, expressions which are of great interest to the observational community when studying images of black hole silhouettes ("shadows").</description>

Abstract: We study the degrees of freedom of the Proca theory, non-minimally coupled to gravity. In the Minkowski background, this theory propagates five degrees of freedom - a massive longitudinal mode, two massive vector ones, and two massless tensor modes. At first sight, the non-linear coupling between the metric perturbations and the vector field indicates that both longitudinal and tensor modes become strongly coupled, at the same scale. This would imply that no matter how small the photon mass is if non-minimal coupling is taken into account, gravitational waves would necessarily be strongly coupled. We show that the way out of this inconsistency is through the introduction of the disformal coupling to the metric perturbations that resemble the vector-type disformal transformations. This way, the unphysical coupling between the two types of modes can be avoided, rendering the model consistent. As a result, we show that only the longitudinal modes enter a strong coupling regime, while both tensor and transverse modes remain weakly coupled at all scales up to the Planck length. Finally, we show how this cures recently reported runaway modes in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Big-Bounce as a phenomenology of RQM in the Mini-superspace</title>

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a quantum Big-Bounce in the context of an isotropic Universe, filled by a self-interacting scalar field, which plays the role of a physical clock. The bouncing cosmology is the result of a scattering process, driven by the scalar field potential, which presence breaks down the frequency separation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, treated in strict analogy to a relativistic quantum system. Differently from previous analyses, we consider a really perturbative self-interaction potential, affecting the dynamics in a finite range of the time labeled by the scalar clock (and in particular we remove the divergent character previously allowed). The main result of the present analysis is that, when the Relativistic Quantum Mechanics formalism is properly implemented in the Mini-superspace analogy, the probability amplitude for the bounce is, both in the standard and polymerized case, characterized by a maximum in correspondence of the quasi-classical condition of a Universe minimum volume.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Microlensing on Gravitational Wave Signals: Biases, Population Characteristics, and Prospects for Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of microlensing on gravitational wave (GW) signals in the LIGO$-$Virgo sensitivity band. Microlensing caused by an isolated point lens, with (redshifted) mass ranging from $M_\mathrm{Lz}\in(1,10^5){\rm M}_\odot$ and impact parameter $y\in (0.01,~5)$, can result in a maximum mismatch of $\sim 30\%$ with their unlensed counterparts. When $y&lt;1$, it strongly anti-correlates with the luminosity distance enhancing the detection horizon and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Biases in inferred source parameters are assessed, with in-plane spin components being the most affected intrinsic parameters. The luminosity distance is often underestimated, while sky-localisation and trigger times are mostly well-recovered. Study of a population of microlensed signals due to an isolated point lens primarily reveals: (i) using unlensed templates during the search causes fractional loss ($20\%$ to $30\%$) of potentially identifiable microlensed signals; (ii) the observed distribution of $y$ challenges the notion of its high improbability at low values ($y\lesssim 1$), especially for $y\lesssim 0.1$; (iii) Bayes factor analysis of the population indicates that certain region in $M_\mathrm{Lz}-y$ parameter space have a higher probability of being detected and accurately identified as microlensed. Notably, the microlens parameters for the most compelling candidate identified in previous microlensing searches, GW200208_130117, fall within a 1-sigma range of the aforementioned higher probability region. Identifying microlensing signatures from $M_\mathrm{Lz}&lt;100~$M$_\odot$ remains challenging due to small microlensing effects at typical SNR values. Additionally, we also examined how microlensing from a population of microlenses influences the detection of strong lensing signatures in pairs of GW events, particularly in the posterior-overlap analysis.</description>

      <title>Rotation Curve Fitting Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One key piece of evidence for dark matter is the flat rotation curve problem: the disagreement between measured galactic rotation curves and their luminous mass. A novel solution to this problem is presented here. A model of relativistic frame effects on Doppler shifts due to the slightly curved frames of an emitting galaxy and the Milky Way is derived. This model predicts observed Doppler shifted spectra (in excess of the luminous mass) based only on the observed luminous matter profile and one free model parameter. Fits to the 175 galaxies reported in the SPARC database of galactic rotation profiles and accurate photometry measurements are compared between this novel model and dark matter and MOND (RAR) models. We find on the SPARC sample of 175 galaxies; that MOND-RAR has an average reduced chisquare of $\chi^2_r = 4.22$ for 175 galaxies fitted, the isothermal dark matter model has $\chi^2_r = 1.90$ for 165 galaxies fitted, and the new model we present has $\chi^2_r = 2.39$ for 172 galaxies fitted. Implications of this model are discussed.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Enhanced Optical Spring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the generation of enhanced optical springs using the optical Kerr effect. A nonlinear optical crystal is inserted into a Fabry-Perot cavity with a movable mirror, and a chain of second-order nonlinear optical effects in the phase-mismatched condition induces the Kerr effect. The optical spring constant is enhanced by a factor of $1.6\pm0.1$ over linear theory. To our knowledge, this is the first realization of optomechanical coupling enhancement using a nonlinear optical effect, which has been theoretically investigated to overcome the performance limitations of linear optomechanical systems. The tunable nonlinearity of demonstrated system has a wide range of potential applications, from observing gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star post-merger remnants to cooling macroscopic oscillators to their quantum ground state.</description>

      <title>On the IR Divergences in de Sitter Space: loops, resummation and the semi-classical wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the infrared (IR) divergences in de Sitter (dS) space using the wavefunction method, and explicitly explore how the resummation of higher-order loops leads to the stochastic formalism. In light of recent developments of the cosmological bootstrap, we track the behaviour of these nontrivial IR effects from perturbation theory to the non-perturbative regime. Specifically, we first examine the perturbative computation of wavefunction coefficients, and show that there is a clear distinction between classical components from tree-level diagrams and quantum ones from loop processes. Cosmological correlators at loop level receive contributions from tree-level wavefunction coefficients, which we dub classical loops. This distinction significantly simplifies the analysis of loop-level IR divergences, as we find the leading contributions always come from these classical loops. Then we compare with correlators from the perturbative stochastic computation, and find the results there are essentially the ones from classical loops, while quantum loops are only present as subleading corrections. This demonstrates that the leading IR effects are contained in the semi-classical wavefunction which is a resummation of all the tree-level diagrams. With this insight, we go beyond perturbation theory and present a new derivation of the stochastic formalism using the saddle-point approximation. We show that the Fokker-Planck equation follows as a consequence of two effects: the drift from the Schr\"odinger equation that describes the bulk time evolution, and the diffusion from the Polchinski's equation which corresponds to the exact renormalization group flow of the coarse-grained theory on the boundary. Our analysis highlights the precise and simple link between the stochastic formalism and the semi-classical wavefunction.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Precision Test of General Relativity using Bright Standard Sirens from ongoing and upcoming detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a new avenue to test Einstein's General Relativity (GR) using the ongoing and upcoming GW detectors by measuring the redshift evolution of the effective Planck mass proposed by several modified theories of gravity. We propose a model-independent, data-driven approach to measure any deviation from GR in the GW propagation effect by combining multi-messenger observations of GW sources accompanied by EM counterparts, commonly known as bright sirens (Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and Neutron Star Black Hole systems (NSBH)). We show that by combining the GW luminosity distance measurements from bright sirens with the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements derived from galaxy clustering, and the sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can make a data-driven reconstruction of deviation of the variation of the effective Planck mass (jointly with the Hubble constant) as a function of cosmic redshift. Using this technique, we achieve a precise measurement of GR with redshift (z) with a precision of approximately $7.9\%$ for BNSs at redshift z=0.075 and $10\%$ for NSBHs at redshift z=0.225 with 5 years of observation from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network of detectors. Employing Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope for just 1 year yields the best precision of about $1.62\%$ for BNSs and $2\%$ for NSBHs at redshift z=0.5 on the evolution of the frictional term, and a similar precision up to z=1. This measurement can discover potential deviation from any kind of model that impacts GW propagation with ongoing and upcoming observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study closed universes in simple models of two dimensional gravity, such as Jackiw-Teiteilboim (JT) gravity coupled to matter, and a toy topological model that captures the key features of the former. We find there is a stark contrast, as well as some connections, between the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of the theory. We find rich semi-classical physics. However, when non-perturbative effects are included there is a unique closed universe state in each theory. We discuss possible meanings and interpretations of this observation.</description>

      <title>New Well-Posed Boundary Conditions for Semi-Classical Euclidean Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional Euclidean gravity in a finite cavity. Dirichlet conditions do not yield a well-posed elliptic system, and Anderson has suggested boundary conditions that do. Here we point out that there exists a one-parameter family of boundary conditions, parameterized by a constant $p$, where a suitably Weyl rescaled boundary metric is fixed, and all give a well-posed elliptic system. Anderson and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be seen as the limits $p \to 0$ and $\infty$ of these. Focussing on static Euclidean solutions, we derive a thermodynamic first law. Restricting to a spherical spatial boundary, the infillings are flat space or the Schwarzschild solution, and have similar thermodynamics to the Dirichlet case. We consider smooth Euclidean fluctuations about the flat space saddle; for $p &gt; 1/6$ the spectrum of the Lichnerowicz operator is stable -- its eigenvalues have positive real part. Thus we may regard large $p$ as a regularization of the ill-posed Dirichlet boundary conditions. However for $p &lt; 1/6$ there are unstable modes, even in the spherically symmetric and static sector. We then turn to Lorentzian signature. For $p &lt; 1/6$ we may understand this spherical Euclidean instability as being paired with a Lorentzian instability associated with the dynamics of the boundary itself. However, a mystery emerges when we consider perturbations that break spherical symmetry. Here we find a plethora of dynamically unstable modes even for $p &gt; 1/6$, contrasting starkly with the Euclidean stability we found. Thus we seemingly obtain a system with stable thermodynamics, but unstable dynamics, calling into question the standard assumption of smoothness that we have implemented when discussing the Euclidean theory.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_3$/ICFT$_2$ with a dynamical scalar field located on the brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit holographic duality to study the system of a one-dimensional interface contacting two semi-infinite two-dimensional CFTs. Central to our investigation is the introduction of a dynamical scalar field located on the bulk interface brane which breaks the scaling symmetry of the dual interface field theory, along with its consequential backreaction on the system. We define an interface entropy from holographic entanglement entropy. At zero temperature we construct several illustrative examples and observe that the $g$-theorem is always satisfied. These examples also reveal distinct features of the interface entropy that are intricately linked to the scalar potential profiles. At finite temperature we find that the dynamical scalar field enables the bulk theory to have new configurations which would be infeasible solely with a tension term on the interface brane.</description>
