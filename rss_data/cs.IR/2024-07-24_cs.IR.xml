      <title>Pareto Front Approximation for Multi-Objective Session-Based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces MultiTRON, an approach that adapts Pareto front approximation techniques to multi-objective session-based recommender systems using a transformer neural network. Our approach optimizes trade-offs between key metrics such as click-through and conversion rates by training on sampled preference vectors. A significant advantage is that after training, a single model can access the entire Pareto front, allowing it to be tailored to meet the specific requirements of different stakeholders by adjusting an additional input vector that weights the objectives. We validate the model's performance through extensive offline and online evaluation. For broader application and research, the source code is made available at https://github.com/otto-de/MultiTRON . The results confirm the model's ability to manage multiple recommendation objectives effectively, offering a flexible tool for diverse business needs.</description>

      <title>A Standardized Machine-readable Dataset Documentation Format for Responsible AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data is critical to advancing AI technologies, yet its quality and documentation remain significant challenges, leading to adverse downstream effects (e.g., potential biases) in AI applications. This paper addresses these issues by introducing Croissant-RAI, a machine-readable metadata format designed to enhance the discoverability, interoperability, and trustworthiness of AI datasets. Croissant-RAI extends the Croissant metadata format and builds upon existing responsible AI (RAI) documentation frameworks, offering a standardized set of attributes and practices to facilitate community-wide adoption. Leveraging established web-publishing practices, such as Schema.org, Croissant-RAI enables dataset users to easily find and utilize RAI metadata regardless of the platform on which the datasets are published. Furthermore, it is seamlessly integrated into major data search engines, repositories, and machine learning frameworks, streamlining the reading and writing of responsible AI metadata within practitioners' existing workflows. Croissant-RAI was developed through a community-led effort. It has been designed to be adaptable to evolving documentation requirements and is supported by a Python library and a visual editor.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Prompt Personalization for Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing effective prompts can empower LLMs to understand user preferences and provide recommendations by leveraging LLMs' intent comprehension and knowledge utilization capabilities. However, existing research predominantly concentrates on task-wise prompting, developing fixed prompt templates composed of four patterns (i.e., role-playing, history records, reasoning guidance, and output format) and applying them to all users for a given task. Although convenient, task-wise prompting overlooks individual user differences, leading to potential mismatches in capturing user preferences. To address it, we introduce the concept of instance-wise prompting to personalize discrete prompts for individual users and propose Reinforced Prompt Personalization (RPP) to optimize the four patterns in prompts using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). To boost efficiency, RPP formulates prompt personalization as selecting optimal sentences holistically across the four patterns, rather than optimizing word-by-word. To ensure the quality of prompts, RPP meticulously crafts diverse expressions for each of the four patterns, considering multiple analytical perspectives for specific recommendation tasks. In addition to RPP, our proposal of RPP+ aims to enhance the scalability of action space by dynamically refining actions with LLMs throughout the iterative process. We evaluate the effectiveness of RPP/RPP+ in ranking tasks over various datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RPP/RPP+ over traditional recommender models, few-shot methods, and other prompt-based methods, underscoring the significance of instance-wise prompting for LLMs in recommendation tasks and validating the effectiveness of RPP/RPP+. Our code is available at https://github.com/maowenyu-11/RPP.</description>

      <title>Intent-Guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL)-based recommender systems have gained prominence in the context of Heterogeneous Graph (HG) due to their capacity to enhance the consistency of representations across different views. Nonetheless, existing frameworks often neglect the fact that user-item interactions within HG are governed by diverse latent intents (for instance, preferences towards specific brands or the demographic characteristics of item audiences), which are pivotal in capturing fine-grained relations. The exploration of these underlying intents, particularly through the lens of meta-paths in HGs, presents us with two principal challenges: i) How to integrate CL mechanisms with latent intents; ii) How to mitigate the noise associated with these complicated intents.To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework termed Intent-Guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (IHGCL), which designed to enhance CL-based recommendation by capturing the intents contained within meta-paths. Specifically, the IHGCL framework includes: i) it employs a meta-path-based dual contrastive learning approach to effectively integrate intents into the recommendation, constructing meta-path contrast and view contrast; ii) it uses an bottlenecked autoencoder that combines mask propagation with the information bottleneck principle to significantly reduce noise perturbations introduced by meta-paths. Empirical evaluations conducted across six distinct datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our IHGCL framework relative to conventional baseline methods. Our model implementation is available at https://github.com/wangyu0627/IHGCL.</description>

      <title>Covering a Graph with Dense Subgraph Families, via Triangle-Rich Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure used to represent relationships in domains as diverse as the social sciences, bioinformatics, cybersecurity, the Internet, and more. One of the central observations in network science is that real-world graphs are globally sparse, yet contains numerous "pockets" of high edge density. A fundamental task in graph mining is to discover these dense subgraphs. Most common formulations of the problem involve finding a single (or a few) "optimally" dense subsets. But in most real applications, one does not care for the optimality. Instead, we want to find a large collection of dense subsets that covers a significant fraction of the input graph.
  We give a mathematical formulation of this problem, using a new definition of regularly triangle-rich (RTR) families. These families capture the notion of dense subgraphs that contain many triangles and have degrees comparable to the subgraph size. We design a provable algorithm, RTRExtractor, that can discover RTR families that approximately cover any RTR set. The algorithm is efficient and is inspired by recent results that use triangle counts for community testing and clustering.
  We show that RTRExtractor has excellent behavior on a large variety of real-world datasets. It is able to process graphs with hundreds of millions of edges within minutes. Across many datasets, RTRExtractor achieves high coverage using high edge density datasets. For example, the output covers a quarter of the vertices with subgraphs of edge density more than (say) $0.5$, for datasets with 10M+ edges. We show an example of how the output of RTRExtractor correlates with meaningful sets of similar vertices in a citation network, demonstrating the utility of RTRExtractor for unsupervised graph discovery tasks.</description>

      <title>scGHSOM: Hierarchical clustering and visualization of single-cell and CRISPR data using growing hierarchical SOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional single-cell data poses significant challenges in identifying underlying biological patterns due to the complexity and heterogeneity of cellular states. We propose a comprehensive gene-cell dependency visualization via unsupervised clustering, Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GHSOM), specifically designed for analyzing high-dimensional single-cell data like single-cell sequencing and CRISPR screens. GHSOM is applied to cluster samples in a hierarchical structure such that the self-growth structure of clusters satisfies the required variations between and within. We propose a novel Significant Attributes Identification Algorithm to identify features that distinguish clusters. This algorithm pinpoints attributes with minimal variation within a cluster but substantial variation between clusters. These key attributes can then be used for targeted data retrieval and downstream analysis. Furthermore, we present two innovative visualization tools: Cluster Feature Map and Cluster Distribution Map. The Cluster Feature Map highlights the distribution of specific features across the hierarchical structure of GHSOM clusters. This allows for rapid visual assessment of cluster uniqueness based on chosen features. The Cluster Distribution Map depicts leaf clusters as circles on the GHSOM grid, with circle size reflecting cluster data size and color customizable to visualize features like cell type or other attributes. We apply our analysis to three single-cell datasets and one CRISPR dataset (cell-gene database) and evaluate clustering methods with internal and external CH and ARI scores. GHSOM performs well, being the best performer in internal evaluation (CH=4.2). In external evaluation, GHSOM has the third-best performance of all methods.</description>

      <title>A Novel Two-Step Fine-Tuning Pipeline for Cold-Start Active Learning in Text Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first work to investigate the effectiveness of BERT-based contextual embeddings in active learning (AL) tasks on cold-start scenarios, where traditional fine-tuning is infeasible due to the absence of labeled data. Our primary contribution is the proposal of a more robust fine-tuning pipeline - DoTCAL - that diminishes the reliance on labeled data in AL using two steps: (1) fully leveraging unlabeled data through domain adaptation of the embeddings via masked language modeling and (2) further adjusting model weights using labeled data selected by AL. Our evaluation contrasts BERT-based embeddings with other prevalent text representation paradigms, including Bag of Words (BoW), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and FastText, at two critical stages of the AL process: instance selection and classification. Experiments conducted on eight ATC benchmarks with varying AL budgets (number of labeled instances) and number of instances (about 5,000 to 300,000) demonstrate DoTCAL's superior effectiveness, achieving up to a 33% improvement in Macro-F1 while reducing labeling efforts by half compared to the traditional one-step method. We also found that in several tasks, BoW and LSI (due to information aggregation) produce results superior (up to 59% ) to BERT, especially in low-budget scenarios and hard-to-classify tasks, which is quite surprising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized social media platforms like Bluesky Social (Bluesky) have made it possible to publicly disclose some user behaviors with millisecond-level precision. Embracing Bluesky's principles of open-source and open-data, we present the first collection of the temporal dynamics of user-driven social interactions. BlueTempNet integrates multiple types of networks into a single multi-network, including user-to-user interactions (following and blocking users) and user-to-community interactions (creating and joining communities). Communities are user-formed groups in custom Feeds, where users subscribe to posts aligned with their interests. Following Bluesky's public data policy, we collect existing Bluesky Feeds, including the users who liked and generated these Feeds, and provide tools to gather users' social interactions within a date range. This data-collection strategy captures past user behaviors and supports the future data collection of user behavior.</description>

Abstract: The growing use of social media has led to drastic changes in our decision-making. Especially, Facebook offers marketing API which promotes business to target potential groups who are likely to consume their items. However, this service can be abused by malicious advertisers who attempt to deceive people by disinformation such as propaganda and divisive opinion. To counter this problem, we introduce a new application named FBAdTracker. The purpose of this application is to provide an integrated data collection and analysis system for current research on fact-checking related to Facebook advertisements. Our system is capable of monitoring up-to-date Facebook ads and analyzing ads retrieved from Facebook Ads Library.</description>

      <title>Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and items providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raise the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve items' side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) fairnessaware attention which incorporates dot product in the normalization process of GNNs, to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees, and ii) heterophily feature weighting to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates the unfairness and popularity bias on items' side, but also achieves superior accuracy on users' side. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/NematGH/HetroFair.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Enhanced Collaborative Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted considerable interest among researchers to leverage these models to enhance Recommender Systems (RSs). Existing work predominantly utilizes LLMs to generate knowledge-rich texts or utilizes LLM-derived embeddings as features to improve RSs. Although the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs generally benefits RSs, the application can only take limited number of users and items as inputs, without adequately exploiting collaborative filtering information. Considering its crucial role in RSs, one key challenge in enhancing RSs with LLMs lies in providing better collaborative filtering information through LLMs. In this paper, drawing inspiration from the in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning in LLMs, we propose the Large Language Models enhanced Collaborative Filtering (LLM-CF) framework, which distils the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into collaborative filtering. We also explored a concise and efficient instruction-tuning method, which improves the recommendation capabilities of LLMs while preserving their general functionalities (e.g., not decreasing on the LLM benchmark). Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-CF significantly enhances several backbone recommendation models and consistently outperforms competitive baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in distilling the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM into collaborative filtering.</description>

      <title>CADC: Encoding User-Item Interactions for Compressing Recommendation Model Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) are at the heart of the current e-commerce industry. However, the amount of training data used to train these large models is growing exponentially, leading to substantial training hurdles. The training dataset contains two primary types of information: content-based information (features of users and items) and collaborative information (interactions between users and items). One approach to reduce the training dataset is to remove user-item interactions. But that significantly diminishes collaborative information, which is crucial for maintaining accuracy due to its inclusion of interaction histories. This loss profoundly impacts DLRM performance.
  This paper makes an important observation that if one can capture the user-item interaction history to enrich the user and item embeddings, then the interaction history can be compressed without losing model accuracy. Thus, this work, Collaborative Aware Data Compression (CADC), takes a two-step approach to training dataset compression. In the first step, we use matrix factorization of the user-item interaction matrix to create a novel embedding representation for both the users and items. Once the user and item embeddings are enriched by the interaction history information the approach then applies uniform random sampling of the training dataset to drastically reduce the training dataset size while minimizing model accuracy drop. The source code of CADC is available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DSS-RM-8C1D/README.md}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DSS-RM-8C1D/README.md}.</description>

      <title>Pacer and Runner: Cooperative Learning Framework between Single- and Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) improves recommendation performance by utilizing information from multiple domains, which contrasts with Single-Domain Sequential Recommendation (SDSR) that relies on a historical interaction within a specific domain. However, CDSR may underperform compared to the SDSR approach in certain domains due to negative transfer, which occurs when there is a lack of relation between domains or different levels of data sparsity. To address the issue of negative transfer, our proposed CDSR model estimates the degree of negative transfer of each domain and adaptively assigns it as a weight factor to the prediction loss, to control gradient flows through domains with significant negative transfer. To this end, our model compares the performance of a model trained on multiple domains (CDSR) with a model trained solely on the specific domain (SDSR) to evaluate the negative transfer of each domain using our asymmetric cooperative network. In addition, to facilitate the transfer of valuable cues between the SDSR and CDSR tasks, we developed an auxiliary loss that maximizes the mutual information between the representation pairs from both tasks on a per-domain basis. This cooperative learning between SDSR and CDSR tasks is similar to the collaborative dynamics between pacers and runners in a marathon. Our model outperformed numerous previous works in extensive experiments on two real-world industrial datasets across ten service domains. We also have deployed our model in the recommendation system of our personal assistant app service, resulting in 21.4% increase in click-through rate compared to existing models, which is valuable to real-world business.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12517v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying texts with a given semantics is central for many information seeking scenarios. Similarity search over vector embeddings appear to be central to this ability, yet the similarity reflected in current text embeddings is corpus-driven, and is inconsistent and sub-optimal for many use cases. What, then, is a good notion of similarity for effective retrieval of text?
  We identify the need to search for texts based on abstract descriptions of their content, and the corresponding notion of \emph{description based similarity}. We demonstrate the inadequacy of current text embeddings and propose an alternative model that significantly improves when used in standard nearest neighbor search. The model is trained using positive and negative pairs sourced through prompting a LLM, demonstrating how data from LLMs can be used for creating new capabilities not immediately possible using the original model.</description>

Abstract: The robustness of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly important as their use rapidly grows in a wide range of domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is considered as a means to improve the trustworthiness of text generation from LLMs. However, how the outputs from RAG-based LLMs are affected by slightly different inputs is not well studied. In this work, we find that the insertion of even a short prefix to the prompt leads to the generation of outputs far away from factually correct answers. We systematically evaluate the effect of such prefixes on RAG by introducing a novel optimization technique called Gradient Guided Prompt Perturbation (GGPP). GGPP achieves a high success rate in steering outputs of RAG-based LLMs to targeted wrong answers. It can also cope with instructions in the prompts requesting to ignore irrelevant context. We also exploit LLMs' neuron activation difference between prompts with and without GGPP perturbations to give a method that improves the robustness of RAG-based LLMs through a highly effective detector trained on neuron activation triggered by GGPP generated prompts. Our evaluation on open-sourced LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Unravelling Local Government Data Sharing Barriers in Estonia and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open Government Data (OGD) plays a crucial role in transforming smart cities into sustainable and intelligent entities by providing data for analytics, real-time monitoring, and informed decision-making. This data is increasingly used in urban digital twins, enhancing city management through stakeholder collaboration. However, local administrative data remains underutilized even in digitally advanced countries like Estonia. This study explores barriers preventing Estonian municipalities from sharing OGD, using a qualitative approach through interviews with Estonian municipalities and drawing on the OGD-adapted Innovation Resistance Theory model (IRT). Interviews with local government officials highlight ongoing is-sues in data provision and quality. By addressing overlooked weaknesses in the Estonian open data ecosystem and providing actionable recommendations, this research contributes to a more resilient and sustainable open data ecosystem. Additionally, by validating the OGD-adapted Innovation Resistance Theory model and proposing a revised version tailored for local government contexts, the study advances theoretical frameworks for understanding data sharing resistance. Ultimately, this study serves as a call to action for policymakers and practitioners to prioritize local OGD initiatives, ensuring the full utilization of OGD in smart city development.</description>

      <title>Empirical analysis of Binding Precedent efficiency in the Brazilian Supreme Court via Similar Case Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binding precedents (S\'umulas Vinculantes) constitute a juridical instrument unique to the Brazilian legal system and whose objectives include the protection of the Federal Supreme Court against repetitive demands. Studies of the effectiveness of these instruments in decreasing the Court's exposure to similar cases, however, indicate that they tend to fail in such a direction, with some of the binding precedents seemingly creating new demands. We empirically assess the legal impact of five binding precedents, 11, 14, 17, 26 and 37, at the highest court level through their effects on the legal subjects they address. This analysis is only possible through the comparison of the Court's ruling about the precedents' themes before they are created, which means that these decisions should be detected through techniques of Similar Case Retrieval. The contributions of this article are therefore twofold: on the mathematical side, we compare the uses of different methods of Natural Language Processing -- TF-IDF, LSTM, BERT, and regex -- for Similar Case Retrieval, whereas on the legal side, we contrast the inefficiency of these binding precedents with a set of hypotheses that may justify their repeated usage. We observe that the deep learning models performed significantly worse in the specific Similar Case Retrieval task and that the reasons for binding precedents to fail in responding to repetitive demand are heterogeneous and case-dependent, making it impossible to single out a specific cause.</description>

      <title>Inter and Intra Prior Learning-based Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction Using Snapshot SWIR Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shortwave-infrared(SWIR) spectral information, ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 2.5{\mu}m, overcomes the limitations of traditional color cameras in acquiring scene information. However, conventional SWIR hyperspectral imaging systems face challenges due to their bulky setups and low acquisition speeds. This work introduces a snapshot SWIR hyperspectral imaging system based on a metasurface filter and a corresponding filter selection method to achieve the lowest correlation coefficient among these filters. This system offers the advantages of compact size and snapshot imaging. We propose a novel inter and intra prior learning unfolding framework to achieve high-quality SWIR hyperspectral image reconstruction, which bridges the gap between prior learning and cross-stage information interaction. Additionally, We design an adaptive feature transfer mechanism to adaptively transfer the contextual correlation of multi-scale encoder features to prevent detailed information loss in the decoder. Experiment results demonstrate that our method can reconstruct hyperspectral images with high speed and superior performance over existing methods.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Guided Response for Security Operation Centers with Microsoft Copilot for Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security operation centers contend with a constant stream of security incidents, ranging from straightforward to highly complex. To address this, we developed Copilot Guided Response (CGR), an industry-scale ML architecture that guides security analysts across three key tasks -- (1) investigation, providing essential historical context by identifying similar incidents; (2) triaging to ascertain the nature of the incident -- whether it is a true positive, false positive, or benign positive; and (3) remediation, recommending tailored containment actions. CGR is integrated into the Microsoft Defender XDR product and deployed worldwide, generating millions of recommendations across thousands of customers. Our extensive evaluation, incorporating internal evaluation, collaboration with security experts, and customer feedback, demonstrates that CGR delivers high-quality recommendations across all three tasks. We provide a comprehensive overview of the CGR architecture, setting a precedent as the first cybersecurity company to openly discuss these capabilities in such depth. Additionally, we GUIDE, the largest public collection of real-world security incidents, spanning 13M evidences across 1M annotated incidents. By enabling researchers and practitioners to conduct research on real-world data, GUIDE advances the state of cybersecurity and supports the development of next-generation machine learning systems.</description>
