      <title>Regge trajectories, detectors, and distributions in the critical ${\rm O}(N)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore light-ray operators in the critical O$(N)$ model in the large-$N$ limit, focusing on leading-twist and leading ``horizontal" trajectories. We distinguish between light-ray operators in two conformal frames: detector operators, which characterize event shapes of final states, and distribution operators, which probe initial-state distributions. In particular, we identify parton distribution functions (PDFs) and collinear functions as matrix elements of appropriate distribution operators. We renormalize some simple detector operators at leading order in $1/N$, allowing us to extract the Regge intercept and the anomalous spin of the leading horizontal trajectory. We furthermore renormalize distribution versions of these operators, obtaining the leading-twist splitting function and a BFKL-type kernel, which match results from the detector frame. Finally, we show how these results can be read off from OPE data encoded in the Bethe-Salpeter resummation of conformal four-point functions.</description>

      <title>The analytic bootstrap at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new universal formulae for thermal two-point functions of scalar operators based on their analytic structure, constructed to manifestly satisfy all the bootstrap conditions. We derive a dispersion relation in the complexified time plane, which fixes the correlator up to an additive constant and theory-dependent dynamical information. At non-zero spatial separation we introduce a formula for the thermal two-point function obtained by summing over images of the dispersion relation result obtained in the OPE regime. This construction satisfies all thermal bootstrap conditions, with the exception of clustering at infinite distance, which must be verified on a case-by-case basis. We test our results both in weakly and strongly-coupled theories. In particular, we show that the asymptotic behavior for the heavy sector proposed in~\cite{Marchetto:2023xap} and its correction can be explicitly derived from the dispersion relation. We combine analytical and numerical results to compute the thermal two-point function of the energy operator in the $3d$ Ising model and find agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>A holographic connection between strings and causal diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore ideas of holography and strings living in the $d+1$ dimensional Anti-de Sitter space $AdS_{d+1}$ in a unified framework borrowed from twistor theory. In our treatise of correspondences between geometric structures of the bulk $AdS_{d+1}$, its boundary and the moduli space of boundary causal diamonds aka the kinematic space ${\mathbb K}$, we adopt a perspective offered by projective geometry. From this viewpoint certain lines in the $d+1$ dimensional real projective space, defined by two light-like vectors in ${\mathbb R}^{d,2}$ play an important role. In these projective geometric elaborations objects like Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces, spacelike geodesics with horospheres providing regularizators for them and the metric on ${\mathbb K}$ all find a natural place. Then we establish a connection between classical strings in $AdS_{d+1}$ and the causal diamonds of its asymptotic boundary. We also study how the string equations of motion result in a dynamics of the boundary causal diamonds. A procedure for lifting up a causal diamond to get a proper string world sheet is developed. In this context we identify an emerging $SO(1,1)\times SO(1,d-1)$ gauge structure incorporated into a Grassmannian $\sigma$-model targeted in ${\mathbb K}$. The $d=2$ case is worked out in detail. Surprisingly in this case AdS$_3$ with its strings seems to be a natural object which is living inside projective twistor space. On the other hand ${\mathbb K}$ (comprising two copies of two dimensional de Sitter spaces) is a one which is living inside the Klein quadric, as a real section of a complexified space time.</description>

      <title>Seeing through the confinement screen: DGLAP/BFKL mixing and light-ray matching in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that collider observables such as hadron number flux can be matched onto a linear combination of detectors/light-ray operators in perturbative QCD. The spectrum of detectors in QCD is subtle, due to recombination between the DGLAP and BFKL trajectories. We explain how to define and renormalize these trajectories at one-loop, systematically incorporating their recombination. The leading and subleading soft gluon theorems play an important role, and our analysis suggests the presence of an infinite series of further subleading soft theorems for squared-amplitudes/form factors. Combined with our light-ray matching hypothesis, the anomalous dimensions of recombined DGLAP/BFKL detectors yield a prediction for the energy dependence of the number of particles in a jet, as well as other predictions for more general energy-weighted hadron measurements. We compare these predictions to Monte-Carlo simulations, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>On mixed 't Hooft anomalies of emergent symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamical constraints imposed on the UV theory when it develops an emergent symmetry in the infrared with mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions, the UV theory must contain non-genuine operators. Our primary examples illustrating this phenomenon are 2D gauged linear sigma models and 3D Chern-Simons-matter theories. Through this analysis, we establish connections between different classes of topological quantum field theories and propose a correspondence between quantum cohomologies of distinct target spaces.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of dyonic black holes in non-linear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dyonic black holes in a weak field expansion of non-linear electrodynamics. The breadth of parameter space permits a rich thermodynamic structure, additional turning points and intricate phase phenomena. Energy conditions are employed to ensure the physical viability of solutions. Analytic special cases illustrate novel properties of black holes in non-linear electrodynamics, including modified extremal limit behaviour. Numerical solutions offer the most elaborate thermodynamic landscape, culminating in up to five turning points, and multiple reentrant phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Angular $k$-uniformity and the Hyperinvariance of Holographic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic quantum error-correcting codes, often realized through tensor network architectures, have emerged as compelling toy models for exploring bulk-boundary duality in AdS-CFT. By encoding bulk information into highly entangled boundary degrees of freedom, they capture key features of holography such as subregion duality, operator reconstruction, and complementary recovery. Among them, hyperinvariant tensor networks-characterized by the inclusion of edge tensors and the enforcement of multi-tensor isometries-offer a promising platform for realizing features such as state dependence and nontrivial boundary correlations. However, existing constructions are largely confined to two-dimensional regular tilings, and the structural principles underlying hyperinvariance remain poorly understood, especially in higher dimensions. To address this, we introduce a geometric criterion called angular k-uniformity, which refines standard k-uniformity and its planar variants by requiring isometric behavior within angular sectors of a tensor's rotationally symmetric layout. This condition enables the systematic identification and construction of hyperinvariant holographic codes on regular hyperbolic honeycombs in arbitrary dimension, and extends naturally to heterogeneous networks and qLEGO architectures beyond regular tilings. Altogether, angular k-uniformity provides a versatile, geometry-aware framework for analyzing and designing holographic tensor networks and codes with hyperinvariant features such as nontrivial boundary correlations and state-dependent complementary recovery.</description>

      <title>Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.</description>

      <title>Duality-symmetric D3-brane action with twisted self-dual 2-form doublet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we apply the Sen formulation, which is originally developed for chiral form fields, to construct non-linear duality-symmetric actions in four dimensions. In particular, the duality-symmetric D3-brane action coupled to the type IIB supergravity background is constructed in the Sen formulation. Key features of the Sen formulation are also present in the duality-symmetric actions. For example, there are unphysical fields with the wrong sign of kinetic terms. These fields are uncoupled from physical fields at the equations of motion level. We show that the constructed duality-symmetric D3-brane action has symmetries such as diffeomorphism, supergauge symmetry, and kappa symmetry. The action also gives required equations of motion. Hamiltonian analysis is also studied. The decoupling between physical and unphysical sectors are also shown at the Hamiltonian level.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Branch and Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-point functions of non-BPS single-trace operators on the Coulomb branch of planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Holography relates them to overlaps between on-shell closed string states and a boundary state describing a probe D3-brane in $AdS_5\times S^{5}$. Assuming that the D-brane preserves integrability, we formulate and solve integrable bootstrap equations satisfied by the boundary state at finite 't Hooft coupling. This leads to a closed-form determinant expression for one-point functions at finite coupling, valid for sufficiently long operators. We test the result against direct field theory computations at tree level and one loop, finding perfect agreement.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Computational Perspective on Spread Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a direct connection between spread complexity and quantum circuit complexity by demonstrating that spread complexity emerges as a limiting case of a circuit complexity framework built from two fundamental operations: time-evolution and superposition. Our approach leverages a computational setup where unitary gates and beam-splitting operations generate target states, with the minimal cost of synthesis yielding a complexity measure that converges to spread complexity in the infinitesimal time-evolution limit. This perspective not only provides a physical interpretation of spread complexity but also offers computational advantages, particularly in scenarios where traditional methods like the Lanczos algorithm fail. We illustrate our framework with an explicit SU(2) example and discuss broader applications, including cases where return amplitudes are non-perturbative or divergent</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the character partition function of gravitons in the Nariai geometry using quasinormal modes. Employing the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev (DHS) prescription, we compute the bulk partition function from the spectrum of quasinormal frequencies. We demonstrate that the quasinormal partition function agrees with the bulk one-loop determinant of gravitons on $S^2 \times S^2$, as obtained via the heat kernel method. Furthermore, we isolate the contribution of the edge character from the full one-loop partition function on $S^2 \times S^2$, and provide remarks on the possible origin of this edge contribution in the quasinormal mode framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a two-dimensional dual field theory induced at the boundary of three-dimensional Chern-Simons gravity invariant under the Maxwell algebra. The resulting action takes the form of a Maxwellian extension of the flat Liouville theory known from the analysis of asymptotically flat three-dimensional gravity. This boundary theory is derived by reducing the bulk gravitational action to a Maxwell-invariant chiral Wess-Zumino-Witten model and imposing boundary conditions compatible with asymptotically flat geometries. Alternatively, we obtain the same theory as the geometric action on coadjoint orbits of the Maxwell extension of the BMS$_3$ group. Finally, we show how the boundary actions corresponding to both Poincar\'e and Maxwell invariance emerge from a Carrollian expansion of the boundary theory dual to AdS$_3$ Chern-Simons gravity.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping form factor squared in ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a bootstrap program for the {\it form factor squared} with operator ${\rm tr}(\phi^2)$ in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the planar limit, which plays a central role for perturbative calculations of important physical observables such as energy correlators. The tree-level $N$-point form factor (FF) squared can be obtained by cutting $N$ propagators of a collection of two-point ``master diagrams" at $(N{-}1)$ loops: for $N=3,4,5,6$ there are merely $1, 2, 4, 13$ topologies of such diagrams respectively, and their numerators are strongly constrained by power-counting (including ``no triangle" property) and other constraints such as the ``rung rule". Moreover, these two-point diagrams provide a ``unification" of FF squared at different numbers of loops and legs, which is similar to extracting (planar) amplitude squared from vacuum master diagrams (dual to $f$-graphs): by cutting $2\leq n&lt;N$ propagators, one can also extract the planar integrand of $n$-point FF squared at $(N-n)$ loops, thus our results automatically include integrands of 2-point (Sudakov) FF up to four loops (where the squaring is trivial), 3-point FF squared up to three loops, and so on. Our ansatz is completely fixed using soft limits of (tree and loop) FF squared and the multi-collinear limit which reduces it to the splitting function, without any other inputs such as unitarity cuts. This method opens up the exciting possibility of a {\it graphical bootstrap} for FF squared for higher $N$ (which contains {\it e.g.} planar Sudakov FF to $N{-}2$ loops) similar to that for the amplitude squared via $f$-graphs. We also comment on applications to the computation of leading order energy correlators where new structures are expected after performing phase-space integrations.</description>

      <title>Photon rings in a holographic toy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light circling around an astrophysical black hole can spend a long time skirting its unstably bound photon orbits before escaping to infinity. To a distant observer, this orbiting light would appear as a bright ring encircling the image of the black hole. Though not yet resolved by radio-interferometric observations from the ground, this ``photon ring'' will be the target of future space-based black hole observations. Motivated by this experimental prospect, studies have sought to elucidate the theoretical connections between the photon ring -- an observable, classical effect -- and the putative holographic description of black holes in quantum gravity. General relativity predicts that the detailed structure of the photon ring encodes the high-frequency (eikonal) spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs) emitted by a perturbed black hole as it rings down, and also that the photon ring displays an emergent conformal symmetry that acts upon this spectrum. In holography, the classical QNM frequencies are expected to map to Ruelle resonances of the dual quantum theory. In this paper, we explore these connections in a lower-dimensional toy model based on Warped AdS$_3$ black holes that shares many features with the (3+1)-dimensional Kerr background -- including a photon ring at finite radius -- while still providing analytic control of the QNM frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) data from observed binary black hole coalescences (BBHC), proven to validate the Hawking Area Theorem (HAT) for black hole horizons, has been demonstrated to unambiguously pick theoretically computed logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Formula, which have a {\it negative} coefficient, when combined with the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics. We propose a composite, `hybrid' approach to quantum gravity black hole entropy calculation, additively combining results from the non-peturbative, background-independent Loop Quantum Gravity method, with those from the perturbative (one loop), background-dependent semiclassical approach (often called `geometric' entropy) based on Euclidean Quantum Gravity. Our goal is to examine under what conditions, {\it absolute} consistency with HAT-validating GW data analyses is guaranteed. As a consequence of this demand for absolute consistency, nontrivial, albeit indirect, constraints appear to emerge on the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) part of the spectrum of perturbative elementary particle fluctuations in a classical black hole background. Some species of the constrained, yet-unobserved BSM particle spectrum are currently under active consideration in particle cosmology as candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in production of scalaron dark matter in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the scalaron, a scalar degree of freedom, emerging from the $f(R)$ theory of gravity, can account for the observed dark matter (DM) abundance if its mass is around the MeV scale, to ensure its cosmological stability. Focusing on two well-known $f(R)$ gravity models, we systematically show that if scalaron production proceeds via the freeze-in mechanism, the right relic abundance is satisfied over a very narrow window of reheating temperature $10^{14}\lesssim T_{\rm rh}\lesssim 10^{16}$ GeV. We delineate the viable parameter space of the $f(R)$ models consistent with the observed DM abundance, and highlight relevant experimental constraints from searches targeting DM decay signatures.</description>

      <title>Black-hole hair from vector dark matter accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model a single black hole in equilibrium with a dark photon-cold dark matter environment. Representing the dark photon as a Proca field, we show that a Schwarzschild black hole grows vector-field "hair" when allowed to accrete from an infinite homogeneous bath of particles far from the horizon. We solve the Proca equation in linear perturbation theory, separating it using the vector spherical harmonics and Frolov-Krtou\v{s}-Kubiz\v{n}\'{a}k-Santos approaches for the odd-parity and even-parity sectors, respectively. In the "particle" dark matter regime, the field is purely infalling and exhibits a sharply peaked density profile, in concordance with the particle dark matter "spikes" studied in the literature. In the "wave" regime, the field exhibits standing waves, and the profile is smeared. We find a dark-matter density amplification upward of $10^7$ near the horizon. Though small for most black holes, we find the mass enclosed in the cloud can reach $\sim 1 \%$ of the black hole mass for large supermassive black holes. These black holes are also most susceptible to vector dark matter accretion, with mass accretion rates as large as $10 M_\odot/$yr.</description>

      <title>Emergent Viscous Hydrodynamics From a Single Quantum Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in quantum systems with few degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>The de Sitter Weak Gravity Conjecture from 3-Form Black Holes and Inflation with Higher-Derivative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between the de Sitter (dS) Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and slow-roll inflation within a framework governed by a 3-form gauge field. Starting from classical considerations, we derive an upper bound on the mass of extremal charged black holes in dS spacetime which constrains the admissible parameter space. To incorporate quantum gravity effects, we introduce higher-derivative corrections to the 3-form action and obtain additional bounds on these terms, ensuring consistency with swampland criteria. We further analyze these corrections from a thermodynamic perspective, confirming that the Wald entropy remains compatible with the classical extremality bound. Extending this setup to cosmological inflation, we examine the scalar dual of the 3-form in both large-field and small-field regimes. In the large-field limit, the potential acquires a Higgs-like structure that supports slow-roll inflation. In contrast, the small-field limit leads to an effective potential with an AdS minimum, rendering it inconsistent with the dS swampland constraints. Notably, we find that the dS WGC can impose constraints more stringent than those derived from inflationary dynamics alone. These results underscore the utility of swampland-inspired principles in shaping viable models of early universe cosmology.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture by Starr and log-concavity for random commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture by Shannon Starr regarding the asymptotics for the number of tuples of commuting permutations with given number of joint orbits. These numbers generalize unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind which count how many single permutations have a given number of cycles. In the case of pairs of permutations, these numbers are related to D'Arcais polynomials and the Nekrasov-Okounkov formula. As a consequence of the above asymptotics, we confirm a log-concavity conjecture in the regime of typical values for the number of joint orbits. As a result of possible indepentent interest in applied mathematics and mathematical physics, we also provide detailed asymptotics, using Mellin transform techniques, for certain multiple series or multivariate Ramanujan sums which are related to ordinary generating functions of Dirichlet convolutions of power laws. Besides these multiple sums asymptotics, our proofs use bivariate saddle point analysis related to the Meinardus theorem in the delicate case of multiple poles for the associated Dirichlet series.</description>

      <title>Quantum cosmological perturbations in bouncing models with mimetic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations originated from quantum vacuum fluctuations in bouncing scenarios proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology} in the framework of mimetic cosmology. We show that all physically relevant models produce scale invariant spectral indices, and amplitudes compatible with observations provided that the bounce occurs at length scales $t_0$ inside the physically reasonable interval $10^5 l_p &lt; t_0 &lt; 10^9 l_p$. We also show that by slightly modifying the scalar field potential proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology}, we can also obtain the observed red-tilted spectral index, with the same amplitude constraints. Hence, mimetic cosmology provides reasonable bouncing cosmological models without the need of any background quantum effect.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between new agegraphic and Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in the context of $f(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the universe in the context of $f(T)$ gravity with flat-FRW background and consider it to be a combination of three components: baryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy. We consider the new agegraphic as an alternative for dark energy and the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) as an alternative for dark matter. After that, first we obtain the Friedman equations and then we obtain the continuity equations in the presence of the interaction term between the dark components of the universe, so that the interaction term is considered as the flow of energy from dark matter to dark energy. In what follows, we plot the variation of the cosmological parameters of dark energy in terms of the redshift parameter by using of the power-law cosmology. Finally, we investigate the evolution and stability of the universe and report the values of the density parameters of the universe components that confirm the present model with observational data.</description>

      <title>Dense matter in a holographic hard-wall model of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deeper understanding of QCD matter at strong coupling remains challenging due to its non-perturbative nature. To this end, we study a two-flavor holographic hard-wall model to investigate the properties of QCD at finite-density and zero temperature with a nonvanishing quark mass. A dense matter phase is described by a classical solution of the equations of motion in a homogeneous Ansatz. We apply holographic renormalization to formulate the holographic dictionary that relates UV boundary data in the bulk with the physical quantities in QCD. We emphasize a role played by an IR boundary action on the hard-wall when analyzing the QCD phase structures in this holographic setup. It is found that a baryonic matter phase is manifested in this model with a high baryon number density and a nearly vanishing chiral condensate. We derive the equation of state for the resulting phase and use it to work out the mass-radius relation for neutron stars. We find that the maximum mass of neutron stars can exceed two solar masses for a wide range of free parameters in this model. We also comment on an alternative scenario about the phase structure such that the baryonic matter phase arises at a baryon number chemical potential greater than a critical value.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Barriers: Kramers' Escape Rate Analysis of Metastable Dynamics in First-Order Multi-Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expanding application of classical thermodynamic methods to black hole physics has yielded significant advances in characterizing phase transition behavior. Among these approaches, thermodynamic analysis -- particularly kinetic formulations like the Kramers' escape rate -- provides a robust framework for probing black hole phase transitions with minimal relativistic constraints. This study investigates the kinetics and dynamic evolution of first-order phase transitions in black holes exhibiting multiple critical points, employing a particle-based escape rate model. The distinct free energy landscapes inherent to multi-critical systems, which can simultaneously support multiple local minima under specific thermodynamic conditions (temperature and pressure) within a given reference frame, raise fundamental questions regarding transition pathways. We rigorously assess whether the Kramers' escape rate retains its predictive validity in these complex multi-minima systems, as established for conventional single-minimum configurations. Furthermore, we examine whether transitions proceed via a sequential, stepwise mechanism between adjacent minima, or if pathways exist that bypass intermediate states through direct descent to the global minimum. Our analysis of black holes undergoing multiphase transitions reveals both parallels and significant deviations from single-transition models. Crucially, we demonstrate that the Kramers' escape rate remains a quantitatively reliable indicator of first-order phase transitions in black holes, even within multi-critical frameworks. This approach offers deeper insights into the governing energetic landscapes and kinetic processes underlying these phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the full symmetric Toda system is integrable in the sense of the Lie-Bianchi criterion, i.e. that there exists a solvable Lie algebra of vector fields of dimension $N=\dim M$ on the phase space $M$ of this system such that the system is invariant with respect to the action of these fields. The proof is based on the use of symmetries of the full symmetric system, which we described earlier in \cite{CSS23}, and the appearance of the structure of the stochastic Lie algebra in their description.</description>

      <title>A new exact rotating spacetime in vacuum: The Kerr--Levi-Civita Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new rotating solution of Einstein's theory in vacuum by exploiting the Lie point symmetries of the field equations in the complex potential formalism of Ernst. In particular, we perform a discrete symmetry transformation, known as inversion, of the gravitational potential associated with the Kerr metric. The resulting metric describes a rotating generalization of the Schwarzschild--Levi-Civita spacetime, and we refer to it as the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric. We study the key geometric features of this novel spacetime, which turns out to be free of curvature singularities, topological defects, and closed timelike curves. These attractive properties are also common to the extremal black hole and the super-spinning case. The solution is algebraically general (Petrov-type I), and its horizon structure is exactly that of the Kerr spacetime. The ergoregions, however, are strongly influenced by the Levi-Civita-like asymptotic structure, producing an effect akin to the magnetized Kerr--Newman and swirling solutions. Interestingly, while its static counterpart permits a Kerr--Schild representation, the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric does not admit such a formulation.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for the integrand-level reduction of two-loop helicity amplitudes in both $d=4-2\epsilon$ and $d=4$ dimensions. The amplitude is expressed in terms of a set of Feynman integrals and their coefficients that depend on the external kinematics. The analysis presented in this paper, in conjunction with the ongoing development of the computational framework $\text{HELAC-2LOOP}$, paves the road for the construction of an automated program for two-loop amplitude calculations for arbitrary scattering processes.</description>

Abstract: We compute explicitly the equations of motion of the Hamiltonian formulation of quadratic gravity. This is the theory with the most general Lagrangian with terms of quadratic order in the curvature tensor. We employ the symbolic computational tool Cadabra. We present the linearized version of the equations of motion, performing the longitudinal-transverse decomposition. We compare the linear equations with the covariant field equations, finding that, if general-relativity terms are active, the linear Hamiltonian formulation is valid only if the perturbative spatial metric is traceless, a condition that can be freely imposed by recurring to an arbitrary function. We apply the equations of motion on homogeneous and isotropic configurations, finding explicit solutions.</description>

      <title>Three-loop QCD Mass Relation between the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ and Symmetric-momentum Subtraction Scheme Away from the Chiral Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perturbative result for the quark-mass conversion factor between the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ and regularization-independent symmetric-momentum subtraction scheme (RI/SMOM) away from the chiral limit, i.e. at non-zero quark masses (RI/mSMOM), is derived up to three loops in QCD, extending the existing result by two additional orders. We further explore an illuminating possibility that in Dimensional Regularization, the original RI/(m)SMOM renormalization conditions may be interpreted merely in a weaker sense, namely as equations holding just in the 4-dimensional limit rather than exactly in $d$ dimensions: they work and result in different, albeit simpler, renormalization constants but still the same finite conversion factor. This novel observation has the added benefit of reducing computational effort, particularly at high orders. Furthermore we show that the two renormalization conditions considered for the scalar operator yield factors differing from the pseudoscalar case beyond one loop, but both converge to the latter in the chiral limit. Lastly, our result for the conversion factor exhibits rich behaviors, and in particular a window is observed in the subtraction scale and mass where it receives less perturbative corrections than the RI/SMOM counterpart up to three loops; this finding may help to further improve the accuracy of $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ quark-mass determinations with Lattice QCD.</description>

It considers three different types of local deformations in the vicinity of the event horizon, the negative static bump potential, the stochastic potential and bump potential modulated by time function in low frequency limit. Our numerical results show that infinitesimal local deformations on Regge-Wheeler potential near the horizon can overturn stability of an arbitrarily strongly stable black hole, implying that late-time behavior of a stable black hole is extremely sensitive to geometry near horizon. Specially, certain deformations that stabilize systems in flat backgrounds can destabilize otherwise stable black holes. It also shows that horizon-induced redshift transforms near-horizon quantum fluctuations into classical-scale stochastic deformations capable of triggering instability, implying that even an isolated black hole cannot keep stable in extended timescales.</description>

Abstract: This work explores how the generalized uncertainty principle, a theoretical modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle inspired by quantum gravity, affects neutrino flavor oscillations. By extending the standard two-flavor neutrino model, we show that the oscillation probability acquires an additional phase term that depends on the square roots of the neutrino masses, introducing new features beyond the conventional mass-squared differences. To account for the non-Hermitian nature of the resulting dynamics, we employ parity-time (PT) symmetric quantum mechanics, which allows for consistent descriptions of systems with balanced gain and loss. We analyze the feasibility of observing these effects in current and future neutrino experiments, such as DUNE, JUNO, IceCube, and KATRIN, and find that the predicted modifications could lie within experimental sensitivity. Moreover, we propose that analog quantum simulation platforms, such as cold atoms, trapped ions, and photonic systems, offer a promising route to test these predictions under controlled conditions. Our findings suggest that neutrino oscillations may serve as an effective probe of quantum gravity effects, providing a novel connection between fundamental theory and experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Thermal corrections to dark matter annihilation with real photon emission/absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter relic density is being increasingly precisely measured. This relic density is theoretically determined by a Boltzmann equation which computes the dark matter distribution according to the (thermally averaged) cross section for annihilation/production of dark matter within a given model. We present here the complete higher order thermal corrections, calculated using real time thermal field theory, to the cross section for the annihilation of dark matter into Standard Model fermions via charged scalars: $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f}$ and $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f} (\gamma)$. The latter process includes real photon emission into, and absorption from, the heat bath at temperature $T$. We use the Grammer and Yennie technique to separate the soft infra-red divergences, which greatly simplifies the calculation. We show explicitly the cancellation of both soft and collinear divergences between real and virtual contributions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the thermal field theory and remark on the non-trivial nature of the collinear divergences when the thermal contribution from fermions is considered. We present the leading thermal contributions to order ${\cal{O}}(\alpha T^2)$ for the case when the dark matter particle is a Majorana or Dirac type fermion. In the former case, both the leading order (LO) and NLO cross sections are helicity suppressed, while neither is suppressed in the Dirac case. It is interesting that the ratio of NLO to LO cross sections is the same for both Majorana and Dirac type dark matter.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries Phase Transitions with Local Quantum Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries are important guiding principle for phase transitions. We systematically construct field theory models with local quantum fields that exhibit the following phase transitions: (1) different symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with generalized symmetries; (2) different symmetry enriched topological (SET) phases with generalized symmetries differ by symmetry fractionalizations; (3) spontaneously broken generalized symmetries, where the unbroken phases can have nontrivial SPT or SET. The models are ordinary gauge theories with bosons or fermions in 3+1d and 2+1d. We focus on one-form symmetries and symmetries generated by condensation defects, which do not act on local operators. The phase transitions are protected from local operator perturbations which do not change the asymptotic phases. In particular, we show that continuous gauge theories in 3+1d can have different phases distinguished by fractionalizations of unbroken one-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Disentangling contributions to longitudinal magnetoconductivity for Kramers-Weyl nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set out to compute the longitudinal magnetoconductivity for an isolated and isotropic Kramers-Weyl node (KWN), existing in chiral crystals, which forms an exotic cousin of the conventional Weyl nodes resulting from band-inversions. The peculiarities of KWNs are many, the principal one being the presence of two concentric Fermi surfaces at any positive chemical potential ($\mu$) with respect to the nodal point. This is caused by a dominant quadratic-in-momentum dispersion, with the linear-in-momentum Dirac- or Weyl-like terms relegated to a secondary status. In a KWN, the chirally-conjugate node typically serves as a mere doppelg\"anger, being significantly separated in energy. Hence, when $\mu$ is set near such a node, the signatures of a lone node are probed in the transport-measurements. The intrinsic topological quantities in the forms of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment contribute to the linear response, which we determine by exactly solving the semiclassical Bolzmann equations. Another crucial feature is that the two bands at the same KWN node carry actual spin-quantum numbers, thus providing an additional coupling to an external magnetic field ($\boldsymbol B$), and affecting the conductivity. We take this into account as well, and demonstrate that it causes a linear-in-$B$ dependence, on top of the usual $B^2$-dependence.</description>

      <title>From 5d Flat Connections to 4d Fluxes (the Art of Slicing the Cone)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02313v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the Coulomb branch partition function of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ vector multiplet on closed simply-connected quasi-toric manifolds $B$. This includes a large class of theories, localising to either instantons or anti-instantons at the torus fixed points (including Donaldson-Witten and Pestun-like theories as examples). The main difficulty is to obtain flux contributions from the localisation procedure. We achieve this by taking a detour via the 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ vector multiplet on closed simply-connected toric Sasaki-manifolds $M$ which are principal $S^1$-bundles over $B$. The perturbative partition function can be expressed as a product over slices of the toric cone. By taking finite quotients $M/\mathbb{Z}_h$ along the $S^1$, the locus picks up non-trivial flat connections which, in the limit $h\to\infty$, provide the sought-after fluxes on $B$. We compute the one-loop partition functions around each topological sector on $M/\mathbb{Z}_h$ and $B$ explicitly, and then factorise them into contributions from the torus fixed points. This enables us to also write down the conjectured instanton part of the partition function on $B$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A concrete model of extracting the physics from the bulk of a gravitational universe is important to the study of quantum gravity and its possible relationship with experiments. Such a model can be constructed in the AdS/CFT correspondence by gluing a bath on the asymptotic boundary of the bulk anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. This bath models a laboratory and is described by a quantum field theory. In the dual conformal field theory (CFT) description this coupling is achieved by a double-trace deformation that couples the CFT with the bath. This suggests that the physics observed by the laboratory is fully unitary. In this paper, we analyze the quantum aspects of this model in detail which conveys new lessons about the AdS/CFT correspondence, and we discuss the potential usefulness of this model in understanding subregion physics in a gravitational universe.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>

      <title>Wedge Holographic Complexity in Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate holographic complexities in the context of wedge holography, focusing specifically on black string geometry in AdS$_3$. The wedge spacetime is bounded by two end-of-the-world (EOW) branes with intrinsic Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) gravity. In line with this codimension-two holography, there are three equivalent perspectives: bulk perspective, brane perspective, and boundary perspective. Using both the ''Complexity=Volume'' (CV) and ''Complexity=Action'' (CA) proposals, we analyze the complexity in wedge black string geometry in the tensionless limit. By treating the branes as rigid, we find the late-time growth rates of CV and CA match exactly across bulk and brane perspectives. These results are consistent with those from JT gravity, with additional contributions from the intrinsic gravity of the branes. For fluctuating branes, we find that the late-time growth rates of CV and CA match between bulk and brane perspectives at the linear order of fluctuation. The CV results exhibit $\frac{\phi_h^2}{\phi_0}$ corrections from fluctuations, consistent with the findings in previous work. Moreover, the CA results reveal an additional constant term in the fluctuating branes case. We provide an interpretation of this in terms of gravitational edge mode effects. The distinct corrections arising from fluctuations in the CA and CV proposals suggest that the CV proposal is more sensitive to geometric details. Furthermore, we discuss these results in relation to Lloyd's bound on complexity, their general time dependence, and the effects of fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We find a holographic reconstruction formula for gravitational Wilson line network operators in AdS$_2$ evaluated between Ishibashi states of the algebra $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$. It is given in integral form where the integrand is the global conformal block multiplied by a smearing function which is the product of the scalar bulk-to-boundary propagators. The integral can be explicitly calculated as multidimensional series of which arguments are rational functions of endpoint coordinates. In the case of two and three endpoints the resulting expressions allow one to establish a number of relations between the gravitational Wilson line networks and Witten diagrams for massive scalar fields in AdS$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in two-dimensional de Sitter space is an intriguing model for cosmological "wave functions of the universe". Its minisuperspace version already contains all physical information. The size of compact slices is parametrized by a scale factor $h &gt; 0$. The dilaton $\phi$ is chosen to have positive values, $\phi &gt; 0$, and interpreted as size of an additional compact slice in a higher-dimensional theory. At the boundaries $h=0$, $\phi=0$, where the volume of the universe vanishes, the curvature is generically singular. According to a conjecture by DeWitt, solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation should vanish at singular loci. Recently, the behaviour of JT wave functions at large field values $h$, $\phi$ has been obtained by means of a path integral over Schwarzian degrees of freedom of a boundary curve. We systematically analyze solutions of the WDW equation with Schwarzian asymptotic behaviour. We find real analytic solutions that vanish on the entire boundary, in agreement with DeWitt's conjecture. Projection to expanding and contracting branches may lead to singularities, which can however be avoided by an appropriate superposition of solutions. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of semiclassical wave functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Belinksy-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz dynamics of gravity close to a spacelike singularity can be mapped, at each point in space separately, onto the motion of a particle bouncing within half the fundamental domain of the modular group. We show that the semiclassical quantisation of this motion is a conformal quantum mechanics where the states are constrained to be modular invariant. Each such state defines an odd automorphic $L$-function. In particular, in a basis of dilatation eigenstates the wavefunction is proportional to the $L$-function along the critical axis and hence vanishes at the nontrivial zeros. We show that the $L$-function along the positive real axis is equal to the partition function of a gas of non-interacting charged oscillators labeled by prime numbers. This generalises Julia's notion of a primon gas. Each state therefore has a corresponding, dual, primon gas with a distinct nontrivial set of chemical potentials that ensure modular invariance. We extract universal features of these theories by averaging the logarithm of the partition function over the chemical potentials. The averaging produces the Witten index of a fermionic primon gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07995v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is bipartite entanglement sufficient for holography? Through the analysis of the Markov gap, it is known that the answer is no. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this issue from a different angle using a multi-entropy. We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} &lt; \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations and 2d (0,2) Quiver Gauge Theories beyond Toric Fano 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a family of birational transformations that relate toric Fano 3-folds defined by reflexive lattice polytopes can be identified with mass deformations of corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. These theories are realized by a Type IIA brane configuration known as brane brick models. We further show that the same family of birational transformations extends to more general toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, including those defined by non-reflexive toric diagrams. Under these birational transformations, the mesonic moduli spaces of the associated abelian 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories and brane brick models share the same number of generators and the same Hilbert series when refined only under the U(1)R symmetry. Since these transformations categorize toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds and their corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories into non-trivial equivalence classes, we anticipate that our findings will pave the way for a `Minimal Model Program' for quiver gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We consider the linearized perturbations of near-horizon extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in $d$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and seven-dimensional third-order Lovelock gravity. We find the solutions for the gravitational perturbations as a function of the higher-derivative coupling coefficients, which we treat nonperturbatively. Consequently, we observe a breakdown in perturbation theory for large harmonics for the six-derivative corrections.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the influence of a magnetic field on the running coupling constant for a heavy-quark model in a bottom-up holographic approach. To achieve this, we employ a magnetized Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton background that captures the essential features of heavy quark dynamics. Similar to the light-quark model, the running coupling $\alpha$ for heavy quarks decreases in the presence of a strong external magnetic field at fixed temperature and chemical potential. The key distinction between the light and heavy quark models lies in the locations of their respective phase transitions. However, near the 1st order phase transitions, the behavior of $\alpha$ is analogous for both cases: $\alpha$ exhibits jumps that depend on temperature, chemical potential, and magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>Gauge preservation in renormalization for Yang-Mills and gravity theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, multiplicative renormalization \cite{dixon} for Yang-Mills theories is reviewed. While this subject is not new, it is suggested that a clear understanding of these methods leads to a systematic way for interpreting the counter terms needed for non multiplicative renormalization of quantum gravity, for models such as \cite{dewitt}-\cite{stelle2}. These models are renormalizable but contain apparent instabilities leading to possible unitarity loss, an earlier analog is \cite{pais}. This systematic may be interesting, especially in the modern context, since there are efforts for avoiding with those apparent instabilities by employing variants of the standard quantization methods \cite{mannheim1}-\cite{salve}.</description>

      <title>Power Spectra in Double-Field Inflation Using Renormalization-Group Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A perturbative strategy for inflation described by two-inflaton fields is developed using a mathematical analogy with the renormalization-group. Two small quantities, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, corresponding to standard slow-roll parameters are defined and systematic expansions of all inflationary quantities in terms of powers of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are found. No other slow-roll parameters are needed. To illustrate this perturbative method in the multi-field context, we adopt a simple two-inflaton model with quadratic potentials in the parameter range where both fields contribute similarly to the dynamics of inflation. The model, even though it is not a viable alternative for phenomenological description of the inflationary period, nicely illustrates subtleties of the perturbative approach. In particular, this method allows us to derive two independent gauge-invariant scalar perturbations that are conserved in the superhorizon limit, overcoming typical problems that emerge in multi-field inflation. Furthermore, it is possible to perform nonperturbative resummations that allow to study the model in a true multi-field regime. We derive tensor and scalar power spectra to the next-to-next-to-leading and next-to-leading orders, respectively, as well as their spectral indices. The hierarchy between the two scalar perturbations allows us to single out the dominant entry of the scalar power-spectrum matrix. Modifications due to the second inflaton occur already at the leading order. Finally, we explain why the quadratic two-inflaton model is not compatible with the present experimental constraints even though non-trivial corrections to scalar perturbations do emerge.</description>

      <title>Holography and Causality in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been argued that the existence of a geodesic shortcut in the Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld rules out the possibility for a low-energy intermediate theory, even when gravity is turned off. We study this problem in an explicit example with two symmetrically placed KR branes. We find that there can be a consistent quantization of bulk matter fields with a holographic intermediate description. In our model, there is no causality violation. We use this example to study potential implications of the bulk geodesic shortcut. We find that there are possible enhancements of the correlation or entanglement between the two branes that is directly correlated with the extra-dimensional geometry. This could affect the low-energy regime when there are interactions between low and high energy modes. Our model makes it clear that any possible causality violation can only arise from the UV. Independently of the quantization, an intermediate description should be valid as an EFT.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate black hole evaporation from the path integral perspective. We demonstrate that besides the standard thermodynamic modes, there are non-thermodynamic modes of black hole evaporation which contain remnants. The pure thermodynamic process is recovered when the Gauss-Bonnet action is involved. This scenario opens a new window for analyzing the process of black-hole evaporation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oscillons are classical oscillatory solutions with very long but finite lifetimes in real scalar field theories with appropriate potentials. An interesting feature is that resonances appear in the lifetimes of the oscillon for the initial size of the oscillon core $R_0$, which was discovered by Honda and Choptuik in the case of Minkowski space. In a previous work, oscillons in the global anti-de Sitter (AdS) space have been constructed, which we abbreviate as AdS oscillons. We present new resonance structures for the curvature radius $L$ and the core size $R_0$ in the lifetime of the AdS oscillon. We then compute exponents associated with the resonance peaks. Finally, we observe the bifurcation of the peaks due to the reflected waves.</description>

Abstract: We study massive self-interacting vector field theories with mass added ``by hand".
  We show that the massless limit of the quartic self-interacting vector field theory is not smooth. Pathological behavior of the theory is not limited only at the classical level, even at the quantum level unitarity is violated at the two-loop. Using the Vainshtein mechanism, we show that it fails beyond the strong-coupling scale and hence a massless limit is not smooth even in quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the theory of massless fields of type II strings arising from the string field theory that uses two string fields, a physical one and an extra one that allows the writing of an action, but whose degrees of freedom ultimately decouple. The mechanism allowing the description of the self-dual five-form of type IIB, anticipated by Sen, is used by the SFT to describe all Ramond-Ramond forms in type IIB and IIA in a manifestly duality-invariant way. We find explicit expressions for the leading terms in the gauge transformation of the RR fields and focus on diffeomorphisms, which are exotic for both the physical and the extra fields, perhaps as needed to describe propagating degrees of freedom that do not gravitate. The algebra of diffeomorphisms includes field-dependent structure constants and only closes on-shell, as predicted by the type II SFT gauge algebra.</description>

      <title>A Celestial Kinematical Interpretation for an Extended BMS$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Longhi and Materassi, who constructed a realisation of the (centreless) BMS$_4$ algebra for the massive Klein-Gordon field in $3+1$, we build a realisation of the (centreless) BMS$_4$ algebra including super-rotations by using celestial coordinates. This realisation depends only on the momenta in the lightcone in the celestial coordinates without any reference to the Klein--Gordon field. The quadratic Casimir of the Lorentz algebra written in terms of a second order differential operator and the volume form plays an essential role in this construction. The BMS algebra in terms of vector fields shows its kinematical nature, like the Poincar\'e algebra. We also construct a dynamical realisation of BMS from the symplectic structure on the solutions of the massless four-dimensional Klein--Gordon field in terms of quadratic expressions of the Fourier modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.03898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting with a supersymmetric U(N)xU(N) gauge theory built in N=1 superspace, a nonsupersymmetric theory is obtained by ``twisting'' the gauginos into a different representation of the group than the gauge bosons. Despite the fact that this twisting breaks supersymmetry, it is still possible to construct an action that is holomorphic and invariant to local ``twisted'' gauge transformations in superspace. It is conjectured that these two properties may allow the theory to be free of quadratic divergences to all orders, despite a lack of supersymmetry. An explicit calculation shows that the theory is free of quadratic divergences to at least the two-loop order.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the values of observables in chiral eigenstates of the XX quantum spin chain that were introduced in previous work and compare the form of the result with the respective expressions obtained in the more familiar eigenbasis of states with fixed magnetization in the $z$ direction. We carry out the diagonalization of the XY spin chain in the chiral basis. We calculate the norm of the chiral XY eigenstates, and the values of the one-point functions and some neighbor two-point correlation functions. We interpret the spectrum and the particle content of the XY chain in terms of scattering states of an even number of kink and antikink excitations that are created over a reduced Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Charged black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ is the curvature scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). To construct our solutions, we adopt a linear functional form, $f(R,T) = R + \beta T$. In the limit $\beta = 0$, the theory reduces to General Relativity (GR), recovering $f(R,T) \approx R$. We propose a power-law Lagrangian of the form $\mathcal{L} = f_0 + F + \alpha F^p$, where $\alpha =f_0= 0$ corresponds to the linear electrodynamics case. Using this setup, we derive the metric functions and determine an effective cosmological constant. Our analysis focuses on specific cases with $p = 2$, $p = 4$, and $p = 6$, where we formulate analytic expressions for the matter fields supporting these solutions in terms of the Lagrangian as a function of $F$. Additionally, we verify the regularity of the solutions and study the structure of the event horizons. Furthermore, we examine a more specific scenario by determining the free forms of the first and second derivatives $\mathcal{L}_F(r)$ and $\mathcal{L}_{FF}(r)$ of the Lagrangean of the nonlinear electromagnetic field. From these relations, we derive the general form of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{NLED}}(r)$ using consistency relations. This Lagrangian exhibits an intrinsic nonlinearity due to the influence of two constants, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Specifically, $\alpha$ originates from the power-law term in the proposed Lagrangian, while $\beta$ arises from the assumed linear function $f(R,T)$. The interplay of these constants ensures that the nonlinearity of the Lagrangian is governed by both $\alpha$ and $\beta$, rather than $\alpha$ alone.</description>

      <title>Testing inflation on all scales: a case study with $\alpha$-attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plethora of inflationary models can produce interesting small-scale phenomenology, such as enhanced scalar fluctuations leading to primordial black hole (PBH) production and large scalar-induced GW. Nevertheless, good models must simultaneously explain current observations on all scales. In this work, we showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of inflationary models on firm grounds. We consider the case of hybrid $\alpha$-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two potential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the scalar power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$, and its amplitude. We first constrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating phase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale constraints shrinks for extended reheating stages. We then move to smaller scales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type and has amplitude $f_\text{NL}\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This ensures that non-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of induced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests. The former allows us to further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which over-produce PBHs. We find that a subset of viable models can lead to significant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for LISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical foregrounds. Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at different scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations and theoretical consistency requirements.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(N)/H$ nonlinear $\sigma$ models at nonzero $\theta$ angles</title>

Abstract: A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N &gt;2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\sigma$ models at $\theta=\pi$.</description>

      <title>Parity violation as enforced symmetry breaking in 3D fermionic topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent incompatibilities, a phenomenon known as enforced symmetry breaking (ESB) in the framework of topological order. In our previous work, we developed a systematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order. Meanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of the most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional fermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins of parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related to the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\times Z_2\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such fTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show that the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison, conventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also discuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, could be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which are to be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Hadrons in group expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various approximate symmetries exist in nature. For example, the flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange/charm$ quarks is severely broken, the flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange$ quarks is moderately broken, and the isospin $SU(2)$ symmetry involving the $up/down$ quarks is slightly broken. These broken symmetries are primarily governed by the strong interaction, making them an ideal platform for investigating the general behavior of approximate symmetries. To explore the application of the flavor $SU(4)$ group to ground-state baryons, we systematically calculate the transition matrices associated with various flavor $SU(4)$ representations as well as the matrices that describe their connections. These matrices are then employed to analyze the mass spectrum of ground-state baryons. Our results indicate that these states can be described as mixtures of various flavor representations, such as $\Sigma_c/\Xi_c^\prime/\Omega_c \sim \mathbf{20_M} \oplus \mathbf{20_S}\oplus \mathbf{\bar{4}_A}~[SU(4)]$, $\Xi_c/\Xi_c^\prime \sim \mathbf{\bar 3_A} \oplus \mathbf{6_S}~[SU(3)]$, $\Lambda^0/\Sigma^0 \sim \mathbf{1_A} \oplus \mathbf{3_S}~[SU(2)]$, where the subscripts $\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}$ denote the symmetric, antisymmetric, and mixed flavor wave functions, respectively. Our results also indicate that the flavor symmetries, as they break, necessitate the mixing of these flavor representations according to specific rules.</description>
