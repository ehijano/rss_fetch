      <title>Dueling QR Codes: The Hyding of Dr. Jeckyl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for encoding dual messages within standard Quick Response (QR) codes through precise half-pixel module splitting. This work challenges fundamental assumptions about deterministic decoding in the ISO/IEC 18004:2015 standard while maintaining complete compatibility with existing QR infrastructure. The proposed two-dimensional barcode attack enables angle-dependent message selection while maintaining compatibility with unmodified QR readers and the 100 million US mobile users who use their phone's built-in scanners. Unlike previous approaches that rely on nested codes, watermarking, or error correction exploitation, our method achieves true one-to-many mapping by manipulating the physical sampling process built into the QR standard. By preserving critical function patterns while bifurcating data modules, we create automated codes that produce different but valid readings based on camera viewing angle. Experimental results demonstrate successful implementation across multiple use cases, including simple message text pairs, complex URLs (nsa.gov/nasa.gov), and security test patterns for malware and spam detectors (EICAR/GTUBE). Our technique achieves reliable dual-message decoding using standard QR readers at module scales of 9-11 pixels, with successful angle-dependent reading demonstrated across vertical, horizontal, and diagonal orientations. The method's success suggests potential applications beyond QR code phishing ('quishing') including two-factor authentication, anti-counterfeiting, and information density optimization. The half-pixel technique may offer future avenues for similar implementations in other 2D barcode formats such as Data Matrix and Aztec Code.</description>

      <title>BodySense: An Expandable and Wearable-Sized Wireless Evaluation Platform for Human Body Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable, wirelessly connected sensors have become a common part of daily life and have the potential to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of personalized healthcare. A key challenge in this evolution is designing long-lasting and unobtrusive devices. These design requirements inherently demand smaller batteries, inevitably increasing the need for energy-sensitive wireless communication interfaces. Capacitive Human Body Communication (HBC) is a promising, power-efficient alternative to traditional RF-based communication, enabling point-to-multipoint data and energy exchange. However, as this concept relies on capacitive coupling to the surrounding area, it is naturally influenced by uncontrollable environmental factors, making testing with classical setups particularly challenging. This work presents a customizable, wearable-sized, wireless evaluation platform for capacitive HBC, designed to enable realistic evaluation of wearable-to-wearable applications. Comparative measurements of channel gains were conducted using classical grid-connected and wireless Data Acquisition (DAQ) across various transmission distances within the frequency range of 4 MHz to 64 MHz and revealed an average overestimation of 18.15 dB over all investigated distances in the classical setup.</description>

      <title>A novel Fourier Adjacency Transformer for advanced EEG emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG emotion recognition faces significant hurdles due to noise interference, signal nonstationarity, and the inherent complexity of brain activity which make accurately emotion classification. In this study, we present the Fourier Adjacency Transformer, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates Fourier-based periodic analysis with graph-driven structural modeling. Our method first leverages novel Fourier-inspired modules to extract periodic features from embedded EEG signals, effectively decoupling them from aperiodic components. Subsequently, we employ an adjacency attention scheme to reinforce universal inter-channel correlation patterns, coupling these patterns with their sample-based counterparts. Empirical evaluations on SEED and DEAP datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an improvement of approximately 6.5% in recognition accuracy. By unifying periodicity and structural insights, this framework offers a promising direction for future research in EEG emotion analysis.</description>

      <title>A CGAN-LSTM-Based Framework for Time-Varying Non-Stationary Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying non-stationary channels, with complex dynamic variations and temporal evolution characteristics, have significant challenges in channel modeling and communication system performance evaluation. Most existing methods of time-varying channel modeling focus on predicting channel state at a given moment or simulating short-term channel fluctuations, which are unable to capture the long-term evolution of the channel. This paper emphasizes the generation of long-term dynamic channel to fully capture evolution of non-stationary channel properties. The generated channel not only reflects temporal dynamics but also ensures consistent stationarity. We propose a hybrid deep learning framework that combines conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. A stationarity-constrained approach is designed to ensure temporal correlation of the generated time-series channel. This method can generate channel with required temporal non-stationarity. The model is validated by comparing channel statistical features, and the results show that the generated channel is in good agreement with raw channel and provides good performance in terms of non-stationarity.</description>

      <title>Conditional Electrocardiogram Generation Using Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are disorders impacting the heart and circulatory system. These disorders are the foremost and continuously escalating cause of mortality worldwide. One of the main tasks when working with CVDs is analyzing and identifying pathologies on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a standard 10-second duration. Using machine learning (ML) in automatic ECG analysis increases CVD diagnostics' availability, speed, and accuracy. However, the most significant difficulty in developing ML models is obtaining a sufficient training dataset. Due to the limitations of medical data usage, such as expensiveness, errors, the ambiguity of labels, imbalance of classes, and privacy issues, utilizing synthetic samples depending on specific pathologies bypasses these restrictions and improves algorithm quality. Existing solutions for the conditional generation of ECG signals are mainly built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and only a few papers consider the architectures based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), showing comparable results in recent works. This paper proposes the publicly available conditional Nouveau VAE model for ECG signal generation (cNVAE-ECG), which produces high-resolution ECGs with multiple pathologies. We provide an extensive comparison of the proposed model on various practical downstream tasks, including transfer learning scenarios showing an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) increase up to 2% surpassing GAN-like competitors.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Lead-Specific Modeling of ECG for Low-Cost Pulmonary Hypertension Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is frequently underdiagnosed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) primarily due to the scarcity of advanced diagnostic tools. Several studies in PH have applied machine learning to low-cost diagnostic tools like 12-lead ECG (12L-ECG), but they mainly focus on areas with limited resources, overlooking areas with no diagnostic tools, such as rural primary healthcare in LMICs. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of 6-lead ECG (6L-ECG), as a cheaper and portable alternative in detecting various cardiac conditions, but its clinical value for PH detection is not well proved. Furthermore, existing methods treat 12L-/6L-ECG as a single modality, capturing only shared features while overlooking lead-specific features essential for identifying complex cardiac hemodynamic changes. In this paper, we propose Lead-Specific Electrocardiogram Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (LS-EMVAE), a model pre-trained on large-population 12L-ECG data and fine-tuned on task-specific data (12L-ECG or 6L-ECG). LS-EMVAE models each 12L-ECG lead as a separate modality and introduces a hierarchical expert composition using Mixture and Product of Experts for adaptive latent feature fusion between lead-specific and shared features. Unlike existing approaches, LS-EMVAE makes better predictions on both 12L-ECG and 6L-ECG at inference, making it an equitable solution for areas with limited or no diagnostic tools. We pre-trained LS-EMVAE on 800,000 publicly available 12L-ECG samples and fine-tuned it for two tasks: 1) PH detection and 2) phenotyping pre-/post-capillary PH, on in-house datasets of 892 and 691 subjects across 12L-ECG and 6L-ECG settings. Extensive experiments show that LS-EMVAE outperforms existing baselines in both ECG settings, while 6L-ECG achieves performance comparable to 12L-ECG, unlocking its potential for global PH screening in areas without diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>Medical Support System for Spontaneous Breathing Trial Prediction Using Nonuniform Discrete Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) represent a pivotal phase in the weaning process of mechanically ventilated patients. The objective of these trials is to assess patients readiness to resume independent breathing, thereby facilitating timely weaning and reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV). Nevertheless, accurately predicting the success or failure of SBT remains a significant challenge in clinical practice. This study proposes a healthcare system that employs machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of SBT. The model is trained on respiratory flow and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, employing the non-uniform discrete Fourier transform (NUDFT) for frequency domain analysis. The SBT prediction model has the potential to significantly enhance clinical decision-making by enabling the early identification of patients at risk for SBT failure, achieving an accuracy of 84.4.</description>

      <title>Toward Scalable Access to Neurodevelopmental Screening: Insights, Implementation, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Children with neurodevelopmental disorders require timely intervention to improve long-term outcomes, yet early screening remains inaccessible in many regions. A scalable solution integrating standardized assessments with physiological data collection, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, could enable early detection in routine settings by non-specialists.
  To address this, we introduce NeuroNest, a mobile and cloud-based platform for large-scale EEG data collection, neurodevelopmental screening, and research. We provide a comprehensive review of existing behavioral and biomarker-based approaches, consumer-grade EEG devices, and emerging machine learning techniques. NeuroNest integrates low-cost EEG devices with digital screening tools, establishing a scalable, open-source infrastructure for non-invasive data collection, automated analysis, and interoperability across diverse hardware.
  Beyond the system architecture and reference implementation, we highlight key challenges in EEG data standardization, device interoperability, and bridging behavioral and physiological assessments. Our findings emphasize the need for future research on standardized data exchange, algorithm validation, and ecosystem development to expand screening accessibility. By providing an extensible, open-source system, NeuroNest advances machine learning-based early detection while fostering collaboration in screening technologies, clinical applications, and public health.</description>

      <title>Robust Detection of Extremely Thin Lines Using 0.2mm Piano Wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study developed an algorithm capable of detecting a reference line (a 0.2 mm thick piano wire) to accurately determine the position of an automated installation robot within an elevator shaft. A total of 3,245 images were collected from the experimental tower of H Company, the leading elevator manufacturer in South Korea, and the detection performance was evaluated using four experimental approaches (GCH, GSCH, GECH, FCH). During the initial image processing stage, Gaussian blurring, sharpening filter, embossing filter, and Fourier Transform were applied, followed by Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform. Notably, the method was developed to accurately extract the reference line by averaging the x-coordinates of the lines detected through the Hough Transform. This approach enabled the detection of the 0.2 mm thick piano wire with high accuracy, even in the presence of noise and other interfering factors (e.g., concrete cracks inside the elevator shaft or safety bars for filming equipment). The experimental results showed that Experiment 4 (FCH), which utilized Fourier Transform in the preprocessing stage, achieved the highest detection rate for the LtoL, LtoR, and RtoL datasets. Experiment 2(GSCH), which applied Gaussian blurring and a sharpening filter, demonstrated superior detection performance on the RtoR dataset. This study proposes a reference line detection algorithm that enables precise position calculation and control of automated robots in elevator shaft installation. Moreover, the developed method shows potential for applicability even in confined working spaces. Future work aims to develop a line detection algorithm equipped with machine learning-based hyperparameter tuning capabilities.</description>

      <title>ISLS: An IoT-Based Smart Lighting System for Improving Energy Conservation in Office Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the Internet of Things (IoT) fostering seamless device-to-human and device-to-device interactions, the domain of intelligent lighting systems have evolved beyond simple occupancy and daylight sensing towards autonomous monitoring and control of power consumption and illuminance levels. To this regard, this paper proposes a new do-it-yourself (DIY) IoT-based method of smart lighting system featuring an illuminance control algorithm. The design involves the integration of occupancy and presence sensors alongside a communication module, to enable real-time wireless interaction and remote monitoring of the system parameters from any location through an end-user application. A constrained optimization problem was formulated to determine the optimal dimming vector for achieving target illuminance at minimal power consumption. The simplex algorithm was used to solve this problem, and the system's performance was validated through both MATLAB simulations and real-world prototype testing in an indoor office environment. The obtained experimental results demonstrate substantial power savings across multiple user occupancy scenarios, achieving reductions of approx. 80%, 48%, and 26% for one, two, and four user settings, respectively, in comparison to traditional basic lighting installation systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Subject Depression Level Classification Using EEG Signals with a Sample Confidence Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive tool for real-time neural monitoring,widely used in depression detection via deep learning. However, existing models primarily focus on binary classification (depression/normal), lacking granularity for severity assessment. To address this, we proposed the DepL-GCN, i.e., Depression Level classification based on GCN model. This model tackles two key challenges: (1) subjectivity in depres-sion-level labeling due to patient self-report biases, and (2) class imbalance across severity categories. Inspired by the model learning patterns, we introduced two novel modules: the sample confidence module and the minority sample penalty module. The former leverages the L2-norm of prediction errors to progressively filter EEG samples with weak label alignment during training, thereby reducing the impact of subjectivity; the latter automatically upweights misclassified minority-class samples to address imbalance issues. After testing on two public EEG datasets, DepL-GCN achieved accuracies of 81.13% and 81.36% for multi-class severity recognition, outperforming baseline models.Ablation studies confirmed both modules' contributions. We further discussed the strengths and limitations of regression-based models for depression-level recognition.</description>

      <title>Radar Pulse Deinterleaving with Transformer Based Deep Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When receiving radar pulses it is common for a recorded pulse train to contain pulses from many different emitters. The radar pulse deinterleaving problem is the task of separating out these pulses by the emitter from which they originated. Notably, the number of emitters in any particular recorded pulse train is considered unknown. In this paper, we define the problem and present metrics that can be used to measure model performance. We propose a metric learning approach to this problem using a transformer trained with the triplet loss on synthetic data. This model achieves strong results in comparison with other deep learning models with an adjusted mutual information score of 0.882.</description>

Abstract: Highway work zones are critical areas where accidents frequently occur, often due to the proximity of workers to heavy machinery and ongoing traffic. With technological advancements in sensor technologies and the Internet of Things, promising solutions are emerging to address these safety concerns. This paper provides a systematic review of existing studies on the application of sensor technologies in enhancing highway work zone safety, particularly in preventing intrusion and proximity hazards. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, the review examines a broad spectrum of publications on various sensor technologies, including GPS, radar, laser, infrared, RFID, Bluetooth, ultrasonic, and infrared sensors, detailing their application in reducing intrusion and proximity incidents. The review also assesses these technologies in terms of their accuracy, range, power consumption, cost, and user-friendliness, with a specific emphasis on their suitability for highway work zones. The findings highlight the potential of sensor technologies to significantly enhance work zone safety. As there are a wide range of sensor technologies to choose from, the review also revealed that selection of sensors for a particular application needs careful consideration of different factors. Finally, while sensor technologies offer promising solutions for enhancing highway work zone safety, their effective implementation requires comprehensive consideration of various factors beyond technological capabilities, including developing integrated, cost-effective, user-friendly, and secure systems, and creating regulatory frameworks to support the rapid development of these technologies.</description>

      <title>EAGLE: Contextual Point Cloud Generation via Adaptive Continuous Normalizing Flow with Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 3D point clouds become the prevailing shape representation in computer vision, how to generate high-resolution point clouds has become a pressing issue. Flow-based generative models can effectively perform point cloud generation tasks. However, traditional CNN-based flow architectures rely only on local information to extract features, making it difficult to capture global contextual information. Inspired by the wide adoption of Transformers, we explored the complementary roles of self-attention mechanisms in Transformers, CNN, and continuous normalizing flows. To this end, we propose a probabilistic model via adaptive normalizing flows and self-attention. Our idea leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture global contextual information. We also propose adaptive continuous normalizing flows by introducing adaptive bias correction mechanism. Combined with normalization, the mechanism dynamically handles different input contexts and mitigates potential bias-shift issues from standard initialization. Experimental results demonstrate that EAGLE achieves competitive performance in point cloud generation.</description>

      <title>WVEmbs with its Masking: A Method For Radar Signal Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study proposes a novel embedding method, Wide-Value-Embeddings (WVEmbs), for processing Pulse Descriptor Words (PDWs) as normalized inputs to neural networks. This method adapts to the distribution of interleaved radar signals, ranking original signal features from trivial to useful and stabilizing the learning process. To address the imbalance in radar signal interleaving, we introduce a value dimension masking method on WVEmbs, which automatically and efficiently generates challenging samples, and constructs interleaving scenarios, thereby compelling the model to learn robust features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is an efficient end-to-end approach, achieving high-granularity, sample-level pulse sorting for high-density interleaved radar pulse sequences in complex and non-ideal environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an on-chip antenna at 290 GHz that achieves a maximum efficiency of 42\% on a low-resistivity silicon substrate for sub-terahertz integrated transceivers. The proposed antenna is based on a dual-slot structure to accommodate a limited ground plane and maintain desired radiation and impedance characteristics across the target frequency range. The antenna impedance bandwidth reaches 39\% with compact physical dimensions of 0.24$\lambda_0\times$0.42$\lambda_0$. Simulation and measurement results confirm its promising antenna performance for potential transceiver and radar applications.</description>

      <title>Using Test-Time Data Augmentation for Cross-Domain Atrial Fibrillation Detection from ECG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is crucial for early diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. However, deploying robust AF detection models across different datasets with significant domain variations remains a challenge. In this paper, we use test-time data augmentation (TTA) to address the cross-domain problem and enhance AF detection performance. We use a publicly available dataset for training - Physionet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 -, while collecting a distinct test set, creating a cross-domain scenario. We employ a neural network architecture that integrates transformer-based encoding of ECG signals and convolutional layers for spectrogram feature extraction. The model combines the latent representations obtained from both encoders to classify the input signals. By incorporating TTA during inference, we enhance the model's performance, achieving an F1 score of 76.6\% on our test set. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the model becomes more resilient to perturbations in the input signal, enhancing its robustness. We show that TTA can be effective in addressing the cross-domain problem, where training and test data originate from disparate sources. This work contributes to advancing the field of AF detection in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for triage of strokes with large vessel occlusion using photoplethysmography biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. Large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke presents a major challenge in clinical practice due to the potential for poor outcomes with delayed treatment. Treatment for LVO involves highly specialized care, in particular endovascular thrombectomy, and is available only at certain hospitals. Therefore, prehospital identification of LVO by emergency ambulance services, can be critical for triaging LVO stroke patients directly to a hospital with access to endovascular therapy. Clinical scores exist to help distinguish LVO from less severe strokes, but they are based on a series of examinations that can take minutes and may be impractical for patients with dementia or those who cannot follow commands due to their stroke. There is a need for a fast and reliable method to aid in the early identification of LVO. In this study, our objective was to assess the feasibility of using 30-second photoplethysmography (PPG) recording to assist in recognizing LVO stroke. Method. A total of 88 patients, including 25 with LVO, 27 with stroke mimic (SM), and 36 non-LVO stroke patients (NL), were recorded at the Liverpool Hospital emergency department in Sydney, Australia. Demographics (age, sex), as well as morphological features and beating rate variability measures, were extracted from the PPG. A binary classification approach was employed to differentiate between LVO stroke and NL+SM (NL.SM). A 2:1 train-test split was stratified and repeated randomly across 100 iterations. Results. The best model achieved a median test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.77 (0.71--0.82). \textit{Conclusion.} Our study demonstrates the potential of utilizing a 30-second PPG recording for identifying LVO stroke.</description>

      <title>Onboard Terrain Classification via Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Diffractive Deep Neural Networks from SAR Level-0 Raw Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for real-time onboard terrain classification from Sentinel-1 (S1) level-0 raw In-phase/Quadrature (IQ) data, leveraging a Stacked Intelligent Metasurface (SIM) to perform inference directly in the analog wave domain. Unlike conventional digital deep neural networks, the proposed multi-layer Diffractive Deep Neural Network (D$^2$NN) setup implements automatic feature extraction as electromagnetic waves propagate through stacked metasurface layers. This design not only reduces reliance on expensive downlink bandwidth and high-power computing at terrestrial stations but also achieves performance levels around 90\% directly from the real raw IQ data, in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. Our method therefore helps bridge the gap between next-generation remote sensing tasks and in-orbit processing needs, paving the way for computationally efficient remote sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Cascade of one-class classifier ensemble and dynamic naive Bayes classifier applied to the myoelectric-based upper limb prosthesis control with contaminated channels detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by sEMG signals using a pattern recognition scheme in the control process. Unfortunately, the sEMG signal is very susceptible to contamination that deteriorates the quality of the control system and reduces the usefulness of the prosthesis in the patient's everyday life. In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for sEMG-based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated sEMG signals. The originality of the proposed solution lies in the co-operation of two recognition systems working in a cascade structure: (1) an ensemble of one-class classifiers used to recognise contaminated signals and (2) a naive Bayes classifier (NBC) which recognises the patient's intentions using the information about contaminations produced by the ensemble. Although in the proposed approach, the NBC model is changed dynamically, due to the multiplicative form of the classification functions, training can be performed in a one-shot procedure. Experimental studies were conducted using real sEMG signals. The results obtained confirm the hypothesis that the use of the one-class classifier ensemble and the dynamic NBC model leads to improved classification quality.</description>

      <title>FLP-XR: Future Location Prediction on Extreme Scale Maritime Data in Real-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movements of maritime vessels are inherently complex and challenging to model due to the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of maritime operations. Even within structured maritime environments, such as shipping lanes and port approaches, where vessels adhere to navigational rules and predefined sea routes, uncovering underlying patterns is far from trivial. The necessity for accurate modeling of the mobility of maritime vessels arises from the numerous applications it serves, including risk assessment for collision avoidance, optimization of shipping routes, and efficient port management. This paper introduces FLP-XR, a model that leverages maritime mobility data to construct a robust framework that offers precise predictions while ensuring extremely fast training and inference capabilities. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through an extensive experimental study using three real-world AIS datasets. According to the experimental results, FLP-XR outperforms the current state-of-the-art in many cases, whereas it performs 2-3 orders of magnitude faster in terms of training and inference.</description>

      <title>Event-Driven Implementation of a Physical Reservoir Computing Framework for superficial EMG-based Gesture Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable health devices have a strong demand in real-time biomedical signal processing. However traditional methods often require data transmission to centralized processing unit with substantial computational resources after collecting it from edge devices. Neuromorphic computing is an emerging field that seeks to design specialized hardware for computing systems inspired by the structure, function, and dynamics of the human brain, offering significant advantages in latency and power consumption. This paper explores a novel neuromorphic implementation approach for gesture recognition by extracting spatiotemporal spiking information from surface electromyography (sEMG) data in an event-driven manner. At the same time, the network was designed by implementing a simple-structured and hardware-friendly Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC) framework called Rotating Neuron Reservoir (RNR) within the domain of Spiking neural network (SNN). The spiking RNR (sRNR) is promising to pipeline an innovative solution to compact embedded wearable systems, enabling low-latency, real-time processing directly at the sensor level. The proposed system was validated by an open-access large-scale sEMG database and achieved an average classification accuracy of 74.6\% and 80.3\% using a classical machine learning classifier and a delta learning rule algorithm respectively. While the delta learning rule could be fully spiking and implementable on neuromorphic chips, the proposed gesture recognition system demonstrates the potential for near-sensor low-latency processing.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Learning-based Offshore Wind Power Prediction Models with Various Feature Combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate wind speed prediction is crucial for designing and selecting sites for offshore wind farms. This paper investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting offshore wind power for a site near the Gulf of Mexico by analyzing meteorological data. After collecting and preprocessing meteorological data, nine different input feature combinations were designed to assess their impact on wind power predictions at multiple heights. The results show that using wind speed as the output feature improves prediction accuracy by approximately 10% compared to using wind power as the output. In addition, the improvement of multi-feature input compared with single-feature input is not obvious mainly due to the poor correlation among key features and limited generalization ability of models. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate output features and highlight considerations for using machine learning in wind power forecasting, offering insights that could guide future wind power prediction models and conversion techniques.</description>

      <title>TransECG: Leveraging Transformers for Explainable ECG Re-identification Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are widely shared across multiple clinical applications for diagnosis, health monitoring, and biometric authentication. While valuable for healthcare, they also carry unique biometric identifiers that pose privacy risks, especially when ECG data shared across multiple entities. These risks are amplified in shared environments, where re-identification threats can compromise patient privacy. Existing deep learning re-identification models prioritize accuracy but lack explainability, making it challenging to understand how the unique biometric characteristics encoded within ECG signals are recognized and utilized for identification. Without these insights, despite high accuracy, developing secure and trustable ECG data-sharing frameworks remains difficult, especially in diverse, multi-source environments. In this work, we introduce TransECG, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based method that uses attention mechanisms to pinpoint critical ECG segments associated with re-identification tasks like gender, age, and participant ID. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy (89.9% for gender, 89.9% for age, and 88.6% for ID re-identification) across four real-world datasets with 87 participants. Importantly, we provide key insights into ECG components such as the R-wave, QRS complex, and P-Q interval in re-identification. For example, in the gender classification, the R wave contributed 58.29% to the model's attention, while in the age classification, the P-R interval contributed 46.29%. By combining high predictive performance with enhanced explainability, TransECG provides a robust solution for privacy-conscious ECG data sharing, supporting the development of secure and trusted healthcare data environment.</description>

      <title>Finger-to-Chest Style Transfer-assisted Deep Learning Method For Photoplethysmogram Waveform Restoration with Timing Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable measurements, such as those obtained by photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors are highly susceptible to motion artifacts and noise, affecting cardiovascular measures. Chest-acquired PPG signals are especially vulnerable, with signal degradation primarily resulting from lower perfusion, breathing-induced motion, and mechanical interference from chest movements. Traditional restoration methods often degrade the signal, and supervised deep learning (DL) struggles with random and systematic distortions, requiring very large datasets for successful training. To efficiently restore chest PPG waveform, we propose a style transfer-assisted cycle-consistent generative adversarial network, called starGAN, whose performance is evaluated on a three-channel PPG signal (red, green,and infrared) acquired by a chest-worn multi-modal sensor, called Soundi. Two identical devices are adopted, one sensor to collect the PPG signal on the chest, considered to feature low quality and undergoing restoration, and another sensor to obtain a high-quality PPG signal measured on the finger, considered the reference signal. Extensive validation over some 8,000 5-second chunks collected from 40 subjects showed about 90% correlation of the restored chest PPG with the reference finger PPG, with a 30% improvement over raw chest PPG. Likewise, the signal-to-noise ratio improved on average of about 125%, over the three channels. The agreement with heart-rate computed from concurrent ECG was extremely high, overcoming 84% on average. These results demonstrate effective signal restoration, comparable with findings in recent literature papers. Significance: PPG signals collected from wearable devices are highly susceptible to artifacts, making innovative AI-based techniques fundamental towards holistic health assessments in a single device.</description>

      <title>Is Limited Participant Diversity Impeding EEG-based Machine Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) to electroencephalography (EEG) has great potential to advance both neuroscientific research and clinical applications. However, the generalisability and robustness of EEG-based ML models often hinge on the amount and diversity of training data. It is common practice to split EEG recordings into small segments, thereby increasing the number of samples substantially compared to the number of individual recordings or participants. We conceptualise this as a multi-level data generation process and investigate the scaling behaviour of model performance with respect to the overall sample size and the participant diversity through large-scale empirical studies. We then use the same framework to investigate the effectiveness of different ML strategies designed to address limited data problems: data augmentations and self-supervised learning. Our findings show that model performance scaling can be severely constrained by participant distribution shifts and provide actionable guidance for data collection and ML research.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Knowledge Discovery from Sensors Data to Improve Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increases in energy prices and the global goal of mitigating CO2 emissions necessitate the development of intelligent Building Management Systems (BMS) that operate on an energy-efficient basis. Data Centers, buildings and/or group of buildings are often responsible for huge energy consumption. One way to monitor and optimize energy consumption is to instrument buildings using sensors (temperature, pressure, humidity ...) in order to track and solve wrong usage of energy management systems. The majority of the BMS are processing the data dynamically without taking into account the data history due to their constraint problems (time, bandwidth and calculation capability) and data resources. The RIDER project brings together a consortium of research laboratories and enterprises including IBM, to share their expertise in research and development of smart Information Technology (IT) energy platforms. In this context, we aim to improve energy efficiency of buildings or group of building (including data centers) using IT. One of the objectives is to identify valid, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data for improving energy efficiency. We propose in this paper an approach of using an integrated platform able to interconnect instrumented buildings and sites, and to provide a high-level point of view for increasing our knowledge from sensors. The expected results are to estimate physical parameters that influence energy consumption based on data set history. Different correlation could be found between different variables, for example, indoor air quality and energy consumption. These results could be applied at a location where no sensor is placed and predict energy consumption from different variables.</description>

      <title>Internet of Things-Based Smart Precision Farming in Soilless Agriculture: Opportunities and Challenges for Global Food Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population and the continuous decline in cultivable land pose significant threats to food security. This challenge worsens as climate change further reduces the availability of farmland. Soilless agriculture, such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, offers a sustainable solution by enabling efficient crop cultivation in controlled environments. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart precision farming improves resource efficiency, automates environmental control, and ensures stable and high-yield crop production. IoT-enabled smart farming systems utilize real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and automation to optimize water and nutrient usage while minimizing human intervention. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of IoT-based soilless farming, highlighting its role in sustainable agriculture, urban farming, and global food security. These advanced farming methods ensure greater productivity, resource conservation, and year-round cultivation. However, they also face challenges such as high initial investment, technological dependency, and energy consumption. Through a comprehensive study, bibliometric analysis, and comparative analysis, this research highlights current trends and research gaps. It also outlines future directions for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation and scalability in IoT-driven soilless agriculture. By emphasizing the benefits of vertical farming and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)-enabled soilless techniques, this paper supports informed decision-making to address food security challenges and promote sustainable agricultural innovations.</description>

      <title>Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of RUL for lithium-ion batteries is crucial for enhancing the reliability and longevity of energy storage systems. Traditional methods for RUL prediction often struggle with issues such as data sparsity, varying battery chemistries, and the inability to capture complex degradation patterns over time. In this study, we propose a survival analysis-based framework combined with deep learning models to predict the RUL of lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, we utilize five advanced models: the Cox-type models (Cox, CoxPH, and CoxTime) and two machine-learning-based models (DeepHit and MTLR). These models address the challenges of accurate RUL estimation by transforming raw time-series battery data into survival data, including key degradation indicators such as voltage, current, and internal resistance. Advanced feature extraction techniques enhance the model's robustness in diverse real-world scenarios, including varying charging conditions and battery chemistries. Our models are tested using 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring generalizability and minimizing overfitting. Experimental results show that our survival-based framework significantly improves RUL prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods, providing a reliable tool for battery management and maintenance optimization. This study contributes to the advancement of predictive maintenance in battery technology, offering valuable insights for both researchers and industry practitioners aiming to enhance the operational lifespan of lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Classification of power quality events in the transmission grid: comparative evaluation of different machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic classification of electric power quality events with respect to their root causes is critical for electrical grid management. In this paper, we present comparative evaluation results of an extensive set of machine learning models for the classification of power quality events, based on their root causes. After extensive experiments using different machine learning libraries, it is observed that the best performing learning models turn out to be Cubic SVM and XGBoost. During error analysis, it is observed that the main source of performance degradation for both models is the classification of ABC faults as ABCG faults, or vice versa. Ultimately, the models achieving the best results will be integrated into the event classification module of a large-scale power quality and grid monitoring system for the Turkish electricity transmission system.</description>

      <title>Convolutional neural network for early detection of lameness and irregularity in horses using an IMU sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lameness and gait irregularities are significant concerns in equine health management, affecting performance, welfare, and economic value. Traditional observational methods rely on subjective expert assessments, which can lead to inconsistencies in detecting subtle or early-stage lameness. While AI-based approaches have emerged, many require multiple sensors, force plates, or video systems, making them costly and impractical for field deployment. In this applied research study, we present a stride-level classification system that utilizes a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) to objectively differentiate between sound and lame horses, with a primary focus on the trot gait. The proposed system was tested under real-world conditions, achieving a 90% session-level accuracy with no false positives, demonstrating its robustness for practical applications. By employing a single, non-intrusive, and readily available sensor, our approach significantly reduces the complexity and cost of hardware requirements while maintaining high classification performance. These results highlight the potential of our CNN-based method as a field-tested, scalable solution for automated lameness detection. By enabling early diagnosis, this system offers a valuable tool for preventing minor gait irregularities from developing into severe conditions, ultimately contributing to improved equine welfare and performance in veterinary and equestrian practice.</description>

      <title>Single Sparse Graph Enhanced Expectation Propagation Algorithm Design for Uplink MIMO-SCMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) are considered as two efficient techniques to provide both massive connectivity and high spectrum efficiency for future machine-type wireless networks. This paper proposes a single sparse graph (SSG) enhanced expectation propagation algorithm (EPA) receiver, referred to as SSG-EPA, for uplink MIMO-SCMA systems. Firstly, we reformulate the sparse codebook mapping process using a linear encoding model, which transforms the variable nodes (VNs) of SCMA from symbol-level to bit-level VNs. Such transformation facilitates the integration of the VNs of SCMA and low-density parity-check (LDPC), thereby emerging the SCMA and LDPC graphs into a SSG. Subsequently, to further reduce the detection complexity, the message propagation between SCMA VNs and function nodes (FNs) are designed based on EPA principles. Different from the existing iterative detection and decoding (IDD) structure, the proposed EPA-SSG allows a simultaneously detection and decoding at each iteration, and eliminates the use of interleavers, de-interleavers, symbol-to-bit, and bit-to-symbol LLR transformations. Simulation results show that the proposed SSG-EPA achieves better error rate performance compared to the state-of-the-art schemes.</description>

      <title>Send Pilot or Data? Leveraging Age of Channel State Information for Throughput Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal timing for pilot and data transmissions to maximize effective throughput, also known as goodput, over a wireless fading channel. The receiver utilizes the received pilot signal and its Age of Information (AoI), termed the Age of Channel State Information (AoCSI), to estimate the channel state. Based on this estimation, the transmitter selects an appropriate modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to maximize goodput while ensuring compliance with a predefined block error probability constraint. Furthermore, we design an optimal pilot scheduling policy that determines whether to transmit a pilot or data at each time step, with the objective of maximizing the long-term average goodput. This problem involves a non-monotonic AoI metric optimization challenge, as the goodput function is non-monotonic with respect to AoCSI. The numerical results illustrate the performance gains achieved by the proposed policy under various SNR levels and mobility speeds.</description>

      <title>Joint Array Partitioning and Beamforming Designs in ISAC Systems: A Bayesian CRB Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation (6G) wireless networks, unifying radar sensing and communication on a shared hardware platform. This paper proposes a dynamic array partitioning framework for monostatic ISAC systems to fully exploit available spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) and reconfigurable antenna topologies, enhancing sensing performance in complex scenarios. We first establish a theoretical foundation for our work by deriving Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds (BCRBs) under prior distribution constraints for heterogeneous target models, encompassing both point-like and extended targets. Building on this, we formulate a joint optimization framework for transmit beamforming and dynamic array partitioning to minimize the derived BCRBs for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. The optimization problem incorporates practical constraints, including multi-user communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements, transmit power budgets, and array partitioning feasibility conditions. To address the non-convexity of the problem, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm combining the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with semi-definite relaxation (SDR). We also design novel maximum a posteriori (MAP) DOA estimation algorithms specifically adapted to the statistical characteristics of each target model. Extensive simulations illustrate the superiority of the proposed dynamic partitioning strategy over conventional fixed-array architectures across diverse system configurations.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Characterization of Near-Field Beams with Uniform Linear Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider near-field beams that can mitigate signal attenuation and blockage effects using a uniform linear array (ULA). In particular, closed-form expressions for phase distributions in a ULA are derived to generate Bessel beams and curving beams based on the desired propagation directions and trajectories. Based on the phase distributions, the maximum steering angle and propagation distance of Bessel beams with a ULA are revealed. In addition, from the sampling theorem in the spatial domain, the requirements for ULAs to properly generate Bessel beams are clarified. For curving beams, trajectories to reach a user while avoiding one obstacle are designed via the Lagrangian method. Numerical results obtained by electromagnetic wave simulations confirm the effectiveness of the analyses for Bessel beams and the curving beam designs. Furthermore, the characteristics of Gaussian beams, beamfocusing, Bessel beams, and curving beams are summarized in terms of the statistical behavior of their intensity and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Joint ADS-B in B5G for Hierarchical UAV Networks: Performance Analysis and MEC Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play significant roles in multiple fields, which brings great challenges for the airspace safety. In order to achieve efficient surveillance and break the limitation of application scenarios caused by single communication, we propose the collaborative surveillance model for hierarchical UAVs based on the cooperation of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and 5G. Specifically, UAVs are hierarchical deployed, with the low-altitude central UAV equipped with the 5G module, and the high-altitude central UAV with ADS-B, which helps automatically broadcast the flight information to surrounding aircraft and ground stations. Firstly, we build the framework, derive the analytic expression, and analyze the channel performance of both air-to-ground (A2G) and air-to-air (A2A). Then, since the redundancy or information loss during transmission aggravates the monitoring performance, the mobile edge computing (MEC) based on-board processing algorithm is proposed. Finally, the performances of the proposed model and algorithm are verified through both simulations and experiments. In detail, the redundant data filtered out by the proposed algorithm accounts for 53.48%, and the supplementary data accounts for 16.42% of the optimized data. This work designs a UAV monitoring framework and proposes an algorithm to enhance the observability of trajectory surveillance, which helps improve the airspace safety and enhance the air traffic flow management.</description>

      <title>Multitaper-Based Post-Processing of Compact Antenna Responses Obtained in Non-Anechoic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of developing antenna structures typically involves prototype measurements. While accurate validation of far-field performance can be performed in dedicated facilities like anechoic chambers, high cost of construction and maintenance might not justify their use for teaching, or low-budget research scenarios. Non-anechoic experiments provide a cost-effective alternative, however the performance metrics obtained in such conditions require appropriate correction. In this paper, we consider a multitaper approach for post-processing antenna far-field characteristics measured in challenging, non-anechoic environments. The discussed algorithm enhances one-shot measurements to enable extraction of line-of-sight responses while attenuating interferences from multi-path propagation and the noise from external sources of electromagnetic radiation. The performance of the considered method has been demonstrated in uncontrolled conditions using a compact spline-based monopole. Furthermore, the approach has been favorably validated against the state-of-the-art techniques from the literature.</description>

      <title>SWIPT in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the integration of stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) into cell-free massive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) system to enhance the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) performance. Closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of the information-decoding receivers (IRs) and the average sum of harvested energy (sum-HE) at the energy-harvesting receivers (ERs) in the novel system model are derived to subsequently formulate a maximum total average sum-HE problem under a minimum SE threshold per each IR. This problem jointly optimizes the SIM phase-shift (PS) configuration and access points' (APs) power allocation, relying on long-term statistical channel state information (CSI). This non-convex problem is then transformed into more tractable forms. Then, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a layer-by-layer heuristic method for SIMs PS configuration that prioritizes sum-HE for the ERs and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based power allocation scheme to improve the achievable SE for the IRs. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve an almost 7-fold sum-HE gain as we increase the number of SIM layers, while the proposed power allocation (PPA) scheme often gains up to 40% in terms of the achievable minimum SE, compared to the equal power allocation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Joint Communications and Sensing Precoding Design: A Lyapunov Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a dynamic joint communications and sensing (JCAS) framework to adaptively design dedicated sensing and communications precoders. We first formulate a stochastic control problem to maximize the long-term average signal-to-noise ratio for sensing, subject to a minimum average communications signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirement and a power budget. Using Lyapunov optimization, specifically the drift-plus-penalty method, we cast the problem into a sequence of per-slot non-convex problems. To solve these problems, we develop a successive convex approximation method. Additionally, we derive a closed-form solution to the per-slot problems based on the notion of zero-forcing. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods and highlight their superiority compared to a baseline method based on conventional design.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Video-Haptic Radio Resource Slicing in Tactile Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling video-haptic radio resource slicing in the Tactile Internet requires a sophisticated strategy to meet the distinct requirements of video and haptic data, ensure their synchronized transmission, and address the stringent latency demands of haptic feedback. This paper introduces a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based radio resource slicing framework that addresses video-haptic teleoperation challenges by dynamically balancing radio resources between the video and haptic modalities. The proposed framework employs a refined reward function that considers latency, packet loss, data rate, and the synchronization requirements of both modalities to optimize resource allocation. By catering to the specific service requirements of video-haptic teleoperation, the proposed framework achieves up to a 25% increase in user satisfaction over existing methods, while maintaining effective resource slicing with execution intervals up to 50 ms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with modeling, analysis, and optimization of power amplifiers (PAs) placed in a cascaded structure, particularly the effect of cascaded nonlinearities is studied by showing potential ways to minimize the total nonlinearities. The nonlinear least-squares algorithm is proposed to optimize the PA parameters along with the input power level, and thereby minimize the total nonlinearities in the cascaded structure. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the optimized configurations for up to five PAs using the proposed framework can improve the linearity properties of the overall cascade.</description>

      <title>Cross-Environment Transfer Learning for Location-Aided Beam Prediction in 5G and Beyond Millimeter-Wave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications requirebeamforming and consequent precise beam alignmentbetween the gNodeB (gNB) and the user equipment (UE) toovercome high propagation losses. This beam alignment needs tobe constantly updated for different UE locations based on beamsweepingradio frequency measurements, leading to significantbeam management overhead. One potential solution involvesusing machine learning (ML) beam prediction algorithms thatleverage UE position information to select the serving beamwithout the overhead of beam sweeping. However, the highlysite-specific nature of mm-wave propagation means that MLmodels require training from scratch for each scenario, whichis inefficient in practice. In this paper, we propose a robustcross-environment transfer learning solution for location-aidedbeam prediction, whereby the ML model trained on a referencegNB is transferred to a target gNB by fine-tuning with a limiteddataset. Extensive simulation results based on ray-tracing in twourban environments show the effectiveness of our solution forboth inter- and intra-city model transfer. Our results show thatby training the model on a reference gNB and transferring themodel by fine-tuning with only 5% of the target gNB dataset,we can achieve 80% accuracy in predicting the best beamfor the target gNB. Importantly, our approach improves thepoor generalization accuracy of transferring the model to newenvironments without fine-tuning by around 75 percentage points.This demonstrates that transfer learning enables high predictionaccuracy while reducing the computational and training datasetcollection burden of ML-based beam prediction, making itpractical for 5G-and-beyond deployments.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Maximization: A Novel Method for SAR Image Formation from Raw Data without System Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging traditionally requires precise knowledge of system parameters to implement focusing algorithms that transform raw data into high-resolution images. These algorithms require knowledge of SAR system parameters, such as wavelength, center slant range, fast time sampling rate, pulse repetition interval (PRI), waveform parameters (e.g., frequency modulation rate), and platform speed. This paper presents a novel framework for recovering SAR images from raw data without the requirement of any SAR system parameters. Firstly, we introduce an approximate matched filtering model that leverages the inherent shift-invariance properties of SAR echoes, enabling image formation through an adaptive reference echo estimation. To estimate this unknown reference echo, we develop a principal component maximization (PCM) technique that exploits the low-dimensional structure of the SAR signal. The PCM method employs a three-stage procedure: 1) data block segmentation, 2) energy normalization, and 3) principal component energy maximization across blocks, effectively handling non-stationary clutter environments. Secondly, we present a range-varying azimuth reference signal estimation method that compensates for the quadratic phase errors. For cases where PRI is unknown, we propose a two-step PRI estimation scheme that enables robust reconstruction of 2-D images from 1-D data streams. Experimental results on various SAR datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively recover SAR images from raw data without any prior system parameters.</description>

      <title>Equiripple MIMO Beampattern Synthesis using Chebyshev Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a method for synthesizing equiripple MIMO transmit beampatterns using Chebyshev approximation. The MIMO beampattern is represented as a non-negative real-valued trigonometric polynomial where the $\ell^{\text{th}}$ order polynomial coefficient is the sum of the $\ell^{\text{th}}$ order diagonal of the waveform correlation matrix. The optimal coefficients for a given equiripple beampattern design is then posed as a Chebyshev approximation problem which is efficiently solved using the Parks-McClellan algorithm from optimal Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design theory. The unique advantage of this synthesis method is that it provides a closed form method to generating MIMO correlation matrices that realize the desired equiripple beampattern. This correspondingly facilitates the design of waveform sets that closely approximate those correlation matrices. This method is demonstrated via two illustrative design examples; the first using traditional partial signal correlation methods and the second using transmit beamspace processing. Both examples realize equiripple beampatterns using constant envelope and spectrally compact waveform sets.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Beam Prediction Using Far-Field Codebooks in Ultra-Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) technology is a key enabler for 6G networks, offering exceptional high data rates in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) frequency bands. The deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequencies transitions wireless communication into the radiative near-field, where precise beam alignment becomes essential for accurate channel estimation. Unlike far-field systems, which rely on angular domain only, near-field necessitates beam search across both angle and distance dimensions, leading to substantially higher training overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based beam alignment to mitigate the training overhead. We highlight that the reduced path loss at shorter distances can compensate for the beamforming losses typically associated with using far-field codebooks in near-field scenarios. Additionally, far-field beamforming in the near-field exhibits angular spread, with its width determined by the user's range and angle. Leveraging this relationship, we develop a correlation interferometry (CI) algorithm, termed CI-DFT, to efficiently estimate user angle and range parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves performance close to exhaustive search in terms of achievable rate while significantly reducing the training overhead by 87.5%.</description>

      <title>Unified Analysis of Decentralized Gradient Descent: a Contraction Mapping Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decentralized gradient descent (DGD) algorithm, and its sibling, diffusion, are workhorses in decentralized machine learning, distributed inference and estimation, and multi-agent coordination. We propose a novel, principled framework for the analysis of DGD and diffusion for strongly convex, smooth objectives, and arbitrary undirected topologies, using contraction mappings coupled with a result called the mean Hessian theorem (MHT). The use of these tools yields tight convergence bounds, both in the noise-free and noisy regimes. While these bounds are qualitatively similar to results found in the literature, our approach using contractions together with the MHT decouples the algorithm dynamics (how quickly the algorithm converges to its fixed point) from its asymptotic convergence properties (how far the fixed point is from the global optimum). This yields a simple, intuitive analysis that is accessible to a broader audience. Extensions are provided to multiple local gradient updates, time-varying step sizes, noisy gradients (stochastic DGD and diffusion), communication noise, and random topologies.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of IPTV: Challenges, Opportunities, and Future Trends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is a transformative approach to delivering audio and video services through high-speed Internet networks, enabling direct access to television content via home computers or set-top boxes. Despite its promising advantages, including flexibility, interactivity, and bundled services such as triple play (voice, Internet, and TV) and quadruple play (adding mobile services), IPTV is still in its development phase. Key challenges include achieving a Quality of Service (QoS) comparable to traditional broadcasters, addressing limited bandwidth, and overcoming a lack of standardization among service providers.
  This paper explores the technical, operational, and consumer-oriented aspects of IPTV. It discusses data compression techniques, protocols like IGMP and RTSP, and the role of advanced codecs like H.264 in ensuring efficient data transmission. The study also examines the distinctions between IPTV and open-network Internet TV, the importance of security and privacy, and the emergence of new business opportunities through targeted advertising and interactive services. Although IPTV is unlikely to completely replace traditional broadcasting, it is poised to play an important role in shaping the future of television by offering personalized, secure, and scalable viewing experiences.</description>

      <title>SCAN-BEST: Efficient Sub-6GHz-Aided Near-field Beam Selection with Formal Reliability Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems continue to incorporate larger antenna arrays, the range of near-field propagation expands, making it more likely for users close to the transmitter to fall within the near-field regime. Traditional far-field beam training methods are no longer effective in this context. Additionally, near-field beam training presents challenges, since the training codebook must account for both angular and distance dimensions, leading to large codebook sizes. To reduce the in-band training overhead, we propose the Sub-6G Channel-Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework, which is motivated by the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels. SCAN-BEST utilizes preprocessed sub-6G channel estimates as input, and employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the probability of each beam being optimal within the near-field beam training codebook. Given the prediction uncertainty arising from the variance between sub-6G and mmWave channels, we introduce a conformal risk control (CRC)-based module that generates a set of beam candidates for further limited in-band training, enabling the final beam selection to formally meet user-defined target coverage rate. Numerical results confirm the thereoretical properties of SCAN-BEST in terms of the achieved coverage rate of the beam candidates and various metrics. Moreover, SCAN-BEST enjoys good scalability and robustness to various sub-6G system configurations, including to the sizes of calibration datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Self-Supervised Semantic Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as a promising paradigm that focuses on the extraction and transmission of semantic meanings using deep learning techniques. While current research primarily addresses the reduction of semantic communication overhead, it often overlooks the training phase, which can incur significant communication costs in dynamic wireless environments. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal semantic communication system that leverages multi-modal self-supervised learning to enhance task-agnostic feature extraction. The proposed approach employs self-supervised learning during the pre-training phase to extract task-agnostic semantic features, followed by supervised fine-tuning for downstream tasks. This dual-phase strategy effectively captures both modality-invariant and modality-specific features while minimizing training-related communication overhead. Experimental results on the NYU Depth V2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces training-related communication overhead while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing supervised learning approaches. The findings underscore the advantages of multi-modal self-supervised learning in semantic communication, paving the way for more efficient and scalable edge inference systems.</description>

      <title>Room Impulse Response Estimation through Optimal Mass Transport Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of jointly estimating a set of room impulse responses (RIRs) corresponding to closely spaced microphones. The accurate estimation of RIRs is crucial in acoustic applications such as speech enhancement, noise cancellation, and auralization. However, real-world constraints such as short excitation signals, low signal-to-noise ratios, and poor spectral excitation, often render the estimation problem ill-posed. In this paper, we address these challenges by means of optimal mass transport (OMT) regularization. In particular, we propose to use an OMT barycenter, or generalized mean, as a mechanism for information sharing between the microphones. This allows us to quantify and exploit similarities in the delay-structures between the different microphones without having to impose rigid assumptions on the room acoustics. The resulting estimator is formulated in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem which can be implemented using standard solvers. In numerical examples, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in addressing otherwise ill-conditioned estimation scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-Frequency (RF) imaging concerns the digital recreation of the surfaces of scene objects based on the scattered field at distributed receivers. To solve this difficult inverse scattering problems, data-driven methods are often employed that extract patterns from similar training examples, while offering minimal latency. In this paper, we first provide an approximate yet fast electromagnetic model, which is based on the electric field integral equations, for data generation, and subsequently propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture to learn the corresponding inverse model. A graph-attention backbone allows for the system geometry to be passed to the DNN, where residual convolutional layers extract features about the objects, while a UNet head performs the final image reconstruction. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two synthetic data sets of different characteristics showcase the performance gains of thee proposed advanced architecture and its relative resilience to signal noise levels and various reception configurations.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a beam switching smart antenna array for use in traffic telematics V2X applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the digitalization of transportation new use cases for digital information services are emerging. For example, prioritization of road users at traffic signals, especially emergency vehicles, is a desired goal. Requirements for the necessary communication link between road user and C-ITS station are often inadequately met. In particular, increasing communication distances while minimizing latencies are key requirements for timely influencing the control of traffic light signal programs. This paper presents the automotive application of a fast-switchable antenna array with targeted transmission direction selection and high antenna gain. In addition to antenna design requirements, theoretical analyses to increase transmission distance are performed using radio propagation simulation. Furthermore, practical evaluation is performed both in laboratory and test field environment using continuous wave and C-ITS service measurements. An automatic switching of antenna sectors based on geolocation is implemented and discussed from a scientific point of view. As a result, using an adaptive antenna array in traffic telematics environments is proposed to provide more robust communication links and increase the radio transmission distance.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Spatial and Temporal Correlations in Massive MIMO Systems Over Non-Stationary Aging Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates a multi-user, multi-antenna uplink wireless system, where multiple users transmit signals to a base station. Previous research has explored the potential for linear growth in spectral efficiency by employing multiple transmit and receive antennas. This gain depends on the quality of channel state information and uncorrelated antennas. However, spatial correlations, arising from closely-spaced antennas, and channel aging effects, stemming from the difference between the channel at pilot and data time instances, can substantially counteract these benefits and degrade the transmission rate, especially in non-stationary environments. To address these challenges, this work introduces a real-time beamforming framework to compensate for the spatial correlation effect. A channel estimation scheme is then developed, leveraging temporal channel correlations and considering mobile device velocity and antenna spacing. Subsequently, an expression approximating the average spectral efficiency is obtained, dependent on pilot spacing, pilot and data powers, and beamforming vectors. By maximizing this expression, optimal parameters are identified. Numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to prior works. Moreover, optimal pilot spacing remains unaffected by interference components such as path loss and the velocity of interference users. The impact of interference components also diminishes with an increasing number of transmit antennas.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Enhanced Wideband Multi-User CSI Learning With LiDAR Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been utilized for optimizing wireless communications due to its ability to detect the environment. This paper explores the use of LiDAR in channel estimation for wideband multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems and introduces a LiDAR-enhanced Channel State Information (CSI) learning network (LE-CLN). By utilizing user positioning information, LE-CLN first calculates user-localized over-complete angular measurements. It then investigates the correlation between LiDAR and CSI, transforming raw LiDAR data into a low-complexity format embedded with signal propagation characteristics. LE-CLN also adapts the use of LiDAR based on channel conditions through attention mechanisms. Thanks to the unique wireless features offered by LiDAR, LE-CLN achieves higher estimation accuracy and spectrum efficiency compared to benchmarks, particularly in latency-sensitive applications where pilot transmissions are expected to be reduced.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of HAPS-RIS on UAV-Based Networks: a Novel Network Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a network architecture where two types of aerial infrastructures together with a ground station provide connectivity to a remote area. A high altitude platform station (HAPS) is equipped with reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, to be exploited to assist the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based wireless networks. A key challenge in such networks is the restricted number of UAVs, which limits full coverage and leaves some users unsupported. To tackle this issue, we propose a hierarchical bilevel optimization framework including a leader and a follower problem. The users served by HAPS-RIS are in a zone called HAPS-RIS zone and the users served by the UAVs are in another zone called UAV zone. In the leader problem, the goal is to establish the zone boundary and practical RIS phase shift design that maximizes the number of users covered by HAPS-RIS while ensuring that users in this zone meet their rate requirements. This is achieved through our proposed relaxation method and algorithm based on the RIS clustering concept. The follower problem focuses on minimizing the number of UAVs required, ensuring that the rate requirements of the users in the UAV zone are met. This is addressed through our proposed dynamic method adopting k-means clustering technique with adaptive UAV selection. Our study reveals that increasing the number of RIS elements significantly decreases the number of required UAVs.</description>

      <title>Deep Adversarial Learning with Activity-Based User Discrimination Task for Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new adversarial deep learning framework for the problem of human activity recognition (HAR) using inertial sensors worn by people. Our framework incorporates a novel adversarial activity-based discrimination task that addresses inter-person variability-i.e., the fact that different people perform the same activity in different ways. Overall, our proposed framework outperforms previous approaches on three HAR datasets using a leave-one-(person)-out cross-validation (LOOCV) benchmark. Additional results demonstrate that our discrimination task yields better classification results compared to previous tasks within the same adversarial framework.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Power Allocation for Massive MIMO ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is envisioned as a key feature in future wireless communications networks. Its integration with massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques promises to leverage substantial spatial beamforming gains for both functionalities. In this work, we consider a massive MIMO-ISAC system employing a uniform planar array with zero-forcing and maximum-ratio downlink transmission schemes combined with monostatic radar-type sensing. Our focus lies on deriving closed-form expressions for the achievable communications rate and the Cram\'er--Rao lower bound (CRLB), which serve as performance metrics for communications and sensing operations, respectively. The expressions enable us to investigate important operational characteristics of massive MIMO-ISAC, including the mutual effects of communications and sensing as well as the advantages stemming from using a very large antenna array for each functionality. Furthermore, we devise a power allocation strategy based on successive convex approximation to maximize the communications rate while guaranteeing the CRLB constraints and transmit power budget. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed power allocation approach.</description>

      <title>Conformal Lyapunov Optimization: Optimal Resource Allocation under Deterministic Reliability Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00486v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource allocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term objectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints. Unlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource allocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal worst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by integrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk control (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The effectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference targeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture. Specifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability constraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation decisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and imprecision, with the latter accounting for the rate of false positives.</description>

      <title>CATD: Unified Representation Learning for EEG-to-fMRI Cross-Modal Generation</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal neuroimaging analysis is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of brain function and pathology, as it allows for the integration of different imaging techniques, thus overcoming the limitations of individual modalities. However, the high costs and limited availability of certain modalities pose significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposed the Condition-Aligned Temporal Diffusion (CATD) framework for end-to-end cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging, enabling the generation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-detected Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals from more accessible Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. By constructing Conditionally Aligned Block (CAB), heterogeneous neuroimages are aligned into a potential space, achieving a unified representation that provides the foundation for cross-modal transformation in neuroimaging. The combination with the constructed Dynamic Time-Frequency Segmentation (DTFS) module also enables the use of EEG signals to improve the temporal resolution of BOLD signals, thus augmenting the capture of the dynamic details of the brain. Experimental validation demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework in improving the accuracy of neural activity prediction, identifying abnormal brain regions, and enhancing the temporal resolution of BOLD signals. The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging by unifying heterogeneous neuroimaging data into a potential representation space, showing promise in medical applications such as improving Parkinson's disease prediction and identifying abnormal brain regions.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Inference with On-Device Small and Remote Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.</description>

      <title>Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC Waveform Design Based on Frequency-Domain Phase Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design is a crucial issue in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper introduces an OFDM-ISAC waveform design that utilizes the entire spectrum simultaneously for both communication and sensing by leveraging a novel degree of freedom (DoF): the frequency-domain phase difference (PD). Based on this concept, we develop a novel PD-based OFDM-ISAC waveform structure and utilize it to design a PD-based Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC (PLPOI) waveform. The design is formulated as an optimization problem incorporating four key constraints: the time-frequency relationship equation, frequency-domain unimodular constraints, PD constraints, and time-domain low PAPR requirements. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm, ADMM-PLPOI, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PLPOI waveform achieves significant improvements in both PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OFDM-ISAC waveforms.</description>
