      <title>An adaptive perfectly matched layer finite element method for acoustic-elastic interaction in periodic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the scattering of a time-harmonic acoustic plane wave by an elastic body with an unbounded periodic surface. The original problem can be confined to the analysis of the fields in one periodic cell. With the help of the perfectly matched layer (PML) technique, we can truncate the unbounded physical domain into a bounded computational domain. By respectively constructing the equivalent transparent boundary conditions of acoustic and elastic waves simultaneously, the well-posedness and exponential convergence of the solution to the associated truncated PML problem are established. The finite element method is applied to solve the PML problem of acoustic-elastic interaction. To address the singularity caused by the non-smooth surface of the elastic body, we establish a residual-type a posteriori error estimate and develop an adaptive PML finite element algorithm. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive algorithm.</description>

      <title>SVD-Preconditioned Gradient Descent Method for Solving Nonlinear Least Squares Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm designed for nonlinear least-squares problems. The method is derived by preconditioning the gradient descent direction using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the Jacobian. This SVD-based preconditioner is then integrated with the first- and second-moment adaptive learning rate mechanism of the Adam optimizer. We establish the local linear convergence of the proposed method under standard regularity assumptions and prove global convergence for a modified version of the algorithm under suitable conditions. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated experimentally across a range of tasks, including function approximation, partial differential equation (PDE) solving, and image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms standard Adam, achieving faster convergence and lower error in both regression and classification settings.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian ADER-DG methods on classical and degenerate spacetime geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a thorough von Neumann stability analysis of explicit and implicit Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods on classical and degenerate spacetime geometries for hyperbolic equations. First, we rigorously study the CFL stability conditions for the explicit ADER-DG method, confirming results widely used in the literature while specifying their limitations. Moreover, we highlight under which conditions on the mesh velocity the ALE methods, constrained to a given CFL, are actually stable. Next, we extend the stability study to ADER-DG in the presence of degenerate spacetime elements, with zero size at the beginning and the end of the time step, but with a non zero spacetime volume. This kind of elements has been introduced in a series of articles on direct ALE methods by Gaburro et al. to connect via spacetime control volumes regenerated Voronoi tessellations after a topology change. Here, we imitate this behavior in 1d by fictitiously inserting degenerate elements in between two cells. Then, we show that over this degenerate spacetime geometry, both for the explicit and implicit ADER-DG, the CFL stability constraints remain the same as those for classical geometries, laying the theoretical foundations for their use in the context of ALE methods.</description>

      <title>Boundary elements for clamped Kirchhoff--Love plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Galerkin boundary element method for clamped Kirchhoff--Love plates with piecewise smooth boundary. It is a direct method based on the representation formula and requires the inversion of the single-layer operator and an application of the double-layer operator to the Dirichlet data. We present trace approximation spaces of arbitrary order, required for both the Dirichlet data and the unknown Neumann trace. Our boundary element method is quasi-optimal with respect to the natural trace norm
  and achieves optimal convergence order under minimal regularity assumptions. We provide explicit representations of both boundary integral operators and discuss the implementation of the appearing integrals. Numerical experiments for smooth and non-smooth domains confirm predicted convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Interpolating between Tikhonov regularization and spectral cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularizing a linear ill-posed operator equation can be achieved by manipulating the spectrum of the operator's pseudo-inverse. Tikhonov regularization and spectral cutoff are well-known techniques within this category. This paper introduces an interpolating formula that defines a one-parameter family of regularizations, where Tikhonov and spectral cutoff methods are represented as limiting cases. By adjusting the interpolating parameter taking into account the specific operator equation under consideration, it is possible to mitigate the limitations associated with both Tikhonov and spectral cutoff regularizations. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations in the fields of signal and image processing.</description>

      <title>Tensor CUR Decomposition under the Linear-Map-Based Tensor-Tensor Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The factorization of three-dimensional data continues to gain attention due to its relevance in representing and compressing large-scale datasets. The linear-map-based tensor-tensor multiplication is a matrix-mimetic operation that extends the notion of matrix multiplication to higher order tensors, and which is a generalization of the T-product. Under this framework, we introduce the tensor CUR decomposition, show its performance in video foreground-background separation for different linear maps and compare it to a robust matrix CUR decomposition, another tensor approximation and the slice-based singular value decomposition (SS-SVD). We also provide a theoretical analysis of our tensor CUR decomposition, extending classical matrix results to establish exactness conditions and perturbation bounds.</description>

      <title>A Reynolds- and Hartmann-semirobust hybrid method for magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a new method for the unsteady incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations on convex domains with hybrid approximations of both vector-valued and scalar-valued fields. The proposed method is convection-semirobust, meaning that, for sufficiently smooth solutions, one can derive a priori estimates for the velocity and the magnetic field that do not depend on the inverse of the diffusion coefficients. This is achieved while at the same time providing relevant additional features, namely an improved order of convergence for the (asymptotic) diffusion-dominated regime, a small stencil (owing to the absence of inter-element penalty terms), and the possibility to significantly reduce the size of the algebraic problems through static condensation. The theoretical results are confirmed by a complete panel of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>LDG method for solving spatial and temporal fractional nonlinear convection-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a nonlinear convection-diffusion equation with space and time-fractional Laplacian operators of orders $1&lt;\beta&lt;2$ and $0&lt;\alpha\leq1$, respectively. We develop local discontinuous Galerkin methods, including Legendre basis functions, for a solution to this class of fractional diffusion problem, and prove stability and optimal order of convergence $O(h^{k+1}+(\Delta t)^{1+\frac{p}{2}}+p^2)$. This technique turns the equation into a system of first-order equations and approximates the solution by selecting the appropriate basis functions. Regarding accuracy and stability, the basis functions greatly improve the method. According to the numerical results, the proposed scheme performs efficiently and accurately in various conditions and meets the optimal order of convergence.</description>

      <title>Beyond Free-Stream Preservation: Transport Polynomial Exactness for Moving-Mesh Methods under Arbitrary Mesh Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order moving-mesh methods can effectively reduce numerical diffusion, but their formal accuracy typically relies on the regularity of the mesh velocity. This dependency creates a fundamental conflict in the numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws, where solution-driven adaptation may induce nonsmooth mesh motion, thereby degrading convergence order. We introduce \emph{transport polynomial exactness} (TPE($k$)), a mesh-motion-independent criterion that generalizes classical free-stream preservation (TPE(0)) to the exact advection of degree-$k$ polynomials. We show that the classical geometric conservation law (GCL) is insufficient to ensure TPE($k$) for $k \ge 1$ due to mismatches in higher-order geometric moments. To resolve this, we propose \emph{evolved geometric moments} (EGMs), obtained by solving auxiliary transport equations discretized compatibly with the physical variables. We rigorously prove that second-degree EGMs evolved via the third-order strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta (SSPRK3) method coincide with the exact geometric moments. This exactness arises from a \emph{superconvergence} mechanism wherein SSPRK3 reduces to Simpson's rule for EGM evolution. Leveraging this result, we construct a third-order conservative finite-volume rezoning moving-mesh scheme. The scheme satisfies the TPE(2) property for \emph{arbitrary mesh motion} and \emph{any pseudo-time step size}, thereby naturally accommodating spatiotemporally discontinuous mesh velocity. Crucially, this \emph{breaks the efficiency bottleneck} in the conventional advection-based remapping step and reduces the required pseudo-time levels from $\mathcal{O}(h^{-1})$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ under bounded but discontinuous mesh velocity. Numerical experiments verify exact quadratic transport and stable third-order convergence under extreme mesh deformation, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error distribution for tamed Euler method with coupled monotonicity condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the asymptotic error distribution of the tamed Euler method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a coupled monotonicity condition, that is, the limit distribution of the corresponding normalized error process. Specifically, for SDEs driven by multiplicative noise, we first propose a tamed Euler method parameterized by $\alpha\in (0, 1]$ and establish that its strong convergence rate is $\alpha\wedge\frac{1}{2}$. Notably, $\alpha $ can take arbitrary positive values by adjusting the regularization coefficient without altering the strong convergence rate. We then derive the asymptotic error distribution for this tamed Euler method. Further, we infer from the limit equation that among the tamed Euler method of strong order $\frac{1}{2}$, the one with $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$ yields the largest mean-square error after a long time, while those of $\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{2}$ share a unified asymptotic error distribution. In addition, our analysis is also extended to SDEs with additive noise and similar conclusions are obtained. Additional treatments are required to accommodate super-linearly growing coefficients, a feature that distinguishes our analysis on the asymptotic error distribution from established results.</description>

      <title>Fixed-grid sharp-interface numerical solutions to the three-phase spherical Stefan problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many metal manufacturing processes involve phase change phenomena, which include melting, boiling, and vaporization. These phenomena often occur concurrently. A prototypical 1D model for understanding the phase change phenomena is the Stefan problem. There is a large body of literature discussing the analytical solution to the two-phase Stefan problem that describes only the melting or boiling of phase change materials (PCMs) with one moving interface. Density-change effects that induce additional fluid flow during phase change are generally neglected in the literature to simplify the math of the Stefan problem. In our recent work [1], we provide analytical and numerical solutions to the three-phase Stefan problem with simultaneous occurrences of melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation in Cartesian coordinates. Our current work builds on our previous work to solve a more challenging problem: the three-phase Stefan problem in spherical coordinates for finite-sized particles. There are three moving interfaces in this system: the melt front, the boiling front, and the outer boundary which is in contact with the atmosphere. Although an analytical solution could not be found for this problem, we solved the governing equations using a fixed-grid sharp-interface method with second-order spatio-temporal accuracy. Using a small-time analytical solution, we predict a reasonably accurate estimate of temperature (in the three phases) and interface positions and velocities at the start of the simulation. Our numerical method is validated by reproducing the two-phase nanoparticle melting results of Font et al. [2]. Lastly, we solve the three-phase Stefan problems numerically to demonstrate the importance of kinetic energy terms during phase change of smaller (nano) particles. In contrast, these effects diminish for large particles (microns and larger).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an accelerated continuous-time formulation of Adam by modeling it as a second-order integro-differential dynamical system. We relate this inertial nonlocal model to an existing first-order nonlocal Adam flow through an $\alpha$-refinement limit, and we provide Lyapunov-based stability and convergence analyses. We also introduce an Adam-inspired nonlocal Lagrangian formulation, offering a variational viewpoint. Numerical simulations on Rosenbrock-type examples show agreement between the proposed dynamics and discrete Adam.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Physics-Informed Consistency Models via Structure-Preserving Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed consistency modeling framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) via fast, few-step generative inference. We identify a key stability challenge in physics-constrained consistency training, where PDE residuals can drive the model toward trivial or degenerate solutions, degrading the learned data distribution. To address this, we introduce a structure-preserving two-stage training strategy that decouples distribution learning from physics enforcement by freezing the coefficient decoder during physics-informed fine-tuning. We further propose a two-step residual objective that enforces physical consistency on refined, structurally valid generative trajectories rather than noisy single-step predictions. The resulting framework enables stable, high-fidelity inference for both unconditional generation and forward problems. We demonstrate that forward solutions can be obtained via a projection-based zero-shot inpainting procedure, achieving consistent accuracy of diffusion baselines with orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost.</description>

      <title>Stability and Concentration in Nonlinear Inverse Problems with Block-Structured Parameters: Lipschitz Geometry, Identifiability, and an Application to Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for stability and statistical concentration in nonlinear inverse problems with block-structured parameters. Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability. This leads to a fundamental stability--resolution tradeoff, showing that estimation error is inherently constrained by the ratio between image resolution and model complexity. Overall, the analysis characterizes operator-level limits for a broad class of high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problems arising in modern imaging and differentiable rendering.</description>

      <title>Adaptive recurrent flow map operator learning for reaction diffusion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion (RD) equations underpin pattern formation across chemistry, biology, and physics, yet learning stable operators that forecast their long-term dynamics from data remains challenging. Neural-operator surrogates provide resolution-robust prediction, but autoregressive rollouts can drift due to the accumulation of error, and out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions often degrade accuracy. Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems. Across these benchmarks, DDOL-ART delivers a strong accuracy and cost trade-off. It is several-fold faster than a physics-based numerical-loss operator learner (NLOL) under matched settings, and it remains competitive on both in-distribution stability and OOD robustness. Training-dynamics diagnostics show that adaptivity strengthens the correlation between validation error and OOD test error performance, acting as a feedback controller that limits optimization drift. Our results indicate that feedback-controlled recurrent training of DDOL-ART generates robust flow-map surrogates without PDE residuals, while simultaneously maintaining competitiveness with NLOL at significantly reduced training costs.</description>

      <title>Learning to Discover Iterative Spectral Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AutoSpec, a neural network framework for discovering iterative spectral algorithms for large-scale numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization. Our self-supervised models adapt to input operators using coarse spectral information (e.g., eigenvalue estimates and residual norms), and they predict recurrence coefficients for computing or applying a matrix polynomial tailored to a downstream task. The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines. We also find clear connections to classical theory: the induced polynomials often exhibit near-equiripple, near-minimax behavior characteristic of Chebyshev polynomials.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed diffusion models in spectral space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a methodology that combines generative latent diffusion models with physics-informed machine learning to generate solutions of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) conditioned on partial observations, which includes, in particular, forward and inverse PDE problems. We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

      <title>Allure of Craquelure: A Variational-Generative Approach to Crack Detection in Paintings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in imaging technologies, deep learning and numerical performance have enabled non-invasive detailed analysis of artworks, supporting their documentation and conservation. In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of the Gaussian kernel matrix for partially noisy data in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian kernel is one of the most important kernels, applicable to many research fields, including scientific computing and data science. In this paper, we present asymptotic analysis of the Gaussian kernel matrix in high dimension under a statistical model of noisy data. The main result is a nice combination of Karoui's asymptotic analysis with procedures of constrained low rank matrix approximations. More specifically, Karouli clarified an important asymptotic structure of the Gaussian kernel matrix, leading to strong consistency of the eigenvectors, though the eigenvalues are inconsistent. This paper focuses on the above results and presents a consistent estimator with the use of the smallest eigenvalue, whenever the target kernel matrix tends to low rank in the asymptotic regime. Importantly, asymptotic analysis is given under a statistical model representing partial noise. Although a naive estimator is inconsistent, applying an optimization method for low rank approximations with constraints, we overcome the difficulty caused by the inconsistency, resulting in a new estimator with strong consistency in rank deficient cases.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz Based Spectral Methods for Data-driven Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Toeplitz-based framework for data-driven spectral estimation of linear evolution operators in dynamical systems. Focusing on transfer and Koopman operators from equilibrium trajectories without access to the underlying equations of motion, our method applies Toeplitz filters to the infinitesimal generator to extract eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and spectral measures. Structural prior knowledge, such as self-adjointness or skew-symmetry, can be incorporated by design. The approach is statistically consistent and computationally efficient, leveraging both primal and dual algorithms commonly used in statistical learning. Numerical experiments on deterministic and chaotic systems demonstrate that the framework can recover spectral properties beyond the reach of standard data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Multiple Polylogarithms with Arbitrary Arguments in \textsc{GiNaC}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the numerical evaluation of elliptic multiple polylogarithms for arbitrary arguments and to arbitrary precision. The cornerstone of our approach is a procedure to obtain a convergent $q$-series representation of elliptic multiple polylogarithms. Its coefficients are expressed in terms of ordinary multiple polylogarithms, which can be evaluated efficiently using existing libraries. In a series of preparation steps the elliptic polylogarithms are mapped into a region where the $q$-series converges rapidly. We also present an implementation of our algorithm into the \texttt{GiNaC} framework. This release constitutes the first public package capable of evaluating elliptic multiple polylogarithms to high precision and for arbitrary values of the arguments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing new optimal explicit and implicit Adams-type difference formulas for finding an approximate solution to the Cauchy problem for an ordinary differential equation in a Hilbert space. In this work, I minimize the norm of the error functional of the difference formula with respect to the coefficients, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the coefficients of the difference formulas. This system of equations is reduced to a system of equations in convolution and the system of equations is completely solved using a discrete analog of a differential operator $d^2/dx^2-1$. Here we present an algorithm for constructing optimal explicit and implicit difference formulas in a specific Hilbert space. In addition, comparing the Euler method with optimal explicit and implicit difference formulas, numerical experiments are given. Experiments show that the optimal formulas give a good approximation compared to the Euler method.</description>

      <title>Finite Difference Approximation with ADI Scheme for Two-dimensional Keller-Segel Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keller-Segel systems are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations used to model chemotaxis in biology. In this paper, we propose two alternating direction implicit (ADI) schemes to solve the 2D Keller-Segel systems directly with minimal computational cost, while preserving positivity, energy dissipation law and mass conservation. One scheme unconditionally preserves positivity, while the other does so conditionally. Both schemes achieve second-order accuracy in space, with the former being first-order accuracy in time and the latter second-order accuracy in time. Besides, the former scheme preserves the energy dissipation law asymptotically. We validate these results through numerical experiments, and also compare the efficiency of our schemes with the standard five-point scheme, demonstrating that our approaches effectively reduce computational costs.</description>

      <title>Convergence Properties of Nonlinear GMRES Applied to Linear Systems</title>

Abstract: The Nonlinear GMRES (NGMRES) proposed by Washio and Oosterlee [Electron. Trans. Numer. Anal, 6(271-290), 1997] is an acceleration method for fixed point iterations. It has been demonstrated to be effective, but its convergence properties have not been extensively studied in the literature so far. In this work we aim to close some of this gap, by offering a convergence analysis for NGMRES applied to linear systems. A central part of our analysis focuses on identifying equivalences between NGMRES and the classical Krylov subspace GMRES method.</description>

      <title>A median QMC method for unbounded integrands over $\mathbb{R}^{s}$ in weighted unanchored Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration of Lebesgue integrable functions with respect to a density function over $\mathbb{R}^s$. We extend the construction-free median QMC rule proposed by Goda and L'ecuyer (SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2022) to the weighted unanchored Sobolev space of functions defined over $\mathbb{R}^s$ introduced by Nichols and Kuo (J. Complexity, 2014). By taking the median of $k = \mathcal{O}(\log N)$ independent randomized QMC estimators, we prove that for any $\epsilon\in (0,r-\frac{1}{2}]$, our method achieves a mean absolute error bound of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-r+\epsilon})$, where $N$ is the number of points and $r&gt;\frac{1}{2}$ is a parameter determined by the function space. This rate matches the rate of randomly shifted lattice rules obtained via a component-by-component (CBC) construction, while our approach requires no specific CBC constructions or prior knowledge of the space's weight structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method attains an accuracy comparable to the CBC construction based method, and outperforms the Monte Carlo method.</description>

Abstract: This articles investigates physics-based passive imaging problem, wherein one infers an unknown medium using ambient noise and correlation of the noise signal. We develop a general backpropagation framework via the so-called extended adjoint state, suitable for any elliptic PDE; crucially, this approach reduces by half the number of required PDE solves. Applications to several different PDE models demonstrate the universality of our method. In addition, we analyze the nonlinearity of the correlated model, revealing a surprising tangential cone condition-like structure, thereby advancing the state of the art towards a convergence guarantee for regularized reconstruction in passive imaging.</description>

      <title>Monolithic and Block Overlapping Schwarz Preconditioners for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolithic preconditioners applied to the linear systems arising during the solution of the discretized incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are typically more robust than preconditioners based on incomplete block factorizations. Lower number of iterations and a reduced sensitivity to parameters like velocity and viscosity can significantly outweigh the additional cost for their setup. Different monolithic preconditioning techniques are introduced and compared to a selection of block preconditioners. In particular, two-level additive overlapping Schwarz methods (OSM) are used to set up monolithic preconditioners and to approximate the inverses arising in the block preconditioners. GDSW-type (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) coarse spaces are used for the second level. These highly scalable, parallel preconditioners have been implemented in the solver framework FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz), which is part of the software library Trilinos. The new GDSW-type coarse space GDSW* is introduced; combining it with other techniques results in a robust algorithm. The block preconditioners PCD (Pressure Convection-Diffusion), SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations), and LSC (Least-Squares Commutator) are considered to various degrees. The OSM for the monolithic as well as the block approach allows the optimized combination of different coarse spaces for the velocity and pressure components, enabling the use of tailored coarse spaces. The numerical and parallel performance of the different preconditioning methods for finite element discretizations of stationary as well as time-dependent incompressible fluid flow problems is investigated and compared. Their robustness is analyzed for a range of Reynolds and Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers with respect to a realistic problem setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply mixed-precision to the low-rank Lyapunov ADI (LR-ADI) by performing certain aspects of the algorithm in a lower working precision. Namely, we accumulate the overall solution, solve the linear systems comprising the ADI iteration, and store the inner low-rank factors of the residuals in various combinations of IEEE 754 single and double precision. We empirically test our implementation on Lyapunov equations arising from first- and second-order descriptor systems. For the first-order examples, accumulating the solution in single-precision yields an almost-as-small residual as for the double-precision solution. For certain applications, like computing the H2 norm of a descriptor system, low- or mixed-precision variants of the ADI can be quite competitive</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze in a unified setting two schemes for the numerical discretization of a Darcy-Forchheimer fluid flow model coupled with an advection-diffusion equation modeling the temperature distribution in the fluid. The first approach is based on fully discontinuous Galerkin discretization spaces. In contrast, in the second approach, the velocity is approximated in the Raviart-Thomas space, and the pressure and temperature are still piecewise discontinuous. A fixed-point linearization strategy, naturally inducing an iterative splitting solution, is proposed for treating the nonlinearities of the problem. We present a unified stability analysis and prove the convergence of the iterative algorithm under mild requirements on the problem data. A wide set of two- and three-dimensional simulations is presented to assess the error decay and demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed approaches in physically sound test cases.</description>

Abstract: Systems of N = 1, 2, . . . first-order hyperbolic conservation laws feature N undamped waves propagating at finite speeds. On their own hand, multi-step Finite Difference and lattice Boltzmann schemes with q = N + 1, N + 2, . . . unknowns involve N ''physical'' waves, which are aimed at being as closely-looking as possible to the ones of the PDEs, and q-N ''numerical-spurious-parasitic'' waves, which are subject to their own speed of propagation, and either damped or undamped. The whole picture is even more complicated in the discrete setting-as numerical schemes act as dispersive media, thus propagate different harmonics at different phase (and group) velocities. For compelling practical reasons, simulations must always be conducted on bounded domains, even when the target problem is unbounded in space. The importance of transparent boundary conditions, preventing artificial boundaries from acting as mirrors producing polluting ricochets, naturally follows. This work presents, building on Besse, Coulombel, and Noble [ESAIM: M2AN, 55 (2021)], a systematic way of developing perfectly transparent boundary conditions for lattice Boltzmann schemes tackling linear problems in one and two space dimensions. Our boundary conditions are ''perfectly'' transparent, at least for 1D problems, as they absorb both physical and spurious waves regardless of their frequency. After presenting, in a simple framework, several approaches to handle the fact that q &gt; N , we elect the so-called ''scalar'' approach (which despite its name, also works when N &gt; 1) as method of choice for more involved problems. This method solely relies on computing the coefficients of the Laurent series at infinity of the roots of the dispersion relation of the bulk scheme. We insist on asymptotics for these coefficients in the spirit of analytic combinatorics. The reason is two-fold: asymptotics guide truncation of boundary conditions to make them depending on a fixed number of past time-steps, and make it clearduring the process of computing coefficients-whether intermediate quantities can be safely stored using floating-point arithmetic or not. Numerous numerical investigations in 1D and 2D with N = 1 and 2 are carried out, and show the effectiveness of the proposed boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: This work presents problems of constructing finite-difference formulas in the Hilbert space, i.e., setting problems of constructing finite-difference formulas using functional methods. The work presents a functional statement of the problem of optimizing finite-difference formulas in the space $W_{2}^{\left(m,m-1\right)} \left(0,1\right)$. Here, representations of optimal coefficients of explicit finite-difference formulas of the Adams type on classes $W_{2}^{\left(m,m-1\right)} \left(0,1\right)$ for any $m\ge 3$ will be found.</description>

      <title>BDF2-type integrator for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in micromagnetics: unconditional weak convergence to weak solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLG) that models time-dependent micromagnetic phenomena. We propose a full discretization that employs first-order finite elements in space and a BDF2-type two-step method in time. In each time step, only one linear system of equations has to be solved. We employ linear interpolation in time to reconstruct the discrete space-time magnetization. We prove that the integrator is unconditionally stable and thus guarantees that a subsequence of the reconstructed magnetization converges weakly in $H^1$ towards a weak solution of LLG in the space-time domain. Numerical experiments verify that the proposed integrator is indeed first-order in space and second-order in time.</description>

      <title>A fast stochastic interacting particle-field method for 3D parabolic parabolic Chemotaxis systems: numerical algorithms and error analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel numerical framework, namely the stochastic interacting particle-field method with particle-in-cell acceleration (SIPF-PIC), for the efficient simulation of the three-dimensional (3D) parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel (KS) systems. The SIPF-PIC method integrates Lagrangian particle dynamics with spectral field solvers by leveraging localized particle-grid interpolations and fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques. For $P$ particles and $H$ Fourier modes per spatial dimension, the SIPF-PIC method achieves a computational complexity of $O(P + H^3 \log H)$ per time step, a significant improvement over the original SIPF method (proposed in \cite{SIPF1}), which has a computational complexity of $O(PH^3)$, while preserving numerical accuracy. Moreover, we carry out a rigorous error analysis for the proposed method and establish the corresponding error estimates. Finally, we present numerical experiments to validate the convergence order and demonstrate the computational efficiency of SIPF-PIC. Further numerical experiments show the method's capability of capturing complex blowup dynamics beyond single-point collapse, including ring-shaped singularities.</description>

Abstract: Recently, some window functions have been introduced into the nonuniform fast Fourier transform and the regularized Shannon sampling. Inspired by these works, we utilize a sinh-type function to accelerate the convergence of the Lagrangian nonuniform sampling series. Our theoretical error estimates and numerical experiments demonstrate that the sinh regularized nonuniform sampling series achieves a superior convergence rate compared to the fastest existing Gaussian regularized nonuniform sampling series.</description>

      <title>A Primal-Dual Level Set Method for Computing Geodesic Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical computation of shortest paths or geodesics on surfaces, along with the associated geodesic distance, has a wide range of applications. Compared to Euclidean distance computation, these tasks are more complex due to the influence of surface geometry on the behavior of shortest paths. This paper introduces a primal-dual level set method for computing geodesic distances. A key insight is that the underlying surface can be implicitly represented as a zero level set, allowing us to formulate a constraint minimization problem. We employ the primal-dual methodology, along with regularization and acceleration techniques, to develop our algorithm. This approach is robust, efficient, and easy to implement. We establish a convergence result for the high-resolution PDE system, and numerical evidence suggests that the method converges to a geodesic in the limit of refinement.</description>

      <title>Taylor-Accelerated Neural Network Interpolation Operators on Irregular Grids with Higher Order Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a new class of \emph{Taylor-accelerated neural network interpolation operators} is introduced on quasi-uniform irregular grids. These operators improve existing neural network interpolation operators by incorporating Taylor polynomials at the sampling nodes, thereby exploiting higher smoothness of the target function. The proposed operators are shown to be well defined, uniformly bounded, and to satisfy an exact interpolation property at the grid points. In addition, polynomial reproduction up to a prescribed degree is established. Jackson-type approximation estimates are derived in terms of higher-order moduli of smoothness, yielding enhanced convergence rates for sufficiently smooth functions. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement achieved through the Taylor-accelerated construction. In particular, higher-order convergence on irregular grids is obtained, and the proposed approach outperforms existing neural network interpolation operators on irregular grids, including Lagrange-based schemes.</description>

      <title>Avoided crossings, degeneracies and Berry phases in the spectrum of quantum noise of driven-dissipative bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Avoided crossings are fundamental phenomena in quantum mechanics and photonics that originate from the interaction between coupled energy levels and have been extensively studied in linear dispersive dynamics. Their manifestation in open, driven-dissipative systems, however, where nonlinear dynamics of quantum fluctuations come into play, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze the hitherto unexplored occurrence of avoided and genuine crossings in the spectrum of quantum noise. We demonstrate that avoided crossings arise naturally when a single parameter is varied, leading to hypersensitivity of the associated singular vectors and suggesting the presence of genuine crossings (diabolical points) in nearby systems. We show that these spectral features can be deliberately designed, highlighting the possibility of programming the quantum noise response of photonic systems. As a notable example, such control can be exploited to generate broad, flat-band squeezing spectra - a desirable feature for enhancing degaussification protocols. Our analysis is based on a detailed study of the Analytic Bloch-Messiah Decomposition (ABMD), which we use to characterize the parameter-dependent behavior of singular values and their corresponding vectors. This study provides new insights into the structure of multimode quantum correlations and offers a theoretical framework for the experimental exploitation of complex quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>An adaptive data sampling strategy for stabilizing dynamical systems via controller inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning stabilizing controllers from data is an important task in engineering applications; however, collecting informative data is challenging because unstable systems often lead to rapidly growing or erratic trajectories. In this work, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme that generates data while simultaneously stabilizing the system to avoid instabilities during the data collection. Under mild assumptions, the approach provably generates data sets that are informative for stabilization and have minimal size. The numerical experiments demonstrate that controller inference with the novel adaptive sampling approach learns controllers with up to one order of magnitude fewer data samples than unguided data generation. The results show that the proposed approach opens the door to stabilizing systems in edge cases and limit states where instabilities often occur and data collection is inherently difficult.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution $\pi$. It is well known that this can be written as an optimisation problem over the space of probability distribution in which we aim to minimise the Kullback--Leibler divergence from $\pi$. We consider several partial differential equations (PDEs) whose solution is a minimiser of the Kullback--Leibler divergence from $\pi$ and connect them to well-known Monte Carlo algorithms. We focus in particular on PDEs obtained by considering the Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao geometry over the space of probabilities and show that these lead to a natural implementation using importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo. We propose a novel algorithm to approximate the Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao flow of the Kullback--Leibler divergence and conduct an extensive empirical study to identify when these algorithms outperforms other popular Monte Carlo algorithms.</description>

      <title>Solving PDEs With Deep Neural Nets under General Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Hessian Scaling for Local and Global Costs in Variational Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms are typically described by gradient concentration at random initialization. In contrast, rigorous results for the Hessian, even at the level of entry-wise variance, remain limited. In this work, we analyze the scaling of Hessian-entry variances at initialization. Using exact second-order parameter-shift identities, we write $H_{jk}$ as a constant-size linear combination of shifted cost evaluations, which reduces ${\rm Var}_\rho(H_{jk})$ to a finite-dimensional covariance--quadratic form. For global objectives, under an exponential concentration condition on the cost at initialization, ${\rm Var}_\rho(H_{jk})$ decays exponentially with the number of qubits $n$. For local averaged objectives in bounded-depth circuits, ${\rm Var}_\rho(H_{jk})$ admits polynomial bounds controlled by the growth of the backward lightcone on the interaction graph. As a consequence, the number of measurement shots required to estimate $H_{jk}$ to fixed accuracy inherits the same exponential (global) or polynomial (local) scaling. Extensive numerical experiments over system size, circuit depth, and interaction graphs validate the predicted variance scaling. Overall, the paper quantifies when Hessian entries can be resolved at initialization under finite sampling, providing a mathematically grounded basis for second-order information in variational optimization.</description>

      <title>Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoders (vsPAIR) for Inverse Problems and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to many scientific and engineering disciplines; they arise when one seeks to reconstruct hidden, underlying quantities from noisy measurements. Many applications demand not just point estimates but interpretable uncertainty. Providing fast inference alongside uncertainty estimates remains challenging yet desirable in numerous applications.
  We propose the Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR) to address this challenge. The architecture pairs a standard VAE encoding observations with a sparse VAE encoding quantities of interest, connected through a learned latent mapping. The variational structure enables uncertainty estimation, the paired architecture encourages interpretability by anchoring QoI representations to clean data, and sparse encodings provide structure by concentrating information into identifiable factors rather than diffusing across all dimensions. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture, we conduct experiments on blind inpainting and computed tomography, demonstrating that vsPAIR is a capable inverse problem solver that can provide interpretable and structured uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>FlashSinkhorn: IO-Aware Entropic Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport (EOT) via Sinkhorn iterations is widely used in modern machine learning, yet GPU solvers remain inefficient at scale. Tensorized implementations suffer quadratic HBM traffic from dense $n\times m$ interactions, while existing online backends avoid storing dense matrices but still rely on generic tiled map-reduce reduction kernels with limited fusion. We present \textbf{FlashSinkhorn}, an IO-aware EOT solver for squared Euclidean cost that rewrites stabilized log-domain Sinkhorn updates as row-wise LogSumExp reductions of biased dot-product scores, the same normalization as transformer attention. This enables FlashAttention-style fusion and tiling: fused Triton kernels stream tiles through on-chip SRAM and update dual potentials in a single pass, substantially reducing HBM IO per iteration while retaining linear-memory operations. We further provide streaming kernels for transport application, enabling scalable first- and second-order optimization. On A100 GPUs, FlashSinkhorn achieves up to $32\times$ forward-pass and $161\times$ end-to-end speedups over state-of-the-art online baselines on point-cloud OT, improves scalability on OT-based downstream tasks. For reproducibility, we release an open-source implementation at https://github.com/ot-triton-lab/ot_triton.</description>
