      <title>Deuteration removes quantum dipolar defects from KDP crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural, dielectric, and thermodynamic properties of the hydrogen-bonded ferroelectric crystal potassium dihydrogen phosphate ($\mathbf{KH_2PO_4}$), KDP for short, differ significantly from those of DKDP ($\mathbf{KD_2PO_4}$). It is well established that deuteration affects the interplay of hydrogen-bond switches and heavy ion displacements that underlie the emergence of macroscopic polarization, but a detailed microscopic model is missing. Here we show that all-atom path integral molecular dynamics simulations can predict the isotope effects, revealing the microscopic mechanism that differentiates KDP and DKDP. Proton tunneling in the hydrogen bonds generates phosphate configurations that do not contribute to the polarization. These dipolar defects are always present in KDP, but disappear at low temperatures in DKDP, which behaves more classically. Quantum disorder confers residual entropy to ferroelectric KDP, explaining its lower spontaneous polarization and transition entropy relative to DKDP. Tunneling should also contribute to the anomalous heat capacity observed in KDP near absolute zero. The prominent role of quantum fluctuations in KDP is related to the unusual strength of the hydrogen bonds in this system and should be equally important in the other crystals of the KDP family, which exhibit similar isotope effects.</description>

      <title>Xiwu: A Basis Flexible and Learnable LLM for High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08001</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are undergoing a period of rapid updates and changes, with state-of-the-art (SOTA) model frequently being replaced. When applying LLMs to a specific scientific field, it's challenging to acquire unique domain knowledge while keeping the model itself advanced. To address this challenge, a sophisticated large language model system named as Xiwu has been developed, allowing you switch between the most advanced foundation models and quickly teach the model domain knowledge. In this work, we will report on the best practices for applying LLMs in the field of high-energy physics (HEP), including: a seed fission technology is proposed and some data collection and cleaning tools are developed to quickly obtain domain AI-Ready dataset; a just-in-time learning system is implemented based on the vector store technology; an on-the-fly fine-tuning system has been developed to facilitate rapid training under a specified foundation model. The results show that Xiwu can smoothly switch between foundation models such as LLaMA, Vicuna, ChatGLM and Grok-1. The trained Xiwu model is significantly outperformed the benchmark model on the HEP knowledge question-and-answering and code generation. This strategy significantly enhances the potential for growth of our model's performance, with the hope of surpassing GPT-4 as it evolves with the development of open-source models. This work provides a customized LLM for the field of HEP, while also offering references for applying LLM to other fields, the corresponding codes are available on Github.</description>

      <title>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from first principles quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong-light matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. The results highlight that strong-light matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

      <title>Minimization Principle for Analytical Solution of Turbulent Flow in Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical solution for turbulent flow in channel presented in Fedoseyev (2023), described the mean turbulent flow velocity as a superposition of the laminar (parabolic) and turbulent (superexponential) solutions. In this study, the coefficients of superposition are proposed to obtain through the minimization principle, the principle of minimum viscous dissipation. The obtained analytical solutions agree well with the experimental data for turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Coherence properties of NV-center ensembles in diamond coupled to an electron-spin bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) ensembles in diamond under the influence of strongly-correlated electron-spin baths. We thoroughly calculate the decoherence properties of the NV central spin for bath concentrations of 0.1-100 ppm using the cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) method. We systematically analyze possible origins of the significant deviations in the values of the $T_2$ coherence time reported in literature. We demonstrate that significant variations can originate from the choice of averaging and fitting procedures used for the ensemble average and we point out the respective aspects that need to be considered, when comparing the various theoretical studies. Our study may ease readers to perform reliable and fast simulations on the central spin problem. It provides an understanding and interpretation of the outcome parameters describing the dynamics of the local bath spins.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) inspired mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW methods we show that there is an all electron formulation. In the all electron formulation there are regular low wavevector wavefunctions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector wavefunctions that are specialized to the atomic environment. Using this as inspiration here we propose a new, PAW pseudopotential inspired, basis set method for small molecules, where we use the recently introduced LO basis set is paired with a Gaussian basis for a hybrid basis for small molecules.</description>

      <title>Tensor factorization in ab initio many-body calculations: Triaxially-deformed (B) MBPT calculations in large bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether for fundamental studies or nuclear data evaluations, first-principle calculations of atomic nuclei constitute the path forward. Today, performing \textit{ab initio} calculations (a) of heavy nuclei, (b) of doubly open-shell nuclei or (c) with a sub-percent accuracy is at the forefront of nuclear structure theory. While combining any two of these features constitutes a major challenge, addressing the three at the same time is currently impossible. From a numerical standpoint, these challenges relate to the necessity to handle (i) very large single bases and (ii) mode-6, \textit{i.e.} three-body, tensors (iii) that must be stored repeatedly. Performing second-order many-body perturbation theory(ies) calculations based on triaxially deformed and superfluid reference states of doubly open-shell nuclei up to mass $A=72$, the present work achieves a significant step forward by addressing challenge (i). To do so, the memory and computational cost associated with the handling of large tensors is scaled down via the use of tensor factorization techniques. The presently used factorization format is based on a randomized singular value decomposition that does not require the computation and storage of the very large initial tensor. The procedure delivers an inexpensive and controllable approximation to the original problem, as presently illustrated for calculations that could not be performed without tensor factorization. With the presently developed technology at hand, one can envision to perform calculations of yet heavier doubly open-shell nuclei at sub-percent accuracy in a foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Applying Machine Learning Methods to Laser Acceleration of Protons: Lessons Learned from Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers in the field of ultra-intense laser science are beginning to embrace machine learning methods. In this study we consider three different machine learning methods -- a two-hidden layer neural network, Support Vector Regression and Gaussian Process Regression -- and compare how well they can learn from a synthetic data set for proton acceleration in the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration regime. The synthetic data set was generated from a previously published theoretical model by Fuchs et al. 2005 that we modified. Once trained, these machine learning methods can assist with efforts to maximize the peak proton energy, or with the more general problem of configuring the laser system to produce a proton energy spectrum with desired characteristics. In our study we focus on both the accuracy of the machine learning methods and the performance on one GPU including the memory consumption. Although it is arguably the least sophisticated machine learning model we considered, Support Vector Regression performed very well in our tests.</description>

      <title>Foundational Competencies and Responsibilities of a Research Software Engineer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The term Research Software Engineer, or RSE, emerged a little over 10 years ago as a way to represent individuals working in the research community but focusing on software development. The term has been widely adopted and there are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is. However, the roles of RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in. At one end of the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role. At the other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry. Most RSE roles inhabit the space between these two extremes. Therefore, providing a straightforward, comprehensive definition of what an RSE does and what experience, skills and competencies are required to become one is challenging. In this community paper we define the broad notion of what an RSE is, explore the different types of work they undertake, and define a list of fundamental competencies as well as values that define the general profile of an RSE. On this basis, we elaborate on the progression of these skills along different dimensions, looking at specific types of RSE roles, proposing recommendations for organisations, and giving examples of future specialisations. An appendix details how existing curricula fit into this framework.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Machine Learning Solution of the Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As powerful as machine learning (ML) techniques are in solving problems involving data with large dimensionality, explaining the results from the fitted parameters remains a challenging task of utmost importance, especially in physics applications. This work shows how this can be accomplished for the ferromagnetic Ising model, the main target of several ML studies in statistical physics. Here it is demonstrated that the successful unsupervised identification of the phases and order parameter by principal component analysis, a common method in those studies, detects that the magnetization per spin has its greatest variation with the temperature, the actual control parameter of the phase transition. Then, by using a neural network (NN) without hidden layers (the simplest possible) and informed by the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, an explanation is provided for the strategy used in finding the supervised learning solution for the critical temperature of the model's continuous phase transition. This allows the prediction of the minimal extension of the NN to solve the problem when the symmetry is not known, which becomes also explainable. These results pave the way to a physics-informed explainable generalized framework, enabling the extraction of physical laws and principles from the parameters of the models.</description>

      <title>Peak finding algorithm for cluster counting with domain adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster counting in drift chamber is the most promising breakthrough in particle identification (PID) technique in particle physics experiment. Reconstruction algorithm is one of the key challenges in cluster counting. In this paper, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (DA) algorithm is developed and applied on the peak finding problem in cluster counting. The algorithm uses optimal transport (OT), which provides geometric metric between distributions, to align the samples between the source (simulation) and target (data) samples, and performs semi-supervised learning with the samples in target domain that are partially labeled with the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) algorithm. The model is validated by the pseudo data with labels, which achieves performance close to the fully supervised model. When applying the algorithm on real experimental data, taken at CERN with a 180 GeV/c muon beam, it shows better classification power than the traditional derivative-based algorithm, and the performance is stable for experimental data samples across varying track lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defects are a universal feature of crystalline solids, dictating the key properties and performance of many functional materials. Given their crucial importance yet inherent difficulty in measuring experimentally, computational methods (such as DFT and ML/classical force-fields) are widely used to predict defect behaviour at the atomic level and the resultant impact on macroscopic properties. Here we report doped, a Python package for the generation, pre-/post-processing, and analysis of defect supercell calculations. doped has been built to implement the defect simulation workflow in an efficient and user-friendly -- yet powerful and fully-flexible -- manner, with the goal of providing a robust general-purpose platform for conducting reproducible calculations of solid-state defect properties.</description>

      <title>BAMBOO: a predictive and transferable machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the way to a "universal MLFF" capable of simulating properties of common organic liquids.</description>
