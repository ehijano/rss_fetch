      <title>Predicting Multi-Agent Specialization via Task Parallelizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems often rely on specialized agents with distinct roles rather than general-purpose agents that perform the entire task independently. However, the conditions that govern the optimal degree of specialization remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose that specialist teams outperform generalist ones when environmental constraints limit task parallelizability -- the potential to execute task components concurrently. Drawing inspiration from distributed systems, we introduce a heuristic to predict the relative efficiency of generalist versus specialist teams by estimating the speed-up achieved when two agents perform a task in parallel rather than focus on complementary subtasks. We validate this heuristic through three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) experiments in Overcooked-AI, demonstrating that key factors limiting task parallelizability influence specialization. We also observe that as the state space expands, agents tend to converge on specialist strategies, even when generalist ones are theoretically more efficient, highlighting potential biases in MARL training algorithms. Our findings provide a principled framework for interpreting specialization given the task and environment, and introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating whether MARL finds optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>Consensus Tracking Control of Multi-agent Systems with A Time-varying Reference State under Binary-valued Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of consensus tracking control of discrete time multi-agent systems under binary-valued communication. Different from most existing studies on consensus tracking, the transmitted information between agents is the binary-valued. Parameter identification with binary-valued observations is applied to the estimation of neighbors'states and the tracking control is designed based on the estimation. Two Lyapunov functions are constructed to deal with the strong coupling of estimation and control. Compared with consensus problems under binary-valued communication, a reference state is required for consensus tracking control. Two scenarios of the time-varying reference state are studied respectively. (1) The reference state is asymptotically convergent. An online algorithm that performs estimation and control simultaneously is proposed, in which the estimation step size and the control gain are decreasing with time. By this algorithm, the multi-agent system is proved to achieve consensus tracking with convergence rate O(1/k^{\epsilon} ) under certain conditions. (2) The reference state is bounded, which is less conservative than that in the first case. In this case, the estimation step size and control gain are designed to be constant. By this algorithm, all the followers can reach to a neighborhood of the leader with an exponential rate. Finally, simulations are given to demonstrate theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Revival: Collaborative Artistic Creation through Human-AI Interactions in Musical Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revival is an innovative live audiovisual performance and music improvisation by our artist collective K-Phi-A, blending human and AI musicianship to create electronic music with audio-reactive visuals. The performance features real-time co-creative improvisation between a percussionist, an electronic music artist, and AI musical agents. Trained in works by deceased composers and the collective's compositions, these agents dynamically respond to human input and emulate complex musical styles. An AI-driven visual synthesizer, guided by a human VJ, produces visuals that evolve with the musical landscape. Revival showcases the potential of AI and human collaboration in improvisational artistic creation.</description>

      <title>Towards Computer-Using Personal Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUA) enable users to automate increasingly-complex tasks using graphical interfaces such as browsers. As many potential tasks require personal data, we propose Computer-Using Personal Agents (CUPAs) that have access to an external repository of the user's personal data. Compared with CUAs, CUPAs offer users better control of their personal data, the potential to automate more tasks involving personal data, better interoperability with external sources of data, and better capabilities to coordinate with other CUPAs in order to solve collaborative tasks involving the personal data of multiple users.</description>

      <title>KHAIT: K-9 Handler Artificial Intelligence Teaming for Collaborative Sensemaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In urban search and rescue (USAR) operations, communication between handlers and specially trained canines is crucial but often complicated by challenging environments and the specific behaviors canines are trained to exhibit when detecting a person. Since a USAR canine often works out of sight of the handler, the handler lacks awareness of the canine's location and situation, known as the 'sensemaking gap.' In this paper, we propose KHAIT, a novel approach to close the sensemaking gap and enhance USAR effectiveness by integrating object detection-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR). Equipped with AI-powered cameras, edge computing, and AR headsets, KHAIT enables precise and rapid object detection from a canine's perspective, improving survivor localization. We evaluate this approach in a real-world USAR environment, demonstrating an average survival allocation time decrease of 22%, enhancing the speed and accuracy of operations.</description>

      <title>Prompt Flow Integrity to Prevent Privilege Escalation in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are combined with plugins to create powerful LLM agents that provide a wide range of services. Unlike traditional software, LLM agent's behavior is determined at runtime by natural language prompts from either user or plugin's data. This flexibility enables a new computing paradigm with unlimited capabilities and programmability, but also introduces new security risks, vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks. Moreover, user prompt is prone to be interpreted in an insecure way by LLM agents, creating non-deterministic behaviors that can be exploited by attackers. To address these security risks, we propose Prompt Flow Integrity (PFI), a system security-oriented solution to prevent privilege escalation in LLM agents. Analyzing the architectural characteristics of LLM agents, PFI features three mitigation techniques -- i.e., untrusted data identification, enforcing least privilege on LLM agents, and validating unsafe data flows. Our evaluation result shows that PFI effectively mitigates privilege escalation attacks while successfully preserving the utility of LLM agents.</description>

      <title>Data Spatial Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel programming model, Data Spatial Programming, which extends the semantics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by introducing new class-like constructs called archetypes. These archetypes encapsulate spatial relationships between data entities and execution flow in a structured manner, enabling more expressive and semantically rich computations over interconnected data structures. By formalizing the relationships between data elements in space, our approach allows for more intuitive modeling of complex systems where the topology of connections is essential to the underlying computational model. This paradigm addresses limitations in traditional OOP when representing dynamically evolving networks, agent-based systems, and other spatially-oriented computational problems.</description>

      <title>Dispersion is (Almost) Optimal under (A)synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion problem has received much attention recently in the distributed computing literature. In this problem, $k\leq n$ agents placed initially arbitrarily on the nodes of an $n$-node, $m$-edge anonymous graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ have to reposition autonomously to reach a configuration in which each agent is on a distinct node of the graph. Dispersion is interesting as well as important due to its connections to many fundamental coordination problems by mobile agents on graphs, such as exploration, scattering, load balancing, relocation of self-driven electric cars (robots) to recharge stations (nodes), etc. The objective has been to provide a solution that optimizes simultaneously time and memory complexities. There exist graphs for which the lower bound on time complexity is $\Omega(k)$. Memory complexity is $\Omega(\log k)$ per agent independent of graph topology. The state-of-the-art algorithms have (i) time complexity $O(k\log^2k)$ and memory complexity $O(\log(k+\Delta))$ under the synchronous setting [DISC'24] and (ii) time complexity $O(\min\{m,k\Delta\})$ and memory complexity $O(\log(k+\Delta))$ under the asynchronous setting [OPODIS'21]. In this paper, we improve substantially on this state-of-the-art. Under the synchronous setting as in [DISC'24], we present the first optimal $O(k)$ time algorithm keeping memory complexity $O(\log (k+\Delta))$. Under the asynchronous setting as in [OPODIS'21], we present the first algorithm with time complexity $O(k\log k)$ keeping memory complexity $O(\log (k+\Delta))$, which is time-optimal within an $O(\log k)$ factor despite asynchrony. Both results were obtained through novel techniques to quickly find empty nodes to settle agents, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Reality Digital Twins: Leveraging the Physical and Virtual Worlds for Hybrid Sim2Real Transition of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10996v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for cyber-physical vehicle systems usually requires a significantly long training time due to their inherent complexity. Furthermore, deploying the trained policies in the real world demands a feature-rich environment along with multiple physical embodied agents, which may not be feasible due to monetary, physical, energy, or safety constraints. This work seeks to address these pain points by presenting a mixed-reality digital twin framework capable of: (i) selectively scaling parallelized workloads on-demand, and (ii) evaluating the trained policies across simulation-to-reality (sim2real) experiments. The viability and performance of the proposed framework are highlighted through two representative use cases, which cover cooperative as well as competitive classes of MARL problems. We study the effect of: (i) agent and environment parallelization on training time, and (ii) systematic domain randomization on zero-shot sim2real transfer across both case studies. Results indicate up to 76.3% reduction in training time with the proposed parallelization scheme and sim2real gap as low as 2.9% using the proposed deployment method.</description>
