      <title>Productivity profile of CNPq scholarship researchers in computer science from 2017 to 2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Productivity in Research (PQ) is a scholarship granted by CNPq (Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development). This scholarship aims to recognize a few selected faculty researchers for their scientific production, outstanding technology and innovation in their respective areas of knowledge. In the present study, we evaluated the scientific production of the 185 researchers in the Computer Science area granted with PQ scholarship in the last PQ selection notice. To evaluate the productivity of each professor, we considered papers published in scientific journals and conferences (complete works) in a five years period (from 2017 to 2021). We analyzed the productivity in terms of both quantity and quality. We also evaluated its distribution over the country, universities and research facilities, as well as, the co-authorship network produced.</description>

      <title>Improving Citation Text Generation: Overcoming Limitations in Length Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in citation text generation is that the length of generated text often differs from the length of the target, lowering the quality of the generation. While prior works have investigated length-controlled generation, their effectiveness depends on knowing the appropriate generation length. In this work, we present an in-depth study of the limitations of predicting scientific citation text length and explore the use of heuristic estimates of desired length.</description>

      <title>A Network Analysis Approach to Conlang Research Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of conlang has evidenced an important growth in the last decades. This has been the product of a wide interest in the use and study of conlangs for artistic purposes. However, one important question is what it is happening with conlang in the academic world. This paper aims to have an overall understanding of the literature on conlang research. With this we aim to give a realistic picture of the field in present days. We have implemented a computational linguistic approach, combining bibliometrics and network analysis to examine all publications available in the Scopus database. Analysing over 2300 academic publications since 1927 until 2022, we have found that Esperanto is by far the most documented conlang. Three main authors have contributed to this: Garv\'ia R., Fiedler S., and Blanke D. The 1970s and 1980s have been the decades where the foundations of current research have been built. In terms of methodologies, language learning and experimental linguistics are the ones contributing to most to the preferred approaches of study in the field. We present the results and discuss our limitations and future work.</description>

      <title>ILiAD: An Interactive Corpus for Linguistic Annotated Data from Twitter Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social Media platforms have offered invaluable opportunities for linguistic research. The availability of up-to-date data, coming from any part in the world, and coming from natural contexts, has allowed researchers to study language in real time. One of the fields that has made great use of social media platforms is Corpus Linguistics. There is currently a wide range of projects which have been able to successfully create corpora from social media. In this paper, we present the development and deployment of a linguistic corpus from Twitter posts in English, coming from 26 news agencies and 27 individuals. The main goal was to create a fully annotated English corpus for linguistic analysis. We include information on morphology and syntax, as well as NLP features such as tokenization, lemmas, and n- grams. The information is presented through a range of powerful visualisations for users to explore linguistic patterns in the corpus. With this tool, we aim to contribute to the area of language technologies applied to linguistic research.</description>
