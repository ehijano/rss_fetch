      <title>Statistical physics on Euclidean Snyder space: connections with the GUP and cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic formulation of statistical mechanics on Euclidean Snyder space, where noncommutativity is geometrically encoded in the curvature of momentum space. Adopting a realization independent approach based on momentum-space invariants, we derive modified partition functions and thermodynamic quantities for systems obeying Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics in both non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic regimes. We show that momentum-space curvature induces temperature-dependent corrections that suppress the energy, entropy and energy density with respect to their standard counterparts. We apply these results to early-Universe cosmology, deriving the corresponding corrections to the Friedmann equations driven by the modified energy density of radiation. Using Big Bang Nucleosynthesis as a precision probe, we derive bounds on the Snyder deformation parameter and, via a phenomenological mapping, on the Generalized Uncerainty Principle (GUP) parameter, providing one of the most stringent cosmological and astrophysical constraints currently available. Our analysis demonstrates that high-energy cosmological processes provide a predictive arena for testing momentum-space curvature and noncommutative geometry effects.</description>

      <title>Discrete dynamical systems with scaling and inversion symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate scale invariance in the temporal evolution and chaotic regime of discrete dynamical systems. By exploiting the close interrelation between scaling and inversion transformations, we formulate scale symmetry in terms of inversion symmetry. As applications of our approach, we determine fractal dimensions and compute Lyapunov exponents for paradigmatic dynamical systems using scaling and inversion symmetries. By comparing our method with standard approaches, we obtain identical numerical values for the Lyapunov exponents using only a small number of iterations. Furthermore, our geometric-based framework naturally provides access to the fractal dimension. The agreement with standard results demonstrates that the proposed method is efficient and can be effectively employed in the study of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>The missing elements in the telegraph equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional modeling of transmission lines relies on the classical telegraph equations, originally formulated over 150 years ago. These equations are typically derived by representing the line as an assembly of infinitesimal inductive, capacitive, and resistive elements. However, this formulation is fundamentally flawed, as a transmission line cannot be accurately described through a discretized model of infinitesimal lumped components. Instead, a more rigorous approach should derive the governing equations directly from Maxwells equations in conjunction with Ohms law. This paper presents such a derivation and introduces a corrected formulation, herein referred to as the Trump Equations.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to describe an electron by the evolution of a single point?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The answer to the title-question is affirmative. The analysis of the geometry of continuous and differentiable curves in three-dimensional Euclidean space suggests that the point represents the location of the center of charge of the electron, satisfies a system of ordinary differential equations of fourth order, and moves at the speed of light. The center of mass of the electron is a different point and will be determined by the evolution of the center of charge. It is the relative motion of the center of charge around the center of mass that gives rise to the spin and magnetic properties. The invariance of the mass and the absolute value of the spin for the center of mass observer imply that in the interaction of the electron with an external electromagnetic field the particle has to radiate.</description>
