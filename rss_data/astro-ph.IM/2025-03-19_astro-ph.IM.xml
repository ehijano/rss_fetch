      <title>Development of the Timing System for the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the development, design, ground verification, and in-orbit verification, performance measurement, and calibration of the timing system for the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). The scientific goals of the mission require an absolute timing accuracy of 1.0~ms. All components of the timing system were designed and verified to be within the timing error budgets, which were assigned by component to meet the requirements. After the launch of XRISM, the timing capability of the ground-tuned timing system was verified using the millisecond pulsar PSR~B1937+21 during the commissioning period, and the timing jitter of the bus and the ground component were found to be below $15~\mu$s compared to the NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR) profile. During the performance verification and calibration period, simultaneous observations of the Crab pulsar by XRISM, NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array), and NICER were made to measure the absolute timing offset of the system, showing that the arrival time of the main pulse with XRISM was aligned with that of NICER and NuSTAR to within $200~\mu$s. In conclusion, the absolute timing accuracy of the bus and the ground component of the XRISM timing system meets the timing error budget of $500~\mu$s.</description>

      <title>Strategic White Paper on AI Infrastructure for Particle, Nuclear, and Astroparticle Physics: Insights from JENA and EuCAIF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific research, with deep learning methods playing a central role in data analysis, simulations, and signal detection across particle, nuclear, and astroparticle physics. Within the JENA communities-ECFA, NuPECC, and APPEC-and as part of the EuCAIF initiative, AI integration is advancing steadily. However, broader adoption remains constrained by challenges such as limited computational resources, a lack of expertise, and difficulties in transitioning from research and development (R&amp;D) to production. This white paper provides a strategic roadmap, informed by a community survey, to address these barriers. It outlines critical infrastructure requirements, prioritizes training initiatives, and proposes funding strategies to scale AI capabilities across fundamental physics over the next five years.</description>

      <title>Computing the Wave: Where the Gravitational Wave Community benefits from High-Energy Physics, and where it differs ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Energy Physics (HEP) and Gravitational Wave (GW) communities serve different scientific purposes. However, their methodologies might potentially offer mutual enrichment through common software developments. A suite of libraries is currently being prototyped and made available at https://git.ligo.org/kagra/libraries-addons/root, extending at no cost the CERN ROOT data analysis framework toward advanced signal processing. We will also present a performance benchmark comparing the FFTW and KFR library performances.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: Living on the Wedge, or, NIRCam Bar Coronagraphy Reveals CO$_2$ in the HR 8799 and 51 Eri Exoplanets' Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-contrast observations with JWST can reveal key composition and vertical mixing dependent absorption features in the spectra of directly imaged planets across the 3-5 $\mu$m wavelength range. We present novel coronagraphic images of the HR 8799 and 51 Eri planetary systems using the NIRCam Long Wavelength Bar in an offset "narrow" position. These observations have revealed the four known gas giant planets encircling HR 8799, even at spatial separations challenging for a 6.5 m telescope in the mid-infrared, including the first ever detection of HR 8799 e at 4.6 $\mu$m. The chosen filters constrain the strength of CO, CH4, and CO2 absorption in each planet's photosphere. The planets display a diversity of 3-5 $\mu$m colors that could be due to differences in composition and ultimately be used to trace their formation history. They also show stronger CO2 absorption than expected from solar metallicity models, indicating that they are metal enriched. We detected 51 Eri b at 4.1 $\mu$m and not at longer wavelengths, which, given the planet's temperature, is indicative of out-of-equilibrium carbon chemistry and an enhanced metallicity. Updated orbits fit to the new measurement of 51 Eri b validate previous studies that find a preference for high eccentricities ($e{=}0.57_{-0.09}^{+0.03}$), which likely indicates some dynamical processing in the system's past. These results present an exciting opportunity to model the atmospheres and formation histories of these planets in more detail in the near future, and are complementary to future higher-resolution, continuum-subtracted JWST spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey: Modeling strategy for multiprobe cluster cosmology and validation for the Full Six-year Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an updated To&amp;Krause2021 model for joint analyses of cluster abundances and large-scale two-point correlations of weak lensing and galaxy and cluster clustering (termed CL+3x2pt analysis) and validate that this model meets the systematic accuracy requirements of analyses with the statistical precision of the final Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 6 (Y6) dataset. The validation program consists of two distinct approaches, (1) identification of modeling and parameterization choices and impact studies using simulated analyses with each possible model misspecification (2) end-to-end validation using mock catalogs from customized Cardinal simulations that incorporate realistic galaxy populations and DES-Y6-specific galaxy and cluster selection and photometric redshift modeling, which are the key observational systematics. In combination, these validation tests indicate that the model presented here meets the accuracy requirements of DES-Y6 for CL+3x2pt based on a large list of tests for known systematics. In addition, we also validate that the model is sufficient for several other data combinations: the CL+GC subset of this data vector (excluding galaxy--galaxy lensing and cosmic shear two-point statistics) and the CL+3x2pt+BAO+SN (combination of CL+3x2pt with the previously published Y6 DES baryonic acoustic oscillation and Y5 supernovae data).</description>

      <title>UNIONS: The Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) is a "collaboration of collaborations" that is using the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope, the Pan-STARRS telescopes, and the Subaru Observatory to obtain $ugriz$ images of a core survey region of 6250 deg$^2$ of the northern sky. The $10\sigma$ point source depth of the data, as measured within a 2-arcsecond diameter aperture, are $[u,g,r,i,z] = [23.7, 24.5, 24.2, 23.8, 23.3]$\ in AB magnitudes. UNIONS is addressing some of the most fundamental questions in astronomy, including the properties of dark matter, the growth of structure in the Universe from the very smallest galaxies to large-scale structure, and the assembly of the Milky Way. It is set to become the major ground-based legacy survey for the northern hemisphere for the next decade and provides an essential northern complement to the static-sky science of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time. UNIONS supports the core science mission of the {\it Euclid} space mission by providing the data necessary in the northern hemisphere for the calibration of the wavelength dependence of the {\it Euclid} point-spread function and derivation of photometric redshifts in the North Galactic Cap. This region contains the highest quality sky for {\it Euclid}, with low backgrounds from the zodiacal light, stellar density, extinction, and emission from Galactic cirrus. Here, we describe the UNIONS survey components, science goals, data products, and the current status of the overall program.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Youth: Decades of Mid-Infrared Variability and Color Evolution of Young Stellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variability of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is a crucial tool for understanding the mechanisms driving flux changes. In this study, we present an infrared variability analysis of a large sample of over 20,000 candidate YSOs, using data from the ALLWISE and NEOWISE surveys, which span around a decade with a 6-month cadence. We applied Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) analysis and linear fitting to the light curves, classifying them into distinct categories: {\it Secular} ({\it Linear}, {\it Curved}, and {\it Periodic}) and {\it Stochastic} ({\it Burst}, {\it Drop}, and {\it Irregular}). Our findings show that 5,467 (26.2$\pm$0.3\%) of the sources exhibit variability, with most (19.7$\pm$0.3\%) showing {\it Irregular} variations, followed by {\it Curved} and {\it Periodic} variations. In addition, 235 sources of {\it Bursts} and 122 {\it Drop} sources were identified. Variability is more pronounced in Class I sources with a higher fraction of variables (36.3$\pm$0.6\%) compared to Class II (22.1$\pm$0.4\%) and Class III (22.5$\pm$1.0\%) sources. The color (W1 $-$ W2) versus magnitude analysis (W2) using linear fitting shows that the trend ``redder-when-brighter" (RWB) is more prevalent (85.4$\pm$0.5\%) among YSOs. In contrast, the trend ``bluer-when-brighter" (BWB) is more common in younger sources compared to more evolved ones, having a BWB fraction of 29.0$\pm$1.1\% for Class I to 4.0$\pm$0.9\% for Class III.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 15 degrees can experience average residuals of 12.4 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 155 degrees at distances below 1500 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 10 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than two degrees beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>

      <title>The CatSouth Quasar Candidate Catalog for the Southern Sky and a Unified All-Sky Catalog Based on Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia DR3 has provided a large sample of more than 6.6 million quasar candidates with high completeness but low purity. Previous work on the CatNorth quasar candidate catalog has shown that including external multiband data and applying machine-learning methods can efficiently purify the original Gaia DR3 quasar candidate catalog and improve the redshift estimates. In this paper, we extend the Gaia DR3 quasar candidate selection to the southern hemisphere using data from SkyMappper, CatWISE, and VISTA surveys. We train an XGBoost classifier on a unified set of high-confidence stars and spectroscopically confirmed quasars and galaxies. For sources with available Gaia BP/RP spectra, spectroscopic redshifts are derived using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (RegNet). We also train an ensemble photometric redshift estimation model based on XGBoost, TabNet, and FT-Transformer, achieving an RMSE of 0.2256 and a normalized median absolute deviation of 0.0187 on the validation set. By merging CatSouth with the previously published CatNorth catalog, we construct the unified all-sky CatGlobe catalog with nearly 1.9 million sources at $G&lt;21$, providing a comprehensive and high-purity quasar candidate sample for future spectroscopic and cosmological investigations.</description>

      <title>A pre-flyby view on the origin of asteroid Donaldjohanson, a target of the NASA Lucy mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NASA Lucy mission is scheduled to fly-by the main belt asteroid (52246) Donaldjohanson on April 20, 2025. Donaldjohanson (DJ hereafter) is a member of the primitive (C-type class) Erigone collisional asteroid family located in the inner main belt in proximity of the source regions of asteroid (101955)~Bennu and (162173)~Ryugu, visited respectively by OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 missions. In this paper we provide an updated model for the Erigone family age, and discuss DJ evolution resulting from non-gravitational forces (namely Yarkovsky and YORP), as well as its collisional evolution. We conclude the best-fit family age to be $\sim 155$~Myr, and that, on such timescales, both Yarkovsky and YORP effects may have affected the orbit and spin properties of DJ. Furthermore, we discuss how the NASA Lucy mission could provide independent insights on such processes, namely by constraining DJ shape, surface geology and cratering history.</description>

      <title>gammapy_SyLC: A Package for Simulating and Fitting Variability in High-Energy Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the temporal variability of astrophysical sources is key to understanding the underlying physical processes driving their emissions. This work introduces a gammapy_SyLC, a Python package that offers tools to simulate and fit time-domain data, with a focus on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) variability. The package was developed taking into account possible interactions with gammapy but does not directly depend on it. gammapy_SyLC incorporates optimized implementations of the Timmer &amp; Koenig and Emmanoulopoulos algorithms for light curve simulation, capable of generating synthetic lightcurves from specified PSDs and amplitude distribution models. It also provides functionalities for PSD fitting, histogram-based PDF interpolation, and Monte Carlo-based parameter estimation, making it a full-stack tool for investigating variable phenomena and specifically the long-term behavior of AGNs. To showcase its capabilities, the package was applied to gamma-ray light curves from the Fermi Large Area Telescope repository, reconstructing PSDs and PDFs and constraining variability models for observed sources.</description>

      <title>XL-Calibur measurements of polarised hard X-ray emission from the Crab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of the linear polarisation degree (PD) and angle (PA) for hard X-ray emission from the Crab pulsar and wind nebula. Measurements were made with the XL-Calibur ($\sim$15-80 keV) balloon-borne Compton-scattering polarimeter in July 2024. The polarisation parameters are determined using a Bayesian analysis of Stokes parameters obtained from X-ray scattering angles. Well-constrained ($\sim$8.5$\sigma$) results are obtained for the polarisation of the $\sim$19-64 keV signal integrated over all pulsar phases: PD=(25.1$\pm$2.9)% and PA=(129.8$\pm$3.2)$^\circ$. In the off-pulse (nebula-dominated) phase range, the PD is constrained at $\sim$4.5$\sigma$ and is compatible with the phase-integrated result. The PA of the nebular hard X-ray emission aligns with that measured by IXPE in the 2-8 keV band for the toroidal inner region of the pulsar wind nebula, where the hard X-rays predominantly originate. For the main pulsar peak, PD=(32.8$^{+18.2}_{-28.5}$)% and PA=(156.0 $\pm$ 21.7)$^\circ$, while for the second peak (inter-pulse), PD=(0.0$^{+33.6}_{-0.0}$)% and PA=(154.5 $\pm$ 34.5)$^\circ$. A low level of polarisation in the pulsar peaks likely does not favour emission originating from the inner regions of the pulsar magnetosphere. Discriminating between Crab pulsar emission models will require deeper observations, e.g. with a satellite-borne hard X-ray polarimeter.</description>

      <title>Optimization of geomagnetic shielding based on detection efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the progressive increase in size of the latest Cherenkov-type detectors, it is becoming increasingly important to design a suitable compensation system based on coils of the Earth's magnetic field to ensure the correct operation of the photomultipliers (PMTs). Until now, most studies have assessed the correct functioning of such a system by the proportion of PMTs experiencing more than 100 mG of magnetic field perpendicular to their axis. In the present study, we discuss whether this evaluation parameter is the most appropriate and propose the average residual perpendicular magnetic field $&lt;B_{perp}&gt;$ as an alternative that more closely reflects the loss of detection efficiency of PMTs. A compensation system design is also proposed that offers good results as well as being economical to optimise this parameter.</description>

      <title>A new method to retrieve the star formation history from white dwarf luminosity functions -- an application to the Gaia catalogue of nearby stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the state-of-the-art Gaia astrometry, the number of confirmed white dwarfs has reached a few hundred thousand. We have reached the era where small features in the white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) of the solar neighbourhood can be resolved. We demonstrate how to apply Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling on a set of pre-computed partial-WDLFs to derive the star formation history of their progenitor stellar populations. We compare the results against many well-accepted and established works using various types of stars, including white dwarfs, main sequence stars, sub-giants and the entire stellar population. We find convincing agreements among most of the methods, particularly at the intermediate age of 0.1-9 Gyr.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropy at arcminute resolution over three frequency bands centered on 98, 150 and 220 GHz. The maps are based on data collected with the AdvancedACT camera over the period 2017--2022 and cover 19,000 square degrees with a median combined depth of 10 uK arcmin. We describe the instrument, mapmaking and map properties and illustrate them with a number of figures and tables. The ACT DR6 maps and derived products are available on LAMBDA at https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/actadv_prod_table.html. We also provide an interactive web atlas at https://phy-act1.princeton.edu/public/snaess/actpol/dr6/atlas and HiPS data sets in Aladin (e.g. https://alasky.cds.unistra.fr/ACT/DR4DR6/color_CMB).</description>

      <title>Novel SiC UV Instrumentation Development with Potential Applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>

      <title>Using the XMM-Newton small window mode to investigate systematic uncertainties in the particle background of X-ray charge-coupled device detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The level and uncertainty of the particle induced background in CCD detectors plays a crucial role for future X-ray instruments, such as the Wide Field Imager (WFI) onboard Athena. To mitigate the background systematic uncertainties, which will limit the Athena science goals, we aim to understand the relationship between the energetic charged particles interacting in the detector and satellite, and the instrumental science background to an unprecedented level. These particles produce easily identified "cosmic-ray tracks" along with less easily identified signals produced by secondary particles, e.g., X-rays generated by particle interactions with the instrument and indistinguishable from genuine sky X-rays. We utilize the Small Window Mode of the PN camera onboard XMM-Newton to understand the time, spatial and energy dependence of the various background components, particularly the particle induced background. While the distribution of particle events follows expected detector readout patterns, we find a particle track length distribution inconsistent with the simple, isotropic model. We also find that the detector mode-specific readout results in a shifted Cu fluorescent line. We illustrate that on long timescales the variability of the particle background correlates well with the solar cycle. This 20-year lightcurve, can be reproduced by a particle detector onboard Chandra, the HRC anti-coincidence shield. We conclude that the self-anti-coincidence method of removing X-ray-like events near detected particle tracks in the same frame can be optimized with the inclusion of additional information, such as the energy of the X-ray. The results presented here are relevant for any future pixelated X-ray imaging detector, and could allow the WFI to probe to truly faint X-ray surface brightness.</description>

      <title>One never walks alone: the effect of the perturber population on subhalo measurements in strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyses of extended arcs in strong gravitational lensing images to date have constrained the properties of dark matter by measuring the parameters of one or two individual subhalos. However, since such analyses are reliant on likelihood-based methods like Markov-chain Monte Carlo or nested sampling, they require various compromises to the realism of lensing models for the sake of computational tractability, such as ignoring the numerous other subhalos and line-of-sight halos in the system, assuming a particular form for the source model and requiring the noise to have a known likelihood function. Here we show that a simulation-based inference method calledTruncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) makes it possible to relax these requirements by training neural networks to directly compute marginal posteriors for subhalo parameters from lensing images. By performing a set of inference tasks on mock data, we verify the accuracy of TMNRE and show it can compute posteriors for subhalo parameters marginalized over populations of hundreds of substructures, as well as lens and source uncertainties. We also find the \gls*{mlp} Mixer network works far better for such tasks than the convolutional architectures explored in other lensing analyses. Furthermore, we show that since \gls*{tmnre} learns a posterior function it enables direct statistical checks that would be extremely expensive with likelihood-based methods. Our results show that TMNRE is well-suited for analyzing complex lensing data, and that the full subhalo and line-of-sight halo population must be included when measuring the properties of individual dark matter substructures with this technique.</description>

      <title>Toward a computationally-efficient follow-up pipeline for blind continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of continuous gravitational-wave (CW) searches for unknown neutron stars (NSs) is limited by their parameter space breadth. To fit within reasonable computing budgets, hierarchical schemes are used to identify interesting candidates using affordable methods. The resulting sensitivity depends on the number of candidates selected to follow-up. In this work, we present a novel framework to evaluate the effectiveness of stochastic CW follow-ups. Our results allow for a significant reduction of the computing cost of pyfstat, a well-established follow-up method. We also simplify the setup of multistage follow-ups by removing the need for parameter-space metrics. The study was conducted on Gaussian and real O3 Advanced LIGO data covering both isolated and binary sources. These results will have a positive impact on the sensitivity of all-sky searches in the forthcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>Sky localization of gravitational waves from eccentric binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers can be used to improve their sky localization using gravitational wave observations. Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. We also lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We indicate a few possible cases of improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward any detectable eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.</description>

      <title>An Early Look at the Performance of IGRINS-2 at Gemini-North with Application to the ultrahot Jupiter, WASP-33 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy enables precise molecular detections, and velocity-resolved atmospheric dynamics, offering a distinct advantage over low-resolution methods for exoplanetary atmospheric studies. IGRINS-2, the successor to IGRINS, features improved throughput and enhanced sensitivity to carbon monoxide by shifting its $\textit{K}$-band coverage by ~36 nm to longer wavelengths. To evaluate its performance, we attempt to investigate the atmospheric characteristics of WASP-33 b. Observations were conducted on 2024 January 7 for a total of 2.43 hours; This includes 1.46 hours in the pre-eclipse phase to capture the planet's thermal emission spectrum. Our analysis, employing a composite atmospheric model, confirms the presence of a thermally inverted atmosphere on the planet's dayside with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 7.5. More specifically, we capture CO, H$_{2}$O, and OH with SNRs of 5.2, 4.2, and 4.4, respectively. These results are consistent with previous studies and demonstrate that IGRINS-2 is well-suited for detailed investigation of exoplanetary atmospheres. We anticipate that future observations with IGRINS-2 will further advance our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>
