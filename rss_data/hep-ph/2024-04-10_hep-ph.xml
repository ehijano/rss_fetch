      <title>Vector meson production using the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation including the dipole orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceedings a solution of the target-rapidity Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation is presented considering the complete impact-parameter dependence, including the orientation of the dipole with respect to the impact-parameter vector. The target-rapidity formulation of the BK equation introduces non-locality in rapidity. Three different prescriptions are considered to take into account the rapidities preceding the initial condition. The solutions are used to compute the structure functions of the proton and the diffractive photo- and electro-production of J/{\psi} off protons. The predictions agree well with HERA data, confirming that the target-rapidity Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with the full impact-parameter dependence is a viable tool to study the small Bjorken-x limit of perturbative QCD at current facilities like RHIC and LHC as well as in future colliders like the EIC.</description>

      <title>The $SU(3)_C\times SU(3)_L\times U(1)_X$ (331) Model:Addressing the Fermion Families Problem within Horizontal Anomalies Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important and unanswered problems in particle physics is the origin of the three generations of quarks and leptons. The standard Model does not provide any hint regarding its sequential charge assignments, which remain a fundamental mystery of Nature. One possible solution of the puzzle is to look for charge assignments, in a given gauge theory, that are inter-generational, by employing the cancellation of the gravitational and gauge anomalies horizontally. The 331 model, based on an $SU(3)_C\times SU(3)_L \times U(1)_X$ does it in an economic way, and defines a possible extension of the Standard Model, where the number of families has to be necessarily three. We review the model in Frampton's formulation, that predicts the existence of bileptons. Another characteristics of the model is to unify the $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_X$ into the 331 symmetry at a scale which is in the TeV range, and can be tested at the LHC. Expressions of the scalar mass eigenstates and of the renormalization group equations of the model are also presented.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice QCD results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>

      <title>Explaining the cosmological dark matter coincidence in asymmetric dark QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To properly solve the coincidence problem ($\Omega_\mathrm{DM} \simeq 5\Omega_\mathrm{VM}$) in a model of asymmetric dark matter, one cannot simply relate the number densities of visible and dark matter without also relating their particle masses. Following previous work, we consider a framework where the dark matter is a confined state of a dark QCD gauge group whose confinement scale is dynamically related to the QCD confinement scale by a mechanism utilising infrared fixed points of the two gauge couplings. In this work we present a new, `zero-coupling infrared fixed point' approach, which allows a larger proportion of models in this framework to generically relate the masses of the visible and dark matter particles. Due to the heavy mass scale required for the new field content, we introduce supersymmetry to the theory. We consider how these models may be incorporated in a full theory of asymmetric dark matter, presenting some example leptogenesis-like models. We also discuss the phenomenology of these models; in particular, there are gravitational wave signals which, while weak, may be measurable at future mHz and $\mu$Hz detectors.</description>

      <title>Inflation, Proton Decay and Gravitational Waves from Metastable Strings in $SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a realistic supersymmetric $\mu$-hybrid inflation model within the framework of $SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$ gauge symmetry, wherein the symmetry breaking $SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R\rightarrow SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_{B-L}\times U(1)_R$ occurs before observable inflation, effectively eliminating topologically stable primordial monopoles. Subsequent breaking of $U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_R \rightarrow U(1)_Y$ after inflation leads to the formation of superheavy metastable cosmic strings (CSs), capable of producing a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) consistent with the recent PTA data. Moreover, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ align with Planck 2018 observations. A consistent scenario for reheating and non-thermal leptogenesis is employed to explain the observed matter content of the universe. Finally, the embedding of $G_{421}$ into the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry $G_{422}$ is briefly discussed, predicting potentially observable proton decay rates detectable at facilities such as Hyper Kamiokande and DUNE.</description>

      <title>Higgs Alignment from Multicritical-Point Principle in Two Higgs Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In models with non-minimal Higgs sectors, enforcing (near) Higgs alignment, necessary to prevent significant deviations in the Higgs boson coupling from the standard model prediction, causes a serious fine-tuning problem. We demonstrate that the Higgs alignment is naturally deduced from the multicritical point principle (MPP) in the general two Higgs doublet model. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of realizing the Yukawa alignment from the MPP, which is necessary to prevent flavor-changing neutral currents mediated by Higgs bosons at tree level.</description>

      <title>Thermal axion production at hard and soft momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot axions, thermally produced in the Early Universe, would contribute to dark radiation and are thus subject to present and future constraints from $N_{\rm eff}$. In this paper we quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$ and its uncertainty in models with axion-gluon couplings from thermal dynamics above the QCD transition. In more detail, we determine the leading-order thermal axion production rate for axion momenta of the order of the temperature adopting three different schemes for the incorporation of the collective dynamics of soft gluons. We show how these three schemes extrapolate differently into the regime of softer axion production, thus giving us a quantitative handle on the theory uncertainty of the rate. Upon solving the Boltzmann equation, we find that this theory uncertainty translates to an uncertainty of at most 0.002 for $N_{\rm eff}$. The uncertainty from common momentum-averaged approximations to the Boltzmann equation is smaller. We also comment on existing rate determinations in the literature and discuss how QCD transition dynamics would need to be integrated into our results.</description>

      <title>Soft contributions to the thermal Higgs width across an electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the equilibration rate of a nearly homogeneous Higgs field, displaced from its ground state during the onset of an electroweak phase transition. The computation is carried out with Hard Thermal Loop resummed perturbation theory, and a significant part of the result originates from Bose-enhanced $t$-channel $2\leftrightarrow 2$ scatterings. The expression is shown to be IR finite and gauge independent. Possible applications to Langevin simulations of bubble nucleation are mentioned, and we also contrast with the friction affecting bubble growth.</description>

      <title>Quark flavor violation and axion-like particles from top-quark decays at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study axion-like particles (ALPs) with quark-flavor-violating couplings at the LHC. Specifically, we focus on the theoretical scenario with ALP-top-up and ALP-top-charm interactions, in addition to the more common quark-flavor-diagonal couplings. The ALPs can thus originate from decays of top quarks which are pair produced in large numbers at the LHC, and then decay to jets. If these couplings to the quarks are tiny and the ALPs have $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV masses, they are long-lived, leading to signatures of displaced vertex plus multiple jets, which have the advantage of suppression of background events at the LHC. We recast a recent ATLAS search for the same signature and reinterpret the results in terms of bounds on the long-lived ALP in our theoretical scenario. We find that the LHC with the full Run 2 dataset can place stringent limits, while at the future high-luminosity LHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity stronger sensitivities are expected.</description>

      <title>Production of $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ near the thresholds in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the nontrivial energy dependencies of $D\bar{D}$, $D\bar{D}^{*}$, and $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ pair production cross sections in $e^{+}e^{- }$ annihilation are well described within the approach based on account for the final-state interaction of produced particles. This statement is valid for production of charged and neutral particles. Interaction of $D^{(*)}$ and $\bar{D}^{(*)}$ is taken into account using the effective potential method. Its applicability is based on the fact that for near-threshold resonance the characteristic width of peak in the wave function is much larger than the interaction radius. The transition amplitudes between all three channels play an important role in the description of cross sections. These transitions are possible since all channels have the same quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{--}$.</description>

      <title>Study of the timelike electromagnetic form factors of the $\Lambda_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the reaction of electron-positron annihilation into $\Lambda_c^+\bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ is investigated. The $\Lambda_c^+\bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ scattering amplitudes are obtained by solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The contact, annihilation, and two pseudoscalar-exchange potentials are taken into account in the spirit of the chiral effective field theory. The amplitudes of $e^+e^-\to \Lambda_c^+\bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ are constructed by the distorted wave Born approximation method, with the final state interactions of the $\Lambda_c^+\bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ re-scattering implemented. By fitting to the experimental data, the unknown couplings are fixed, and high-quality solutions are obtained. With these amplitudes, the individual electromagnetic form factors in the timelike region, $G_E^{\Lambda_c}$, $G_M^{\Lambda_c}$, and their ratio, $G_E^{\Lambda_c}/G_M^{\Lambda_c}$, are extracted. Both modulus and phases are predicted. These individual electromagnetic form factors reveal new insights into the properties of the $\Lambda_c$. The separated contributions of the Born term, contact, annihilation, as well as the two pseudoscalar exchange potentials to the electromagnetic form factors are isolated. It is found that the Born term dominates the whole energy region. The contact term plays a crucial role in the enhancement near the threshold, and the annihilation term is essential in generating the fluctuation of the electromagnetic form factors.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the very recent observation of the $B^+_c\to J/\psi+\pi^+ +\pi^0$ decay using proton-proton collision data by the LHCb collaboration, we study the four-body angular distributions and the quantum entanglement effects in the $B^+_c\to J/\psi+\pi^+ +\pi^0$ associated with $J/\psi\to \mu^++\mu^-$. The helicity angular distributions are given in the QCD effective theory and the von Neumann entropy is obtained in $B^\pm_c\to J/\psi(\to \mu^+\mu^-)+\rho^\pm(\to \pi^\pm \pi^0)$ decay process.</description>

      <title>Dark sterile neutrinos on a linear seesaw of neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos as source of the mass and flavor mixing of active neutrinos as well as genesis of the dark matter (DM) and matter-antimatter asymmetry have gained special interest. Here we study the case of the Standard Model (SM) extended with three right-handed (RH) neutrinos and a dark sector with two extra sterile neutrinos, odd under a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. The RH neutrinos are responsible for producing the baryon asymmetry via the high-scale unflavored leptogenesis. They are superheavy and their abundance at the electroweak broken stage is vanishingly small, so that they have no impact on the phenomenology at low energies. The two dark neutrinos generate the tiny mass of two active neutrinos through a mechanism similar to the minimal linear seesaw, and saturate the relic abundance as freeze-in DM via decay of the heavy SM bosons. The absence of the dark Majorana mass terms in the dark linear seesaw is explained by invoking a hidden symmetry, the so-called presymmetry, and the DM candidate appears in the form of a quasi-Dirac neutrino. The $Z_2$ symmetry is broken in the dark neutrino sector, but exact in the realm of RH neutrinos. The required coupling weakness for the freeze-in DM neutrino is related to a very small breach of unitarity in the active neutrino mixing matrix. We show how phenomenological constraints on the production and decay of the DM neutrino imply an upper bound around 1 MeV for its mass and unitarity up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ for the mixing matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational form factors of charmonium. Our method is based on a Hamiltonian formalism on the light front known as basis light-front quantization. The charmonium mass spectrum and light-front wave functions were obtained from diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates confinement from holographic QCD and one-gluon exchange interaction from light-front QCD. We proposed a quantum many-body approach to construct the hadronic matrix elements of the energy momentum tensor $T^{++}$ and $T^{+-}$, which are used to extract the gravitational form factors $A(Q^2)$ and $D(Q^2)$. The obtained form factors satisfy the known constraints, e.g. von Laue condition. From these quantities, we also extract the energy, pressure and invariant mass squared distributions of the system. We find that hadrons are multi-layer systems. We also find that there is a tachyonic core within charmonium.</description>

Abstract: Simulating key static and dynamic properties of matter -- from creation in the Big Bang to evolution into sub-atomic and astrophysical environments -- arising from the underlying fundamental quantum fields of the Standard Model and their effective descriptions, lies beyond the capabilities of classical computation alone. Advances in quantum technologies have improved control over quantum entanglement and coherence to the point where robust simulations are anticipated to be possible in the foreseeable future. We discuss the emerging area of quantum simulations of Standard-Model physics, challenges that lie ahead, and opportunities for progress in the context of nuclear and high-energy physics.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of the $U(3) \times U(3)$ extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, the processes $e^+e^- \to K^+K^-\pi^0$ and $e^+e^- \to K^+K^-\eta$ are described taking into account both ground and first radially excited intermediate meson states. It is shown that channels with radially excited $\phi(1680)$ meson are dominant in both processes. The influence on the results of the appearance of phase factors of radially excited intermediate states, the existence of which is indicated by experimental data, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Causal third-order viscous hydrodynamics within relaxation-time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we derive a linearly stable and causal theory of relativistic third-order viscous hydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation with relaxation-time approximation. We employ viscous correction to the distribution function obtained using a Chapman-Enskog like iterative solution of the Boltzmann equation. Our derivation highlights the necessity of incorporating a new dynamical degree of freedom, specifically an irreducible tensors of rank three, within this framework. This differs from the recent formulation of causal third-order theory from the method of moments which requires two dynamical degrees of freedom: an irreducible third-rank and a fourth-rank tensor. We verify the linear stability and causality of the proposed formulation by examining perturbations around a global equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>New Contributions to $b \to s \gamma $ in Minimal G2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the flavor-changing bottom quark radiative decay $b \to s \gamma$ induced at one-loop level within the minimal gauged two-Higgs-doublet model (G2HDM). Among the three new contributions to this rare process in G2HDM, we find that only the charged Higgs $\mathcal{H^\pm}$ contribution can be constrained by the current global fit data in $B$-physics. Other two contributions from the complex vectorial dark matter $\mathcal{W}$ and dark Higgs $\mathcal{D}$ are not sensitive to the current data. Combining with theoretical constraints imposed on the scalar potential and electroweak precision data for the oblique parameters, we exclude mass regions $m_{\mathcal{H}^\pm} \lesssim 250$ GeV and $m_{\mathcal{D}} \lesssim 100$ GeV at the 95\% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Three ways to decipher the nature of exotic hadrons: multiplets, three-body hadronic molecules, and correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past two decades, a plethora of hadronic states beyond the conventional quark model of $q\bar{q}$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons have been observed experimentally, which motivated extensive studies to understand their nature and the non-perturbative strong interaction. Since most of these exotic states are near the mass thresholds of a pair of conventional hadrons, the prevailing picture is that they are primarily hadronic molecules. In principle, one can verify the molecular nature of these states by thoroughly comparing their masses, decay widths, and production rates in a particular picture with experimental data. However, this is difficult or impossible. First, quantum mechanics allows for the mixing of configurations allowed by symmetries and quantum numbers. Second, data are relatively scarce because of their small production rates and the many difficulties in the experimental measurements. As a result, other alternatives need to be explored. This review summarizes three such approaches that can help disentangle the nature of the many exotic hadrons discovered. In the first approach, based on the molecular interpretations for some exotic states, we study the likely existence of multiplets of hadronic molecules related by various symmetries, such as isospin symmetry, SU(3)-flavor symmetry, heavy quark spin/flavor symmetry, and heavy antiquark diquark symmetry. In the second approach, starting from some hadronic molecular candidates, one can derive the underlying hadron-hadron interactions. With these interactions, one can study related three-body systems and check whether three-body bound states/resonances exist. In the third approach, one can turn to the femtoscopy technique to derive the hadron-hadron interactions, hence inaccessible. This technique provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand the interactions between unstable hadrons.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Four Fermion Contact Couplings of a Dark Fermion and an Electron at Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the collider searches and direct detections are promising approaches to probe a fermionic dark matter. In this paper we study signatures of the four fermion contact operators involving a dark fermion, an electron and a quark pair. We show that the mono-electron production channel at hadron collider can provide strong constraints. Associated productions of a charged electron with a photon/jet with missing energy are also studied. Using the current LHC data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$\,TeV, the lower bound on the energy scale of the (axial-)vector operator can reach to $12$\,TeV for a massless dark fermion. It can be further improved to about $24$\,TeV at the HE-LHC with $\sqrt{s} = 25$\,TeV and a total luminosity $20\,{\rm ab}^{-1}$. For the direct detections, the signal operators can generate induced $\beta^\pm$ decays. For the induced $\beta^-$ decay, we show that the constraints are weaker than the ones from the collider searches in almost all of the parameter space, and the accessible parameter space is already excluded by the current LHC data. In case of a relative heavy dark fermion (a few MeV), the induced $\beta^+$ decay is more sensitive than the collider search. Despite the advantage of the collider search that a much wider range of the dark fermion mass can be investigated, it can also provide a complementarity to the detect detections.</description>

      <title>A minimal solution to the axion isocurvature problem from a non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main limitation for pre-inflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is the upper bound on the Hubble rate during inflation from axion isocurvature fluctuations. This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation CMB experiments. We propose a mechanism that excplicitly breaks PQ symmetry via non-minimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the non-minimal coupling, before it moves to its true CP-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance. This scenario can be tested by the combination of next generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD with haloscopes such as ABRACADABRA or CASPEr-Electric.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Clues: DESI, Dark Energy, and the Cosmological Constant Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several attempts to solve the cosmological constant problem, which concerns the value of the cosmological constant being extremely smaller than the Standard Model mass scales, have introduced a scalar field with a very flat potential that can be approximated as linear around any given position. The scalar field scans the cosmological constant in such a way that the current small value is explained. Recently, Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reported the results of the first year. Combining the data with CMB, Pantheon, Union3, and/or DES-SN5YR, there is a preference or anomaly, indicating that the dark energy in the current Universe slightly deviates from that in the $\Lambda$CDM model and varies over time. In this paper, I show that the simple linear potential of a scalar field that may explain the small cosmological constant can explain the DESI anomaly. In particular, the model proposed by the present author in 2108.04246, which relaxes the cosmological constant by the condition that inflation ends, predicts a time-dependence of the dark energy close to the one favored by the data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I derive constraints on the Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory with two massless fermion flavors. Using only general properties of correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears, I prove that in the chiral limit of vanishing quark mass $m$ all the corresponding susceptibilities must be power series in $m^2$ with finite coefficients, from which spectral constraints follow. I then use them to show that effective breaking of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry is allowed in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase in the chiral limit, and leads to distinctive spectral features: (i) the spectral density must develop a singular $m^4/\lambda$ peak as $m\to 0$, (ii) the two-point eigenvalue correlator of near-zero modes must be singular, and (iii) near-zero modes cannot be localized. Moreover, in the symmetric phase the topological charge distribution must be indistinguishable from that of an ideal gas of instantons and anti-instantons of vanishing density, to leading order in the fermion mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that the maximal cut of the equal-mass four-loop banana integral is a period of a family of Calabi-Yau threefolds that depends on the kinematic variable $z=m^2/p^2$. We show that it can also be interpreted as a period of a family of genus-two curves. We do this by introducing a general Calabi-Yau-to-curve correspondence, which in this case locally relates the original period of the family of Calabi-Yau threefolds to a period of a family of genus-two curves that varies holomorphically with the kinematic variable $z$. In addition to working out the concrete details of this correspondence for the equal-mass four-loop banana integral, we outline when we expect a correspondence of this type to hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the speed of light to be a universal speed of propagation of massless carriers. However, other possibilities exist -- including Lorentz-violating theories -- where different fundamental fields travel at different speeds. Black holes are interesting probes of such physics, as distinct fields would probe different horizons. Here, we build an exact spacetime for two interacting scalar fields which have different propagation speeds. One of these fields is able to probe the black hole interior of the other, giving rise to energy extraction from the black hole and a characteristic late-time relaxation. Our results provide further stimulus to the search for extra degrees of freedom, black hole instability, and extra ringdown modes in gravitational-wave events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating primordial black holes (PBHs) is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function with such non-Gaussianities. I also show non-Gaussianity only has mild effects on the induced gravitational waves (GWs), which gives robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational anomaly vertex $\langle TTJ_5\rangle$ (graviton - graviton - axial current) under conditions of finite density and temperature. Through a direct analysis of perturbative contributions, we demonstrate that neither finite temperature nor finite fermion density affects the gravitational chiral anomaly. These results find application in several contexts, from topological materials to the early universe plasma. They affect the decay of any axion or axion-like particle into gravitational waves, in very dense and hot environments.</description>

      <title>From chiral EFT to perturbative QCD: a Bayesian model mixing approach to symmetric nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the complete range of densities between nuclear saturation and an almost-free quark gas with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. In this work, we argue that Bayesian multi-model inference from $\chi$EFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories: we combine the Gaussian random variables that constitute the theories' predictions for the pressure as a function of the density in symmetric nuclear matter. We do this using two Bayesian model mixing procedures: a pointwise approach, and a correlated approach implemented via a Gaussian process (GP), and present results for the pressure and speed of sound in each. The second method produces a smooth $\chi$EFT-to-pQCD EOS. Without input data in the intermediate region, the choice of prior on the EOS, encoded through the GP kernel, as the prior on the EOS function space significantly affects the result in that region. We also discuss future extensions and applications to neutron star matter guided by recent EOS constraints from nuclear theory, nuclear experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor transformation offers a window into the physics of various astrophysical environments, including our Sun and the more exotic environs of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. Here, we apply an inference framework - specifically: statistical data assimilation (SDA) - to neutrino flavor evolution in the Sun. We take a model for solar neutrino flavor evolution, together with Earth-based neutrino measurements, to infer solar properties. Specifically, we ask what signature of the radially-varying solar electron number density $n_e(r)$ is contained within these Earth-based measurements. Currently, the best estimates of $n_e(r)$ come from the standard solar model. We seek to ascertain, through novel application of the SDA method, whether estimates of the same from neutrino data can serve as independent constraints.</description>

Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky function is a central component in the modern formulation of the background field method and the physical applications derived from it. In the present work we report on novel lattice results for this particular quantity, obtained by capitalizing on its equality with the Kugo-Ojima function in the Landau gauge. The results of the lattice simulation are in very good agreement with the predictions derived from a continuum analysis based on the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equations. In addition, we show that an important relation connecting this function with the ghost propagator is fulfilled rather accurately. With the aid of these results, we carry out the first completely lattice-based determination of the process-independent strong running interaction, employed in a variety of phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from false-vacuum islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, much attention has been focused on the false-vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false-vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today. In this paper, we revisit and elaborate on the generations of primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from delayed-decayed false-vacuum islands during asynchronous first-order phase transitions with fitting formulas convenient for future model-independent studies.</description>

      <title>QCD analysis of electromagnetic Dalitz decays $J/\psi\rightarrow\eta^{(\prime)}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.13568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic Dalitz decays $J/\psi\rightarrow\eta^{(\prime)}e^{+}e^{-}$ with large recoil momentum are studied in the framework of perturbative QCD. Meanwhile, the soft contributions from the small recoil momentum region are described by the overlap of soft wave functions, and the resonance contributions are estimated by the vector meson dominance model. Based on this dynamical picture, the transition form factors $f_{\psi\eta^{(\prime)}}(q^{2})$ in full kinematic region are calculated for the first time, and we find that the transition form factors are insensitive to the shapes of $\eta^{(\prime)}$ distribution amplitudes. Our prediction of the normalized transition form factor $F_{\psi \eta}(q^{2})\equiv f_{\psi\eta}(q^{2})/f_{\psi\eta}(0)$ agrees well with its experimental data. In addition, we also find that the branching ratios $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\rightarrow\eta^{(\prime)}e^{+}e^{-})$ are dominated by the contributions of perturbative QCD, and the resonance contributions are negligibly small as well as the soft contributions due to the suppression of the kinematic factor. With all these contributions, our results of the branching ratios $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\rightarrow\eta^{(\prime)}e^{+}e^{-})$ and the ratio $R_{J/\psi}^{e}=\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\rightarrow\eta e^{+}e^{-})/\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\rightarrow\eta^{\prime}e^{+}e^{-})$ are in good agreement with their experimental data. Using the obtained $F_{\psi \eta^{(\prime)}}(q^{2})$, we give the predictions of the branching ratios $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\rightarrow\eta^{(\prime)}\mu^{+}\mu^{-})$ and their ratio $R_{J/\psi}^{\mu}$.</description>

Abstract: Measurement of cosmic photons may reveal their propagation in the interstellar environment, thereby offering a promising way to probe axions and axion-like particles (ALPs). Numerical methods are usually used to compute the propagation of the photon-ALP beam due to the complexity of both the interstellar magnetic field and the evolution equation. However, under certain conditions, the evolution equation can be greatly simplified so that the photon-ALP propagation can be analytically solved. By using analytic methods, we find two distinct photon-ALP propagation modes, determined by the relative magnitude of the photon-ALP mixing term in comparison to the photon attenuation term. In one mode, the intensity of photons decreases with the increasing distance; in the other mode, it also exhibits oscillatory behavior. To distinguish the two propagation modes, we compute the observable quantities such as the photon survival probability and the degree of polarization.</description>

      <title>PCN: A Deep Learning Approach to Jet Tagging Utilizing Novel Graph Construction Methods and Chebyshev Graph Convolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet tagging is a classification problem in high-energy physics experiments that aims to identify the collimated sprays of subatomic particles, jets, from particle collisions and tag them to their emitter particle. Advances in jet tagging present opportunities for searches of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Current approaches use deep learning to uncover hidden patterns in complex collision data. However, the representation of jets as inputs to a deep learning model have been varied, and often, informative features are withheld from models. In this study, we propose a graph-based representation of a jet that encodes the most information possible. To learn best from this representation, we design Particle Chebyshev Network (PCN), a graph neural network (GNN) using Chebyshev graph convolutions (ChebConv). ChebConv has been demonstrated as an effective alternative to classical graph convolutions in GNNs and has yet to be explored in jet tagging. PCN achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing taggers and opens the door to future studies into graph-based representations of jets and ChebConv layers in high-energy physics experiments. Code is available at https://github.com/YVSemlani/PCN-Jet-Tagging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the NFLikelihood, an unsupervised version, based on Normalizing Flows, of the DNNLikelihood proposed in Ref.[1]. We show, through realistic examples, how Autoregressive Flows, based on affine and rational quadratic spline bijectors, are able to learn complicated high-dimensional Likelihoods arising in High Energy Physics (HEP) analyses. We focus on a toy LHC analysis example already considered in the literature and on two Effective Field Theory fits of flavor and electroweak observables, whose samples have been obtained throught the HEPFit code. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the unsupervised approach with respect to the supervised one and discuss possible interplays of the two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mathematical framework for constructing the most general neutrino mass matrices that yield the observed spectrum of light active neutrino masses in conjunction with arbitrarily many heavy sterile neutrinos, without the need to assume a hierarchy between Dirac and Majorana mass terms. The seesaw mechanism is a byproduct of the formalism, along with many other possibilities for generating tiny neutrino masses. We comment on phenomenological applications of this approach, in particular deriving a mechanism to address the long-standing $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly in the context of the left-right symmetric model.</description>

      <title>Kinematical higher-twist corrections in $\gamma^* \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$: Charged meson production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) of mesons can be probed by the reactions $e^- e^+ \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, which are accessible at electron-positron colliders such as BESIII and Belle II. After discussing the neutral meson production case in the first paper of this series \cite{Pire:2023kng}, we discuss here the complementary case of the charged meson ($M^+ M^-$) production, where one can extract the complete information on GDAs from the interference of the amplitudes of the two competing processes where the photon is emitted either in the initial or in the final state. Considering the importance of the charged meson production, we present a complete expression for the interference term of the cross section which is experimentally accessible thanks to its charge conjugation specific property. We adopt two types of models for leading twist $\pi \pi$ GDAs to estimate the size of the interference term in the process $e^- e^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^- \gamma$ numerically, namely a model extracted from previous experimental results on $\gamma^* \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ at Belle and the asymptotic form predicted by QCD evolution equations. We include in the calculation the kinematical power suppressed (sometimes called kinematical higher-twist) corrections up to $1/Q^2$ for the helicity amplitudes. Both models of GDAs indicate that the kinematical corrections are not negligible for the interference term of the cross section measured at BESIII, thus it is necessary to include them if we try to extract the GDAs precisely. On the other side, the kinematical corrections are very tiny for the measurements at Belle II, and the leading twist-2 formula of the interference term will be good enough to describe the charge conjugation odd part of the differential cross section.</description>

      <title>Light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter with gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ version of the light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter. The $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry provides a UV completion by naturally accommodating three right handed neutrinos from anomaly cancellation requirements which, in combination with the left handed neutrinos, form the sub-eV Dirac neutrinos after electroweak symmetry breaking. The particle content and the gauge charges are chosen in such a way that light neutrinos remain purely Dirac and dark matter, a gauge singlet Dirac fermion, remain stable. We consider both thermal and non-thermal production possibilities of dark matter and correlate the corresponding parameter space with the one within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments sensitive to enhanced relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. The interplay of dark matter, CMB, structure formation and other terrestrial constraints keep the scenario very predictive leading the $U(1)_{B-L}$ parameter space into tight corners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $P$-wave charmonium electromagnetic Dalitz decays $h_{c}\rightarrow\eta^{(\prime)}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ $(\ell=e, \mu)$ with large recoil momentum are investigated in the framework of perturbative QCD, and the contributions from the small recoil momentum region are described by the overlap of soft wave functions. The transition form factors $f_{h_{c}\eta^{(\prime)}}(q^{2})$ and the normalized transition form factors $F_{h_{c} \eta^{(\prime)}}(q^{2})$ in full kinematic region are derived for the first time. It is noticed that there are no IR divergences at one-loop level, and the transition form factors with the relativistic corrections from the internal momentum of $h_{c}$ are insensitive to both the shapes of $\eta^{(\prime)}$ distribution amplitudes and the invariant mass of the lepton pair in the large recoil momentum region. Intriguingly, unlike the situation in the $S$-wave charmonium decays $J/\psi\rightarrow\eta^{(\prime)}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$, we find the contributions from the small recoil momentum region are comparable with those from the large recoil momentum region in the $P$-wave charmonium decays $h_{c}\rightarrow\eta^{(\prime)}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$. By employing the obtained $F_{h_{c} \eta^{(\prime)}}(q^{2})$, we give the predictions of the branching ratios $\mathcal{B}(h_{c}\rightarrow\eta^{(\prime)}\ell^{+}\ell^{-})$, which may come within the range of measurement of present or near-future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the mass spectra of the P-wave fully charm and fully bottom tetraquark states in the framework of QCD sum rules. We construct the interpolating currents by inserting the covariant derivative operator $\overset{ \leftrightarrow } { \mathcal D }_{ \mu }$ between the S-wave diquark and antidiquark fields. The excitation structures show that the pure $\lambda$-mode excited P-wave fully heavy tetraquarks exist for the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{--}, 1^{-+}, 2^{--}, 2^{-+}$ and $3^{--}$, while it is difficult to separate the $\lambda$-mode and $\rho$-mode excitations in the $0^{-+}$ channel. Within three Lorentz indices, there is no pure $\lambda$-mode excited P-wave fully charm/bottom tetraquark operators with $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ and $3^{-+}$. Our results support that the recent observed $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$ resonances could be interpreted as the P-wave fully charm $cc \bar c \bar c$ tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{-+}$, respectively. Some P-wave fully bottom $bb\bar b\bar b$ tetraquark states are predicted to be lower than the di-$\eta_b(1S)$ and di-$\Upsilon(1S)$ mass thresholds. Hopefully our calculations will be useful for identifying the nature of new exotic tetraquark states.</description>

Abstract: Built on the seminal works by Jackson-Treiman-Wyld and Ebel-Feldman, we derive the most general free neutron differential decay rate where all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) are polarized. This introduces 33 new correlations in addition to the 18 existing ones, which over-constrain the coupling constants in the low-energy effective field theory of charged weak interactions, and thus provides stringent tests of the validity of the theory framework itself. We classify the correlation coefficients in terms of their Standard Model limit and discrete symmetries, and study their expansion with respect to the new physics coupling strengths, supplemented by the experiment-independent $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ virtual electromagnetic radiative corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decade, an increasing number of datasets have revealed a consistent discrepancy between the number of muons measured in ultra-high-energy extensive air showers (EAS) and the numbers predicted by simulations. This gap persists despite incorporating Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data into the tuning of current hadronic interaction models, leading to the phenomenon often termed the ''muon puzzle''. To gain a deeper understanding of the potential origins of this muon puzzle, we have developed Sibyll$^{\bigstar}$, a series of phenomenologically modified versions of Sibyll 2.3d. In these models, we have increased muon production by altering $\rho^0$, baryon-antibaryon pair, or kaon production in hadronic multiparticle production processes. These variants remain within bounds from provided by accelerator measurements, including those from the LHC and fixed-target experiments, notably NA49 and NA61, showing a level of consistency comparable to Sibyll 2.3d. Our findings show that these modifications can increase the muon count in EAS by up to 35%, while minimally affecting the depth of shower maximum ($X_{\rm max}$) and other shower variables. Additionally, we assess the impact of these modifications on various observables, including inclusive muon and neutrino fluxes and the multiplicities of muon bundles in deep underground and water/ice Cherenkov detectors. We aim for at least one of these model variants to offer a more accurate representation of EAS data at the highest energies, thereby enhancing the quality of Monte Carlo predictions used in training neural networks. This improvement is crucial for achieving more reliable data analyses and interpretations.</description>

      <title>QCD-Compatible Supermassive Inert Top-Down Holographic Mesinos at Intermediate Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A longstanding problem with the popular Sakai-Sugimoto holographic dual of thermal QCD is that the "mesinos", the (non-supersymmetric) fermionic partners of the mesons, are nearly isospectral with mesons and have an unsuppressed mesino-meson interaction, both being in contradiction with actual QCD. We solve this problem in a UV-complete (and ${\it different}$) type IIA string dual ${\it at\ intermediate\ coupling}$ of realistic thermal QCD, in which the mesinos are shown to be much heavier than and non-interacting with mesons (the wave-function/mass/interaction terms receiving no ${\cal M}$-theory ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections). In particular we derive a large-$N$ enhancement of the KK mass scale $M_{KK}$ (from $M_{KK}$ to $M_{KK}^{\rm eff}\sim N^{1 + \frac{1}{{\cal O}(1)}}M_{KK}$) arising from the construction of the type IIA mirror \cite{MQGP} of the type IIB dual \cite{metrics} of thermal QCD-like theories, as well as the generation of a one-parameter family of $M_{KK}$-independent mass scale at ${\cal O}(R^4)$ in the ${\cal M}$-theory uplift \cite{OR4} wherein the parameter can be made appropriately large. We also show that the mesino-mesino-single-($\rho/\pi$)meson interactions, vanish identically in the aforementioned type IIA holographic dual.</description>

Abstract: We study the correlator of temporal Wilson lines at non-zero temperature in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD with the aim to define the heavy quark-antiquark potential at non-zero temperature. For temperatures $153~{\rm MeV} \leq T \leq 352~{\rm MeV}$ the spectral representation of this correlator is consistent with a broadened peak in the spectral function, position or width of which then defines the real or imaginary parts of the heavy quark-antiquark potential at non-zero temperature, respectively. We find that the potential's real part is not screened contrary to the widely-held expectations. We comment on how this fact may modify the picture of quarkonium melting in the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of upcoming 21-cm surveys of cosmic dawn ($12\lesssim \!z\lesssim\!30$) to provide cosmological information on top of upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure surveys, such as CMB-S4, Simons Observatory (SO) and DESI. We focus on the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$ which is a promising observable for probing beyond the Standard Model theories. We show including upcoming 21-cm surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) can allow probing a wide range of models for light particles at $2\sigma$ level achieving $2\sigma(N_{\rm eff})=0.034$ with CMB-S4, for example. Taking into account the degeneracy between $N_{\rm eff}$ and primordial helium fraction $Y_p$, one can achieve improvements in sensitivities to cosmological parameters, in particular, by more than a factor of 2 for $N_{\rm eff}$ and dark matter fractional energy density $\omega_c$.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Spectral Method: From Atomic Orbitals to Classical Self-Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can classical systems be described analytically at all orders in their interaction strength? For periodic and approximately periodic systems, the answer is yes, as we show in this work. Our analytical approach, which we call the \textit{Quantum Spectral Method}, is based on a novel application of Bohr's correspondence principle, obtaining non-perturbative classical dynamics as the classical limit of \textit{quantum matrix elements}. A major application of our method is the calculation of self-force as the classical limit of atomic radiative transitions. We demonstrate this by calculating an adiabatic electromagnetic inspiral, along with its associated radiation, at all orders in the multipole expansion. Finally, we propose a future application of the QSM to compute scalar and gravitational self-force in Schwarzschild, analytically.</description>

      <title>Superallowed nuclear beta decays and precision tests of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many decades, the main source of information on the top-left corner element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix $V_{ud}$ were superallowed nuclear beta decays with an impressive 0.01\% precision. This precision, apart from experimental data, relies on theoretical calculations in which nuclear structure-dependent effects and uncertainties play a prime role. This review is dedicated to a thorough reassessment of all ingredients that enter the extraction of the value of $V_{ud}$ from experimental data. We tried to keep balance between historical retrospect and new developments, many of which occurred in just five past years. They have not yet been reviewed in a complete manner, not least because new results are a-coming. This review aims at filling this gap and offers an in-depth yet accessible summary of all recent developments.</description>

      <title>Pole-Skipping and Chaos in Hot ${\cal M}$QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question of whether thermal QCD at high temperature is chaotic from the ${\cal M}$ theory dual of QCD-like theories at intermediate coupling as constructed in arXiv: 2004.07259. The equations of motion of the gauge-invariant combination $Z_s(r)$ of scalar metric perturbations is shown to possess an irregular singular point at the horizon radius $r_h$. Very interestingly, at a specific value of the imaginary frequency and momentum used to read off the analogs of the ''Lyapunov exponent'' $\lambda_L$ and ''butterfly velocity'' $v_b$ not only does $r_h$ become a regular singular point, but truncating the incoming mode solution of $Z_s(r)$ as a power series around $r_h$, yields a ''missing pole'', i.e., $C_{n, n+1}=0,\ {\rm det}\ M^{(n)}=0, n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ is satisfied for a single $n\geq3$ depending on the values of the string coupling $g_s$, number of (fractional) $D3$ branes $(M)N$ and flavor $D7$-branes $N_f$ in the parent type IIB set (arXiv:hep-th/0902.1540), e.g., for the QCD(EW-scale)-inspired $N=100, M=N_f=3, g_s=0.1$, one finds a missing pole at $n=3$. For integral $n&gt;3$, truncating $Z_s(r)$ at ${\cal O}((r-r_h)^n)$, yields $C_{n, n+1}=0$ at order $n,\ \forall n\geq3$. Incredibly, (assuming preservation of isotropy in $\mathbb{R}^3$ even with the inclusion of higher derivative corrections) the aforementioned gauge-invariant combination of scalar metric perturbations receives no ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections. Hence, (the aforementioned analogs of) $\lambda_L, v_b$ are unrenormalized up to ${\cal O}(R^4)$ in ${\cal M}$ theory.</description>

      <title>Shallow Bound States and Hints for Broad Resonances with Quark Content $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ in $B$-$\bar{D}$ and $B^*$-$\bar{D}$ Scattering from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the energy dependence of the $B$-$\bar{D}$ and $B^*$-$\bar{D}$ isospin-0, $S$-wave scattering amplitudes both below and above the thresholds using lattice QCD, which allows us to investigate rigorously whether mixed bottom-charm $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ tetraquarks exist as bound states or resonances. The scattering phase shifts are obtained using L\"uscher's method from the energy spectra in two different volumes. To ensure that no relevant energy level is missed, we use large, symmetric $7 \times 7$ and $8 \times 8$ correlation matrices that include, at both source and sink, $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{D}$ scattering operators with the lowest three or four possible back-to-back momenta in addition to local $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ operators. We fit the energy dependence of the extracted scattering phase shifts using effective-range expansions. We observe sharp peaks in the $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{D}$ scattering rates close to the thresholds, which are associated with shallow bound states, either genuine or virtual, a few MeV or less below the $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{D}$ thresholds. In addition, we find hints for resonances with masses of order $100$ MeV above the thresholds and decay widths of order $200$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Non-hydrodynamic response in QCD-like plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quark-gluon plasma's (QGP) properties at non-hydrodynamic and non-perturbative regimes remain largely unexplored. Here, we examine the response functions describing how a QGP-like plasma responds to initial energy-momentum disturbance in both static and Bjorken-expanding plasma at non-hydrodynamic gradient using the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). We show that the resulting response functions are remarkably similar in both static and expanding backgrounds at non-hydrodynamic gradients. While non-hydrodynamic response can not be described by the conventional first-order and second-order theories, its behavior is reasonably captured by the extended version of hydrodynamics proposed by us (arXiv: 2208.01046). The potential sensitivity of the Euclidean correlator to non-hydrodynamic response is also illustrated.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Lorentz-violating Casimir effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider the four-dimensional Maxwell electrodynamics extended with CPT-even Myers-Pospelov Lorentz-violating dimension-six operators to investigate the associated two-dimensional properties in the context of quantum vacuum fluctuation effects, namely, the Casimir effect. Upon projecting out the 4D theory down to a 2D theory we obtain analogs of these operators leading to a modified dispersion relation in a Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) scalar model equivalent to the electromagnetic theory. By making use of the modified dispersion relation, we derive exact analytic expressions for the Casimir energy and force induced by imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on the scalar field. In the regime where the LIV parameter becomes very small, we recover known results for the Casimir energy and force plus correction terms due to the LIV.</description>

      <title>Engineering and Revealing Dirac Strings in Spinor Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial monopoles have been engineered in various systems, yet there has been no systematic study of the singular vector potentials associated with the monopole field. We show that the Dirac string, the line singularity of the vector potential, can be engineered, manipulated, and made manifest in a spinor atomic condensate. We elucidate the connection among spin, orbital degrees of freedom, and the artificial gauge, and show that there exists a mapping between the vortex filament and the Dirac string. We also devise a proposal where preparing initial spin states with relevant symmetries can result in different vortex patterns, revealing an underlying correspondence between the internal spin states and the spherical vortex structures. Such a mapping also leads to a new way of constructing spherical Landau levels, and monopole harmonics. Our observation provides insights into the behavior of quantum matter possessing internal symmetries in curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in the current cosmological data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.</description>
