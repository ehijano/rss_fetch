      <title>Red blood cell partitioning and segregation through vascular bifurcations in a model of sickle cell disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of cell segregation and margination in blood disorders on microcirculatory hemodynamics within bifurcated vessels are physiologically significant, yet poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive computational investigation of red blood cell (RBC) suspension dynamics, with a focus on a model of sickle cell disease (SCD) as an example of a disorder associated with subpopulations of aberrant RBCs. The findings reveal how cell margination influences cellular partitioning and distributions as well as vessel wall shear stress (WSS) at vascular bifurcations. Normal RBCs, which migrate toward the channel center, exhibit the Zweifach-Fung effect, preferentially entering high-flow-rate branches. In contrast, sickle cells, which marginate near the vessel wall, demonstrate an anti-Zweifach-Fung effect, favoring lower-flow-rate branches due to their position within the cell-free layer (CFL). The upstream segregation of cells remains downstream through the bifurcation, where sickle cells accumulate along the outer branch walls. This accumulation of sickle cells increases the frequency of high WSS events via direct physical interactions, particularly on the outer side of high-velocity branches, potentially contributing to the vascular damage and endothelial disruption observed in many disorders that affect RBCs. In geometrically asymmetric bifurcations, cells preferentially enter branches with larger radii, underscoring the influence of geometric complexity on microcirculatory blood flow. These findings provide insights into microvascular hemodynamics in SCD and other blood disorders.</description>

      <title>Electrokinetic Flow Modeling Through Bone Scaffold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid flow and mass transfer inside a bioreactor play a pivotal role in growing bone grafts, as cell proliferation is limited by the transport of nutrients and oxygen, as well as the removal of by-products from cells within the scaffold. Traditionally, perfusion bioreactors are used for tissue-engineered bone grafts. In this study, we modeled electrokinetic flow through the graft for tissue-engineered bone grafts and compared it to pressure-driven flows. The study highlights that electrokinetic transport offers several advantages over pressure-driven flow, such as improved oxygen transport and higher shear stress. Additionally, it provides generic benefits, including greater flexibility in control mechanisms, such as easier actuation and manipulation of flow.</description>

      <title>Real-Time, Label-free Electrical Transduction of Catalytic Events in a Single-Protein Redox Enzymatic Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-enzyme catalysis offers a promising approach for unravelling the dynamic behaviour of individual enzymes as they undergo a reaction, revealing the complex heterogeneity that is lost in the averaged ensembles. Here we demonstrate real-time, label-free monitoring of the electrical transduction of single-protein enzymatic activity for two redox enzymes, cytochrome P450cam and glutathione reductase, trapped in an electrochemically controlled nanoscale tunnelling junction immersed in the aqueous enzymatic mixture. The conductance switching signal observed in individual transients of the electrical current flowing through the single-protein junction shows that the tunnelling conductance is modulated by the enzymatic reaction; subtle changes of the enzyme redox state occurring during the chemical catalysis process result in fluctuations of the enzyme junction conductivity, which are captured as a switching signal. At the applied electrochemical reducing potential for electrocatalysis, the transient oxidation of the trapped enzyme in every catalytic cycle opens an additional redox-mediated electron tunnelling channel in the single protein junction that results in a temporary current jump, contributing to the observed conductance switching features. The latter is experimentally assessed via electrochemically controlled conductance measurements of the single-protein junction. The statistical analysis of the switching events captured over long time periods results in average frequencies that correlate well with the reported catalytic turnover values of both enzymes obtained in standard bulk assays. The single-enzyme experiments reveal the acute heterogenous behaviour of enzymatic catalysis and the quantification of single enzyme turnover frequencies.</description>

      <title>Automatic partitioning for the low-rank integration of stochastic Boolean reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean reaction networks are an important tool in biochemistry for studying mechanisms in the biological cell. However, the stochastic formulation of such networks requires the solution of a master equation which inherently suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In the past, the dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation has been repeatedly used to solve high-dimensional reaction networks by separating the network into smaller partitions. However, the partitioning of these networks was so far only done by hand. In this paper, we present a heuristic, automatic partitioning scheme based on two ingredients: the Kernighan-Lin algorithm and information entropy. Our approach is computationally inexpensive and can be easily incorporated as a preprocessing step into the existing simulation workflow. We test our scheme by partitioning Boolean reaction networks on a single level and also in a hierarchical fashion with tree tensor networks. The resulting accuracy of the scheme is superior to both partitionings chosen by human experts and those found by simply minimizing the number of reaction pathways between partitions.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modelling of Mechanotransduction via RhoA Signalling Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive and simulate a mathematical model for mechanotransduction related to the Rho GTPase signalling pathway. The model addresses the bidirectional coupling between signalling processes and cell mechanics. A numerical method based on bulk-surface finite elements is proposed for the approximation of the coupled system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, defined inside the cell and on the cell membrane, and the equations of elasticity. Our simulation results illustrate novel emergent features such as the strong dependence of the dynamics on cell shape, a threshold-like response to changes in substrate stiffness, and the fact that coupling mechanics and signalling can lead to the robustness of cell deformation to larger changes in substrate stiffness, ensuring mechanical homeostasis in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing kidney quality assessment: Power Doppler during normothermic machine perfusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Marginal donor kidneys are increasingly used for transplantation to overcome organ shortage. This study aims to investigate the additional value of Power Doppler (PD) imaging in kidney quality assessment during normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Methods: Porcine kidneys (n=22) retrieved from a local slaughterhouse underwent 2 hours of NMP. Based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) and oxygen consumption (VO2), the kidneys were classified as functional (n=7) and non-functional (n=15) kidneys. PD imaging was performed at 30, 60, and 120 minutes, and PD metrics, including vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) were calculated. Renal blood flow (RBF), CrCl, and VO2 were measured at the same time points during NMP. The metrics were compared utilizing correlation analysis. Results: FI and VFI moderately correlated with CrCl (r=0.537, p&lt;0.0001; r=0.536, p&lt;0.0001, respectively), while VI strongly correlated with VO2 (r=0.839, p&lt;0.0001). At 120 minutes, PD metrics demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing functional from non-functional kidneys, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.943 for VI, 0.924 for FI, and 0.943 for VFI. Cutoff values of 17% for VI, 50 a.u. for FI, and 9 a.u. for VFI provided 100% specificity and 73% sensitivity to identify non-functional kidneys, with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 82%. Baseline kidney biopsies showed moderate acute tubular necrosis in both groups with no significant differences. Conclusions: PD metrics strongly correlate with renal viability and effectively differentiate functional from non-functional kidneys. PD imaging can be a valuable alternative to RBF during NMP for kidney assessment.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity increases transition path probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defining low-dimensional reaction coordinates is crucial for analyzing the dynamics of complex systems and for comparison with experiments. The maximal value of the transition-path probability along the reaction coordinate $x$, $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$, is a common estimator for reaction-coordinate quality by comparing to the theoretical maximal value of 1/2 in the overdamped Markovian limit. We show by analytical arguments and simulations that for non-Markovian dynamics $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$ is non-monotonic as a function of the memory time and exceeds 1/2 for long memory time. This disqualifies $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$ as a criterion for reaction coordinate quality.</description>

      <title>The importance of being discrete -- An agent-based model for active nematics and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems are composed of discrete units, assembled through a hierarchy of structures, and active, by locally extracting energy from their environment to produce mechanical work. Hydrodynamic theories have been successfully applied to describe the large scale dynamics of active materials. Yet, the hydrodynamic limit requires a separation of scales which is not necessarily fulfilled among living systems. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based model of flexible rods exchanging active force dipoles with nematic symmetry, allowing us to explore their behavior down to the sub-agent scale. We obtain spontaneous flows and self-propulsion of $+1/2$ topological defects, hallmarks of the hydrodynamic theory of active nematics, even on scales smaller than the individual agent! Moreover, our results go beyond the hydrodynamic framework, identifying novel correlations between orientation and flows or strong asymmetries between contractile and extensile activity. Finally, we show the versatility of our agent-based model by presenting spontaneous flows in three dimensions and nematic tissue growth. Because living systems like cell tissues often exhibit several sources of activity, our framework opens the way for more integrated descriptions of living materials.</description>

      <title>Broadband ptychographic imaging for biological samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ptychography is an attractive advance of coherent diffraction imaging (CDI), which can provide high lateral resolution and wide field of view. The theoretical resolution of ptychography is dose-limited, therefore making ptychography workable with a broadband source will be highly beneficial. However, broad spectra of light source conflict with the high coherence assumption in CDI that the current reconstruction algorithm were built upon. In this paper, we demonstrated that incorporation of a blind deconvolution in the reconstruction algorithm can improve the image quality of ptychography with broadband source. This broadband reconstruction algorithm can obtain high-quality amplitude and phase images of complex-valued samples requiring no knowledge of the illumination spectrum. Optical experiments using biological samples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The significant improvement in low coherence tolerance by our approach can pave the way for implementing ultrafast imaging with femtosecond or attosecond lasers or high-flux ptychographic imaging with laboratory EUV or X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale properties of biomolecular condensates emerging from protein chain dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-Resolution Microscopy (SRM) is emerging as a powerful and innovative tool for imaging, characterizing, and understanding the structure of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs). By addressing the need for single-particle analysis with the high resolution required to study the composition and organization of these nanoparticles, SRM provides unique insights into EV biology. However, its application is accompanied by significant challenges, ranging from experimental setup to data analysis. This review outlines the fundamentals of SRM and its position within the broader field of EV research. We then explore its applications in evaluating (i) the morphological structure of EVs, (ii) their molecular composition, and (iii) their roles in biological systems. By offering practical guidance and an overview of critical parameters for standardization, this review aims at providing researchers with the tools and insights necessary to effectively apply SRM to EV investigation.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation from the IFCN-endorsed ITRUSST Consortium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-intensity Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation (TUS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique enabling cortical and deep brain targeting with unprecedented spatial accuracy. Given the high rate of adoption by new users with varying levels of expertise and interdisciplinary backgrounds, practical guidelines are needed to ensure state-of-the-art TUS application and reproducible outcomes. Therefore, the International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards (ITRUSST) consortium has formed a subcommittee, endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN), to develop recommendations for best practice in TUS applications in humans. The practical guide presented here provides a brief introduction into ultrasound physics and sonication parameters. It explains the requirements of TUS lab equipment and transducer selection and discusses experimental design and procedures alongside potential confounds and control conditions. Finally, the guide elaborates on essential steps of application planning for stimulation safety and efficacy, as well as considerations when combining TUS with neuroimaging, electrophysiology, or other brain stimulation techniques. We hope that this practical guide to TUS will assist both novice and experienced users in planning and conducting high-quality studies and provide a solid foundation for further advancements in this promising field.</description>

      <title>Approximations of MINFLUX Localization Precision with Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MINFLUX is an emerging super-resolution technology that measures the position of single fluorophores with nanometer precision using fewer photons than any other fluorescence imaging or tracking technique. Here, we derive simple and instructive analytical equations for MINFLUX localization precision with a special focus on background photons. A fluorescence background, either arising from an imperfect zero of the MINFLUX excitation point spread function (PSF) or from auto- or out-of-focus fluorescence, ultimately limits the resolution achievable with MINFLUX. Building on previous work, we try to improve our understanding of the influence of background, especially when it is unknown, through a new set of expressions for the localization precision, based on an explicit background term instead of signal-to-background ratio. We use these equations to generate an intuitive understanding of how fluorescence background affects MINFLUX measurements and illustrate that:
  - The precision of an emitter position estimate depends on the gradient of its excitation profile.
  - Knowledge of the fluorescence background, obtained during post-processing of MINFLUX traces or through separate measurements, provides a better localization precision than in the case of unknown background.
  - In diffraction-limited systems, localization with a PSF that features a near-zero minimum outperforms localization with a maximum.
  We also present an analytical expression for the localization precision in orbital tracking, which we use for comparison to MINFLUX.</description>
