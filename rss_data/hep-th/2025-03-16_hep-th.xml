      <title>Quantum complexity in gravity, quantum field theory, and quantum information science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state, or implementing a unitary, using limited resources. Over the past decade, quantum-complexity research has surged. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter and quantum gravity. Different communities apply different tools to quantum complexity, as well as define complexity differently. This review bridges the disciplines' approaches. We cover multiple definitions of complexity, as well as their key properties and applications. In quantum information, random quantum circuits proved to be an invaluable tool in extracting properties of the complexity growth of discrete quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), complexity is defined geometrically through geodesics. Complexity can be defined also in terms of state or operator spreading and tensor-network concepts. In addition to reviewing these approaches, we outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models and QFTs, including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we detail the relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the anti-de Sitter-space (AdS)/CFT correspondence. This review thereby integrates recent quantum-complexity advances across fields.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Higher-Spin Gauge Theories in any $d$ and their Coupling Constants within BRST Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear field equations for the supersymmetric higher-spin gauge theory describing totally symmetric bosonic and fermionic massless fields along with hook-type bosonic fields of all spins in any space-time dimension are presented. One of the novel features of the proposed formalism is that the $osp(1,2)$ invariance and factorisation conditions are formulated within the BRST formalism, that greatly simplifies the form of nonlinear HS equations. To match the list of vertices found by Metsaev, higher-spin gauge theory is anticipated to possess an infinite number of independent coupling constants. A conjecture that these coupling constants result from the locality restrictions on the elements of the factorisation ideal is put forward.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by non-self-intersecting vortons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact solutions to the Nambu-Goto equations for thin vortons stabilized by chiral currents. The solutions describe a class of non-self-intersecting, stationary loops with arbitrary shapes. In addition to the trivial circular and the Kibble-Turok vortons, we also derive a two-parameter family that incorporates the first, second, and third harmonic modes. We found that, in general, the vorton's constraints allow for constructing families of solutions with arbitrary harmonic modes. We further investigate the gravitational lensing effects associated with these solutions under the weak-field and thin-lens approximations. For circular vortons, the lensing exhibits a sharp discontinuity separating two regions with distinctly different distortions. The corresponding Einstein ring co-exist alongside an almost undistorted source image. This effect is significantly amplified in the case of non-circular vortons, highlighting their potential observational signatures.</description>

      <title>c-theorem and improvement in non-compact conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-momentum tensor in general conformal field theories have improvement ambiguity and it can affect the argument in deriving $c$-theorem. While the derivation of Zamolodchikov's c-theorem is still formally valid with the improved energy-momentum tensor, the behavior of the c-function proposed by Zamolodchikov becomes different. When the theory suffers an IR divergence due to the non-compactness, the $c$-function can be unbounded and may even show non-monotonicity. We find that one of the three-point function sum rule proposed by Hartman and Mathys motivated by the averaged null energy condition, however, is agnostic about the improvement and gives the (effective) Virasoro central charge, when the IR theory is gapped.</description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we demonstrate that SVD fails to correctly reproduce the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Growth of Cosmic Strings beyond Kination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel mechanism for the production of a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed in the context of a kinating background driven by the volume modulus of string compactifications. In this paper, we generalise the analysis of this growth mechanism by using dynamical system techniques. We first study the cosmological growth of strings in a spatially-flat Universe filled with a perfect fluid and a field-dependent tension, finding the fixed points of the phase space of this system. We then apply this analysis to fundamental strings and EFT strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$-cycles. We find a cosmological growth for fundamental strings even without kination, as in scaling fixed points, and for EFT strings arising from D3- and NS5-branes wrapped around fibration cycles.</description>

      <title>The Fierz-Pauli theory on curved spacetime at one-loop and its counterterms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the first four heat-kernel coefficients required for the renormalization of Linearized Massive Gravity. We focus on the Fierz-Pauli theory in a curved spacetime, describing the propagation of a massive spin $2$ field in a non-flat background. The background must be on-shell, i.e. must be an Einstein space, in order to ensure a consistent extension of the Fierz-Pauli theory beyond Minkowski space. Starting from the St\"uckelberg formulation with restored gauge invariance, we apply suitable gauge-fixing procedures to simplify the complicated non-minimal kinetic operators of the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors of the theory, reducing them into manageable minimal forms. Using standard techniques, we then compute the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients, with particular emphasis on the fourth coefficient, $a_3(D)$, in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. This result constitutes our main contribution, as it has not been previously reported in full generality in the literature.</description>

      <title>Holographic Description of Bulk Wave Packets in AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the study of wave packets from the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence to AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ and examine properties of their energy density. We find that, while the energy still localizes on the light cone, its spatial distribution exhibits momentum dependence and is no longer localized in higher dimensions. This result is significant as it reflects leading $1/N$ corrections to the generalized free field theory associated with the free bulk theory at $N=\infty$. Our findings are consistent with previous studies on entanglement wedge reconstruction including $1/N$ corrections, and also provide new insights into the structure of wave packets in higher-dimensional holography.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of point particle's dynamics on higher-spin backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the light-cone gauge formalism to study interactions of point particles with chiral higher-spin fields. By analysing the light-cone consistency conditions at the subleading order in higher-spin fields, we find that no local interactions of point particles with chiral higher-spin fields are possible. Considering that chiral higher-spin theories form inevitable closed subsectors of any consistent higher-spin theories in flat space, this conclusion holds more generally, in particular, it applies to putative parity-invariant completions of chiral higher-spin theories. Besides that, we argue that our result implies that Riemannian geometry cannot be extended to spaces with non-trivial higher-spin fields, in particular, there is no higher-spin extension of space-time interval. In the present paper we focus on a case of a massless particle, while a more technical massive case will be analysed in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss various sphaleron-like solutions on $\mathbb{S}^1$. These solutions are static, but unstable. We explore possible stabilization mechanisms based on the excitation of internal modes. Additionally, we observe that, on time scales comparable to the size of the circle, the collapse of large sphalerons mimics the kink-antikink scattering on the real line.</description>

      <title>Primordial Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from a Sharp Feature in Three-field Inflation II: The Inflationary Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09023v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the contribution of large scalar perturbations sourced by a sharp feature during cosmic inflation to the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), extending our previous work to include the SGWB sourced during the inflationary era. We focus in particular on three-field inflation, since the third dynamical field is the first not privileged by the perturbations' equations of motion and allows a more direct generalization to $N$-field inflation. For the first time, we study the three-field isocurvature perturbations sourced during the feature and include the effects of isocurvature masses. In addition to a two-field limit, we find that the third field's dynamics during the feature can source large isocurvature transients which then later decay, leaving an inflationary-era-sourced SGWB as their only observable signature. We find that the inflationary-era signal shape near the peak is largely independent of the number of dynamical fields and has a greatly enhanced amplitude sourced by the large isocurvature transient, suppressing the radiation-era contribution and opening a new window of detectable parameter space with small adiabatic enhancement. The largest enhancements we study could easily violate backreaction constraints, but much of parameter space remains under perturbative control. These SGWBs could be visible in LISA and other gravitational wave experiments, leaving an almost universal signature of sharp features during multi-field inflation, even when the sourcing isocurvature decays to unobservability shortly afterwards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve an open problem in spectral geometry: the construction of finite-dimensional, discrete geometries coordinatized by non-simple, exceptional Jordan algebras. The approach taken is readily generalisable to broad classes of nonassociative geometries, opening the door to the spectral geometric desciption of gauge theories with exceptional symmetries. We showcase a proof-of-principle 2-point geometry corresponding to the internal space of an $F_4 \times F_4$ gauge theory with scalar content restricted by novel conditions arising from the associative properties of the coordinate algebra. We then formally establish a setting for generalising to n-point exceptional Jordan geometries with distinct points coupled together via an action on 1-forms constructed as split Jordan bimodules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how the classical notions of time and causal structure may emerge together with quantum-mechanical probabilities from a universal quantum state. For this, the process of decoherence between semiclassical branches is important. Our discussion is based on quantum geometrodynamics, a canonical approach to quantum gravity. In this framework, a particular boundary condition may illuminate the issue of the arrow of (classical) time in connection to the growth of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Chirality, magic, and quantum correlations in multipartite quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of chirality for generic quantum states. A chiral state is defined as a state which cannot be transformed into its complex conjugate in a local product basis using local unitary operations. We introduce a number of quantitative measures of chirality which vanish for non-chiral states. A faithful measure called the "chiral log-distance" is defined in terms of the maximum fidelity between the state and its complex conjugate under local unitary transformations. We further introduce a set of computable measures that involve nested commutators of modular Hamiltonians. We show general relations between chirality and the amount of "magic" or non-stabilizer resource in a state. We first show that stabilizer states of qubits are non-chiral. Furthermore, magic monotones such as the stabilizer nullity and the stabilizer fidelity are lower-bounded by the chiral log-distance. We further relate chirality to discord-like quantum correlations. We define a measure of discord-like correlations called the intrinsic interferometric power, and show that it is lower-bounded by a nested commutator chirality measure. One interesting aspect of chirality is that it is not monotonic under local partial traces, indicating that it is a unique kind of resource that is not captured by traditional quantum resource theories.</description>

      <title>DESI results: Hint towards coupled dark matter and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario where a dark energy quintessence field $\phi$ with positive kinetic energy is coupled with dark matter. With two different self-interaction potentials for the field and a particular choice of the coupling function, we show explicitly how the observable effective equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ for the dark energy field crosses the phantom barrier ($w_{\rm eff} = -1$) while keeping the equation of state of the quintessence field $w_\phi &gt; -1$. With appropriate choices of parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$ crosses the phantom divide around redshift $z\sim 0.5$, transitioning from $w_{\rm eff} &lt;-1$ in the past to $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ today. This explains DESI observations well. Our analysis reveals that the model remains consistent within the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals provided by DESI for several combinations of the scalar field parameters, highlighting its potential in explaining the dynamics of dark energy arising from a simple Yukawa-type long-range interaction in the dark sector. While the current findings offer a promising framework for interpreting DESI observations, future work, including a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, is necessary to constrain the parameter space further and strengthen the statistical significance of the results.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee gravity: spherically-symmetric solutions away from the potential minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a vector model of spontaneous spacetime-symmetry breaking coupled to gravity: the bumblebee model. The primary focus is on static spherically symmetric solutions. Complementing previous work on black hole solutions, we study the effects on the solutions when the vector field does not lie at the minimum of its potential. We first investigate the flat spacetime limit, which can be viewed as a modified electrostatics model with a nonlinear interaction term. We study the stability of classical solutions generally and in the spherically-symmetric case. We also find that certain potentials, based on hypergeometric functions, yield a Hamiltonian bounded from below. With gravity, we solve for the spherically-symmetric metric and vector field, for a variety of choices of the potential energy functions, including ones beyond the quadratic potential like the hypergeometric potentials. Special case exact solutions are obtained showing Schwarszchild-Anti de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes. We employ horizon and asymptotic analytical expansions along with numerical solutions to explore the general case with the vector field away from the potential minimum. We discover interesting features of these solutions including naked singularities, repulsive gravity, and rapidly varying gravitational field near the source. Finally, we discuss observational constraints on these spacetimes using the resulting orbital behavior.</description>

      <title>Connecting Relativistic MOND Theories with Mimetic Gravity</title>

Abstract: We find a connection between relativistic Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theories and (scalar) mimetic gravity. We first demonstrate that any relativistic MOND model featuring a unit-timelike vector field, such as TeVeS or Aether-scalar-tensor theory, can be embedded within a conformal/disformal-invariant framework. Gauge fixing the conformal/disformal symmetry amounts to imposing a constraint on the norm of the vector, the scalar field or the cross contraction. Notably, we find that these constraints can be interchanged as long as the vector and scalar fields remain timelike. This means that relativistic MOND theories may be recasted as a mimetic gravity theory. Lastly, by constructing the fundamental building blocks of a conformal-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theory, we establish a new framework for developing relativistic MOND theories. This perspective offers deeper insight into how non-invertible disformal transformations and conformal/disformal symmetries serve as fundamental principles in constructing viable alternatives to dark matter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors in the perturbative limit</title>

Abstract: The generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) have been paid attention in recent years because of their relation with the energy momentum tensor (EMT) form factors (FFs). The GDAs can be experimentally accessed through the study of amplitudes in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, where $M_1M_2$ is a pseudoscalar meson pair such as $\pi \eta $ and $\eta \eta^{\prime}$. In this paper we calculate these amplitudes in the perturbative limit where the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are expressed in terms of meson distribution amplitudes which have been constrained in the past experiments. Our explicit calculation verifies the existence of a new EMT FF which breaks the conservation law of EMT for each quark flavor in its hadronic matrix element. In addition, our result shows that the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are identical between $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, which confirms the universality of GDAs. In future, the GDAs and EMT FFs studied in this paper can be investigated at Belle II. Our study enhances the accessibility to the $P$-wave GDAs in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$ and gives a promising way to search for exotic hybrid mesons in the future experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the Higgs particle self-coupling and its implications for electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model. We review the current experimental constraints on the Higgs trilinear coupling and discuss the challenges in measuring it precisely. The potential consequences of deviations from the Standard Model prediction are explored, including the possibility of new physics. We then consider an alternative ultraviolet complete electroweak theory based on finite quantum field theory, which does not require spontaneous symmetry breaking or a non-zero vacuum expectation value. The predictions of this model for particle masses and the stability of the electroweak vacuum are compared to the standard Higgs mechanism. Finally, we review the SM derivation of the W-boson mass, its dependence on radiative corrections and its experimentally determined value.</description>

      <title>What exactly does Bekenstein bound?</title>

Abstract: The Bekenstein bound posits a maximum entropy for matter with finite energy confined to a spatial region. It is often interpreted as a fundamental limit on the information that can be stored by physical objects. In this work, we test this interpretation by asking whether the Bekenstein bound imposes constraints on a channel's communication capacity, a context in which information can be given a mathematically rigorous and operationally meaningful definition. We study specifically the \emph{Unruh channel} that describes a stationary Alice exciting different species of free scalar fields to send information to an accelerating Bob, who is confined to a Rindler wedge and exposed to the noise of Unruh radiation. We show that the classical and quantum capacities of the Unruh channel obey the Bekenstein bound that pertains to the decoder Bob. In contrast, even at high temperatures, the Unruh channel can transmit a significant number of \emph{zero-bits}, which are quantum communication resources that can be used for quantum identification and many other primitive protocols. Therefore, unlike classical bits and qubits, zero-bits and their associated information processing capability are generally not constrained by the Bekenstein bound. However, we further show that when both the encoder and the decoder are restricted, the Bekenstein bound does constrain the channel capacities, including the zero-bit capacity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate positivity properties in quantum field theory (QFT). We provide evidence,and in some case proofs, that many building blocks of scattering amplitudes, and in some cases the full amplitudes, satisfy an infinite number of positivity conditions: the functions, as well as all their signed derivatives, are non-negative in a specified kinematic region. Such functions are known as completely monotonic(CM) in the mathematics literature. A powerful way to certify complete monotonicity is via integral representations. We thus show that it applies to planar and non-planar Feynman integrals possessing a Euclidean region,as well as to certain Euler integrals relevant to cosmological correlators and stringy integrals. This implies that in particular that many basic building blocks of perturbation theory, such as master integrals, can be chosen to be completely monotone. We also discuss two pathways for showing complete monotonicity for full amplitudes. One is related to properties of the analytic S-matrix. The other one is a close connection between the CM property and Positive Geometry. Motivated by this, we investigate positivity properties in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We present evidence, based on known analytic multi-loop results, that the CM property extends to several physical quantities in this theory. This includes the (suitably normalized) finite remainder function of the six-particle maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitude, four-point scattering amplitudes on the Coulomb branch,four-point correlation functions, as well as the angle-dependent cusp anomalous dimension. Our findings are however not limited to supersymmetric theories. It is shown that the CM property holds for the QCD and QED cusp anomalous dimensions, to three and four loops, respectively. We comment on open questions, and on possible numerical applications of complete monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy in Non-Supersymmetric Quasi-Realistic Heterotic-String Vacua with Fixed Moduli</title>

Abstract: Recently, Baykara, Tarazi and Vafa discussed the existence of quasicrystalline string vacua that contain a single neutral moduli, the dilaton, and studied compactifications of the non-supersymmetric $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ heterotic-string on these spaces. We discuss a specific class of quasi-realistic string vacua with similar properties that has been known since the late eighties and analyse the vacuum energy in several non-supersymmetric examples that correspond to compactifications of tachyon free ten dimensional vacua as well as compactifications of tachyonic ten dimensional vacua. Our analysis uses the Free Fermionic Formalism of the heterotic-string in four dimensions and employs asymmetric boundary conditions that project all the geometrical moduli by Generalised GSO projections. This methodology produces models with both positive and negative spacetime potential at one-loop.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds, Significantly Limit Using Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many minimally coupled light scalars that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints.</description>

      <title>Condensate decay in a radiation dominated cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the decay of a homogeneous condensate of a massive scalar field of mass \emph{m} into massless fields in thermal equilibrium in a radiation dominated cosmology. The model is a \emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium dynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After consistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the causal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite temperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical renormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation rate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from stimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is explicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not describe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime, relevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as $e^{-\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\,\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude decays as $e^{-\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite temperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion. A main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to describe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\gamma(t)$ is always \emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence of the cosmological expansion. For ultra light dark matter, the time scale during which transient dynamics is sensitive to cosmological expansion and a local friction term is inadequate, is much longer. A friction term always \emph{underestimates} the time scale of decay in the sub-Hubble case.</description>

Abstract: There exist metastable domain walls of the flavor-singlet meson $\eta$ for the ${\rm U}(1)$ axial symmetry in two-flavor color superconductivity (2SC) in QCD at large baryon density. We show that, due to the coupling of $\eta$ to confined ${\rm SU}(2)$ gluons in the 2SC phase, the effective theory on the domain wall is described by the ${\rm SU}(2)_{-1}$ Chern-Simons theory, which is dual to the ${\rm U}(1)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory. This theory has a spin-1 droplet excitation that does not carry a baryon number, which we identify as a vector meson. We also discuss the effective theories and baryonic droplet excitations on the domain walls of the flavor-singlet mesons in the superfluid phases of QCD at large isospin density and two-color QCD at large baryon density.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from solutions of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct solutions of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Apart from these we show that solutions constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions and Clifford algebras also satisfy these constraints. Furthermore it is observed that the Clifford solutions give rise to positive Boltzmann weights resulting in the possibility of physical statistical mechanics models in higher dimensions. Finally we also show that anti-Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter-like equations with a negative sign on the right hand side] can also be lifted to higher simplex solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the feasibility of realizing the Dark Dimension Scenario through T-fold compactifications on $T^5 \times S^1$, where the base of the internal space $S^1$ naturally acts as the requisite mesoscopic extra dimension. Utilizing Scherk--Schwarz reduction from 5D to 4D, and applying duality twists from both elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes of subgroups of the T-duality group associated with $T^5$, we stabilize the volume of $T^5$ and several other moduli. This approach generates a potential characterized by two runaway directions, one aligned with the Scherk--Schwarz radion. Further stabilization efforts yield a decreasing potential trajectory demanded by the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

Abstract: The mass and the spin of accreting and jetted black holes, at the center of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), can be probed by analyzing their electromagnetic spectra. For this purpose, we use the Spin-Modified Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, which non-linearly connects the following four variables (in the source frame): radio luminosity, X-ray or optical luminosity (via the [OIII] emission line), black hole mass and spin. Taking into account the uncertainties in luminosity measurements, conversion factors, relativistic beaming and physical properties of the AGN system, we derive lower bounds on the spins of a group of heavy, jetted AGNs. Using these results, we study the direct implications on the mass spectrum of the ultra-light particles of scalar (axion-like), vector (dark photon) and tensor types (additional spin-2 particles). We close unexplored gap in the parameter space $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$eV. We obtain upper bounds on the axion decay constant (equivalently lower bounds on the self-interaction strength) considering self-interactions could prevent the axion particles entering the instability, and be the reason for non-observation of superradiance. Assuming axion/scalar is described by mass and decay constant, we obtain upper limits on what fraction of dark matter can be formed by ultra-light particles and find that single spieces axion-like light particle can constitute at most $10\%$ of the dark matter in the mass range: $ 10^{-21} &lt; \mu \, (\mathrm{eV}) &lt; 10^{-17}$. Moreover, we derive similar bounds for vector and spin-2 particles and find that light vector fields can constitute at most $10^{-6}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-21}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range, and light spin-2 fields can constitute at most $10^{-9}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-23}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range.</description>

Abstract: Using a Dyson--Schwinger approach, we perform an analysis of the non-trivial ground state of thermal $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory in the non-perturbative regime where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Basic thermodynamic observables such as energy density and pressure are derived analytically, using Jacobi Elliptic functions. The results are compared with lattice results. Good agreement is found at low temperatures, providing a viable scenario of a gas of massive glue states populating higher levels of the spectrum of the theory. At high temperatures a scenario without glue states consistent with a massive scalar field is observed, showing an interesting agreement with lattice data. The possibility is discussed that the results derived in this analysis open up a novel pathway beyond lattice to precision studies of phase transitions with false vacuum and cosmological relics that depend on QCD-like equations of state in strongly coupled gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</title>

Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</description>

      <title>Deep thermalization under charge-conserving quantum dynamics</title>

Abstract: "Deep thermalization" describes the emergence of universal wavefunction distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wavefunction distributions. We put forth a universal ansatz for the limiting form of the projected ensemble, motivated by maximum-entropy principles rooted in statistical physics and quantum information theory. This limiting form depends on a polynomial amount of data on the initial state and measurement basis, a `coarse-graining' that is an essential feature of bona fide thermodynamic ensembles. We support our ansatz with three complementary approaches: (i) a rigorous proof in the simplest case of no charge fluctuations in either the initial state or the measurement basis; (ii) analytical calculations using a `replica limit' approach, applicable when charge fluctuations are allowed in either the input state or the measurement basis but not both; (iii) extensive numerical simulations of finite-sized systems in the most general case. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.</description>

      <title>Squeezed vacua and primordial features in effective theories of inflation at N2LO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite duration of cosmic inflation can result in features $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}(k) = |\alpha_k-\beta_k\,\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\delta_k}|^2 \,\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}^{(0)}(k)$ in the primordial power spectrum that carry information about a quantum gravity phase before inflation. While the almost scale-invariant power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}^{(0)}$ for the quasi-Bunch-Davies vacuum is fully determined by the inflationary background dynamics, the Bogoliubov coefficients $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ for the squeezed vacuum depend on new physics beyond inflation and have been used to produce phenomenological templates for the features. The phase $\delta_k$ vanishes in de Sitter space and therefore is often neglected, but it results in non-trivial effects in quasi-de Sitter inflationary geometries. Here we consider a large class of effective theories of inflation and provide a closed-form expression for $\delta_k$ and for the fully expanded power spectrum up to next-to-next-leading order (N2LO) in the Hubble-flow expansion. In particular, for the Starobinsky model of inflation we find that this relative phase can be expressed in terms of the scalar tilt $n_\mathrm{s}$ as $\delta_{k\ast}=\frac{\pi}{2}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)-\frac{\pi}{4}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)^2\,\ln(k/k_*)$. The relative phase results in a negative shift and a running frequency that have been considered in the most studied phenomenological templates for primordial features, thus providing precise theoretical predictions for upcoming cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Strong Field Scattering of Black Holes: Assessing Resummation Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in post-Minkowksian (PM) calculations have led to a fast-growing body of weak-field perturbative information. As such, there is major interest within the gravitational wave community as to how this information can be used to improve the accuracy of theoretical waveform models. In this work, we build on recent efforts to validate high-order PM calculations using numerical relativity simulations. We present a new set of high-energy scattering simulations for equal-mass, non-spinning binary black holes, further expanding the existing suite of NR simulations. We outline the basic features of three recently proposed resummation schemes (the $\mathscr{L}$-resummed model, the $w^\mathrm{eob}$ model and the SEOB-PM model) and compare the analytical predictions to our NR data. Each model is shown to demonstrate pathological behaviour at high energies, with common features such as PM hierarchical shifts and divergences. The NR data can also be used to calibrate pseudo-5PM corrections to the scattering angle or EOB radial potentials. In each case, we argue that including higher-order information improves the agreement between the analytical models and NR, though the extent of improvement depends on how this information is incorporated and the choice of analytical baseline. Finally, we demonstrate that further resummation of the EOB radial potentials could be an effective strategy to improving the model agreement.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar and tensor perturbations with a scalar field: quadratic-order effective energy-momentum tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar and tensor modes of the gravitational perturbation in the presence of a scalar field which describes inflation. We investigate the back-reaction of the perturbations to the background by studying the effective energy-momentum tensor (2EMT) which is the second order constructed by the quadratic terms of the linear perturbations. 2EMT is gauge dependent due to the scalar mode. We obtain 2EMT in the slow-roll stage of inflation, and get its cosmological expressions in three (longitudinal, spatially flat, and comoving) gauge conditions. We find that the pure scalar-mode part in 2EMT is stronger in the short-wavelength limit, while the parts involved with the tensor mode (the pure tensor-mode part and the scalar-tensor coupled part) are stronger in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Kita--Yoshida and Cho--Matsumoto introduced intersection forms on the twisted (co)homologies of hyperplane arrangement complements. We give a closed combinatorial formula for these intersection pairings. We show that these intersection pairings are obtained from (continuous and discrete) Laplace transforms of subfans of the Bergman fan of the associated matroid. We compute inverses of these intersection pairings, allowing us to identify (variants of) these intersection forms with the contravariant form of Schechtman--Varchenko, and the bilinear form of Varchenko.
  Building on parallel joint work with C. Eur, we define a notion of scattering amplitudes for matroids. We show that matroid amplitudes satisfy locality and unitarity, and recover biadjoint scalar amplitudes in the case of the complete graphic matroid. We apply our formulae for twisted intersection forms to deduce old and new formulae for scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The timeline of the expansion rate ultimately defines the interplay between high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The guiding theme of this topical review is provided by the scrutiny of the early history of the space-time curvature through the diffuse backgrounds of gravitational radiation that are sensitive to all the stages of the evolution of the plasma. Due to their broad spectrum (extending from the aHz region to the THz domain) they bridge the macroworld described by general relativity and the microworld of the fundamental constituents of matter. It is argued that during the next score year the analysis of the relic gravitons may infirm or confirm the current paradigm where a radiation plasma is assumed to dominate the whole post-inflationary epoch. The role of high frequency and ultra-high frequency signals between the MHz and the THz is emphasized in the perspective of quantum sensing. The multiparticle final state of the relic gravitons and its macroscopic quantumness is also discussed with particular attention to the interplay between the entanglement entropy and the maximal frequency of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Line operators in the G2HDM model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of the Gauged Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (G2HDM), a framework that extends the Standard Model by introducing a dark sector governed by the gauge symmetry $U(1)_X \times SU(2)_H$. The full gauge symmetry of the theory, including the visible sector, is given by the universal covering group $\tilde{G} = U(1)_Y \times SU(2)_L \times SU(3)_C \times U(1)_X \times SU(2)_H$. However, the true gauge group may instead be a quotient $G = \tilde{G} / \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the center of $\tilde{G}$ or a subgroup thereof, leading to different global structures that cannot be distinguished by local experiments.We explore the physical implications of these global structures, analyzing their effects on Wilson, 't Hooft, and dyonic line operators, as well as the periodicity of the CP-violating $\theta$-angles associated with each group factor. Furthermore, we determine the minimal electric and magnetic charges that arise after electroweak symmetry breaking, highlighting their dependence on the choice of $\Gamma$. These findings provide a systematic characterization of the G2HDM's global properties and their potential phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <title>Influence of Quantum Correction on Kerr Black Hole in Effective Loop Quantum Gravity via Shadows and EHT Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a study on shadow of quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole in loop quantum gravity appeared in [Ye et al., Phys. Lett. B 851, 138566, (2024)] assuming a fixed value of Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$. Following this approach, we considered its rotating counterpart being a quantum corrected Kerr black hole in effective loop quantum gravity and studied its deviation from Kerr black hole for a fixed value of $\gamma$. We proposed and proved a theorem describing the location of unstable circular null orbits for all such Kerr-like metrics. The deviation between the shadows of the Kerr and quantum corrected Kerr black holes has also been studied, and parameters are constrained by comparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the quantity of deviation due to quantum correction. Lastly, we immersed the quantum corrected Kerr black hole in an inhomogeneous plasma and studied its impact on the shadow size. We found that the unstable null orbits for the quantum corrected Kerr black hole are always smaller than the unstable null orbits for Kerr black hole. The effect of Barbero-Immirzi parameter allows the quantum corrected Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability than the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum corrected Kerr black hole does not mimic M87*. The plasma reduces the size of the shadow of quantum corrected black hole, and the plasma parameter in the case II is more sensitive than that in case I.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary structure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent progress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are interpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework, we prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry has seen little study. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is easily adaptable for study of symmetry in other probes of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>On regular charged black holes in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As argued in arXiv:2104.10172, introducing a non-minimally coupled scalar field, three-dimensional Einstein gravity can be extended by infinite families of theories which admit simple analytic generalizations of the charged BTZ black hole. Depending on the gravitational couplings, the solutions may describe black holes with one or several horizons and with curvature or BTZ-like singularities. In other cases, the metric function behaves as $f(r)\overset{(r\rightarrow 0)}{\sim} \mathcal{O}(r^{2s})$ with $s\geq 1$, and the black holes are completely regular -- a feature unique to three dimensions. Regularity arises generically i.e., without requiring any fine-tuning of parameters. In this paper we show that all these theories satisfy Birkhoff theorems, so that the most general spherically-symmetric solutions are given by the corresponding static black holes. We perform a thorough characterization of the Penrose diagrams of the solutions, finding a rich structure which includes, in particular, cases which tessellate the plane and others in which the diagrams cannot be drawn in a single plane. We also study the motion of probe particles on the black holes, finding that observers falling to regular black holes reach the center after a finite proper time. Contrary to the singular cases, the particles are not torn apart by tidal forces, so they oscillate between antipodal points describing many-universe orbits. We argue that in those cases the region $r=0$ can be interpreted as a horizon with vanishing surface gravity, giving rise to generic inner-extremal regular black hole solutions. We also analyze the deep interior region of the solutions identifying the presence of Kasner eons and the conditions under which they take place. Finally, we construct new black hole solutions in the case in which infinite towers of terms are included in the action.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Weak Gravity Conjecture via Leading-Order Quantum Gravity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak gravity conjecture posits that there should exist at least one state with a charge-to-mass ratio $q/M&gt;1$, ensuring that an extremal charged black hole can still decay. In this paper, we study the corrections to the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes within an effective field theory framework. The effective action originates from integrating out massless particles, including gravitons, at one-loop level. We demonstrate that these quantum gravity effects naturally give rise to the super-extremality of charged black holes, which aligns with a recent result by Arkani-Hamed et al. Furthermore, our formalism provides a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of both extremal and non-extremal RN black holes, offering additional interesting implications.</description>
