      <title>Validating a lutetium frequency reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review our progress in developing a frequency reference with singly ionized lutetium and give estimates of the levels of inaccuracy we expect to achieve in the near future with both the $^1S_0\leftrightarrow{}^3D_1$ and $^1S_0\leftrightarrow{}^3D_2$ transitions. Based on established experimental results, we show that inaccuracies at the low $10^{-19}$ level are readily achievable for the $^1S_0\leftrightarrow{}^3D_1$ transition, and the frequency ratio between the two transitions is limited almost entirely by the BBR shift. We argue that the frequency ratio measured within the one apparatus provides a well-defined metric to compare and establish the performance of remotely located systems. For the measurement of an in situ frequency ratio, relativistic shifts drop out and both transitions experience the same electromagnetic environment. Consequently, the uncertainty budget for the ratio is practically identical to the uncertainty budgets for the individual transitions. If the ratios for two or more systems disagree we can be certain at least one of the clock assessments is incorrect. If they agree, subsequent comparisons on one transition would only differ by relativistic effects. Since motional effects are easily assessed and typically small for a heavy ion, only the differential gravitational red-shift will significantly contribute and this can be confirmed by comparison on the second transition.</description>

      <title>Simple tunable phase-locked lasers for quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a wide range of quantum technology applications, ranging from atomic clocks to the creation of ultracold or quantum degenerate samples for atom interferometry, optimal laser sources are critical. In particular, two phase-locked laser sources with a precise difference frequency are needed for efficient coherent population trapping (CPT) clocks, gray molasses laser cooling, or driving Raman transitions. Here we show how a simple cost-effective laser diode can selectively amplify only one sideband of a fiber-electrooptically-modulated seed laser to produce moderate-power phase-locked light with sub-Hz relative linewidth and tunable difference frequencies up to $\approx 15\,$GHz. The architecture is readily scalable to multiple phase-locked lasers and could conceivably be used for future on-chip compact phase-locked laser systems for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Fast photon-mediated entanglement of continuously-cooled trapped ions for quantum networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We entangle two co-trapped atomic barium ion qubits by collecting single visible photons from each ion through in-vacuo 0.8 NA objectives, interfering them through an integrated fiber-beamsplitter and detecting them in coincidence. This projects the qubits into an entangled Bell state with an observed fidelity lower bound of F &gt; 94%. We also introduce an ytterbium ion for sympathetic cooling to remove the need for recooling interruptions and achieve a continuous entanglement rate of 250 1/s.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Frequency Shift Caused by Nonuniform Field and Boundary Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic field inhomogeneity is usually detrimental to magnetic resonance (MR) experiments. It is widely recognized that a nonuniform magnetic field can lead to an increase in the resonance line width, as well as a reduction in sensitivity and spectral resolution. However, nonuniform magnetic field can also cause shift in resonance frequency, which received far less attention. In this work, we investigate the frequency shift under arbitrary nonuniform magnetic field and boundary relaxation by applying perturbation theory to the Torrey equation. Several compact frequency shift formulas are reported. We find that the frequency shift is mainly determined by $B_z$ distribution (rather than the transverse field components in previous study) and has important dependence on boundary relaxation. Furthermore, due to the difference of boundary relaxation and high order perturbation correction, this frequency shift is spin-species dependent, which implies a systematic error in many MR based precision measurements such as NMR gyroscope and comagnetometers. This insight provides a potential tool for understanding the unexplained isotope shifts in recent NMR gyroscope and new physics searching experiments that utilize comagnetometers. Finally, we propose a new tool for wall interaction research based on the frequency shift's dependency on boundary relaxation.</description>

      <title>Threshold and frequency properties of a cold ytterbium laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the lasing action observed on the 1S0--3P1 intercombination transition of ytterbium atoms that are laser-cooled and -trapped inside a high-finesse cavity. The dressing of the atomic states on the 1S0--1P1 transition by the magneto-optical trap (MOT) laser light allows the coupled atom-cavity system to lase, via a two-photon transition, on the same line on which it is pumped. The observation and basic description of this phenomenon was presented earlier by Gothe et al. [Phys. Rev. A 99, 013415 (2019)]. In the current work, we focus on a detailed analysis of the lasing threshold and frequency properties and perform a comparison to our theoretical models.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity detection of large-scale atom arrays in an optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulation based on neutral atoms have largely benefited from high-resolution, single-atom sensitive imaging techniques. A variety of approaches have been developed to achieve such local detection of atoms in optical lattices or optical tweezers. For alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms, the presence of narrow optical transitions opens up the possibility of performing novel types of Sisyphus cooling, where the cooling mechanism originates from the capability to spatially resolve the differential optical level shifts in the trap potential. Up to now, it has been an open question whether high-fidelity imaging could be achieved in a "repulsive Sisyphus" configuration, where the trap depth of the ground state exceeds that of the excited state involved in cooling. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity ($99.971(1)\%$) and high-survival ($99.80(5)\%$) imaging of strontium atoms using repulsive Sisyphus cooling. We use an optical lattice as a pinning potential for atoms in a large-scale tweezer array with up to $399$ tweezers and show repeated, high-fidelity lattice-tweezer-lattice transfers. We furthermore demonstrate loading the lattice with approximately 10000 atoms directly from the MOT and scalable imaging over $&gt;10000$ lattice sites with a combined survival probability and classification fidelity better than $99.2\%$. Our lattice thus serves as a locally addressable and sortable reservoir for continuous refilling of optical tweezer arrays in the future.</description>

      <title>Matter-wave collimation to picokelvin energies with scattering length and potential shape control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of atom interferometers depends on their ability to realize long pulse separation times and prevent loss of contrast by limiting the expansion of the atomic ensemble within the interferometer beam through matter-wave collimation. Here we investigate the impact of atomic interactions on collimation by applying a lensing protocol to a $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensate at different scattering lengths. Tailoring interactions, we measure energies corresponding to $340 \pm 12$ pK in one direction. Our results are supported by an accurate simulation, which allows us to extrapolate a 2D ballistic expansion energy of $438 \pm 77$ pK. Based on our findings we propose an advanced scenario, which enables 3D expansion energies below $16$ pK by implementing an additional pulsed delta-kick. Our results pave the way to realize ensembles with more than $1\times10^5$ atoms and 3D energies in the two-digit pK range in typical dipole trap setups without the need for micro-gravity or long baseline environments.</description>

      <title>Measuring Unruh radiation from accelerated electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06772v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting thermal Unruh radiation from accelerated electrons has presented a formidable challenge due not only to technical difficulties but also for lack of conceptual clarity about what is actually seen by a laboratory observer. We give a summary of the current interpretations along with a simpler heuristic description that draws on the analogy between the Unruh effect and radiation from a two-level atomic system. We propose an experiment to test whether there is emission of thermal photons from an accelerated electron.</description>
