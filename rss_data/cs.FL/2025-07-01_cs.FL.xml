      <title>Programmable Co-Transcriptional Splicing: Realizing Regular Languages via Hairpin Deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA co-transcriptionality, where RNA is spliced or folded during transcription from DNA templates, offers promising potential for molecular programming. It enables programmable folding of nano-scale RNA structures and has recently been shown to be Turing universal. While post-transcriptional splicing is well studied, co-transcriptional splicing is gaining attention for its efficiency, though its unpredictability still remains a challenge. In this paper, we focus on engineering co-transcriptional splicing, not only as a natural phenomenon but as a programmable mechanism for generating specific RNA target sequences from DNA templates. The problem we address is whether we can encode a set of RNA sequences for a given system onto a DNA template word, ensuring that all the sequences are generated through co-transcriptional splicing. Given that finding the optimal encoding has been shown to be NP-complete under the various energy models considered, we propose a practical alternative approach under the logarithmic energy model. More specifically, we provide a construction that encodes an arbitrary nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) into a circular DNA template from which co-transcriptional splicing produces all sequences accepted by the NFA. As all finite languages can be efficiently encoded as NFA, this framework solves the problem of finding small DNA templates for arbitrary target sets of RNA sequences. The quest to obtain the smallest possible such templates naturally leads us to consider the problem of minimizing NFA and certain practically motivated variants of it, but as we show, those minimization problems are computationally intractable.</description>

      <title>Reachability in symmetric VASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reachability problem in symmetric vector addition systems with states (VASS), where transitions are invariant under a group of permutations of coordinates. One extremal case, the trivial groups, yields general VASS. In another extremal case, the symmetric groups, we show that the reachability problem can be solved in PSPACE, regardless of the dimension of input VASS (to be contrasted with Ackermannian complexity in general VASS). We also consider other groups, in particular alternating and cyclic ones. Furthermore, motivated by the open status of the reachability problem in data VASS, we estimate the gain in complexity when the group arises as a combination of the trivial and symmetric groups.</description>

      <title>On the Reachability Problem for Two-Dimensional Branching VASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vectors addition systems with states (VASS), or equivalently Petri nets, are arguably one of the most studied formalisms for the modeling and analysis of concurrent systems. A central decision problem for VASS is reachability: whether there exists a run from an initial configuration to a final one. This problem has been known to be decidable for over forty years, and its complexity has recently been precisely characterized. Our work concerns the reachability problem for BVASS, a branching generalization of VASS. In dimension one, the exact complexity of this problem is known. In this paper, we prove that the reachability problem for 2-dimensional BVASS is decidable. In fact, we even show that the reachability set admits a computable semilinear presentation. The decidability status of the reachability problem for BVASS remains open in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bridging Chaos Game Representations and $k$-mer Frequencies of DNA Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes formal mathematical foundations linking Chaos Game Representations (CGR) of DNA sequences to their underlying $k$-mer frequencies. We prove that the Frequency CGR (FCGR) of order $k$ is mathematically equivalent to a discretization of CGR at resolution $2^k \times 2^k$, and its vectorization corresponds to the $k$-mer frequencies of the sequence. Additionally, we characterize how symmetry transformations of CGR images correspond to specific nucleotide permutations in the originating sequences. Leveraging these insights, we introduce an algorithm that generates synthetic DNA sequences from prescribed $k$-mer distributions by constructing Eulerian paths on De Bruijn multigraphs. This enables reconstruction of sequences matching target $k$-mer profiles with arbitrarily high precision, facilitating the creation of synthetic CGR images for applications such as data augmentation for machine learning-based taxonomic classification of DNA sequences. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our method across both real genomic data and artificially sampled distributions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive framework that unifies CGR geometry, $k$-mer statistics, and sequence reconstruction, offering new tools for genomic analysis and visualization.</description>
