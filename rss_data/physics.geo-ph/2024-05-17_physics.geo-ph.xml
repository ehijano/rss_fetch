      <title>Synthetic RAW data generator for ESA HARMONY mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce HEEPS/MARE, the end-to-end simulator developed for the SAR oceanographic products of ESA Earth Explorer 10 mission, Harmony, expected to launch in Decembre 2029. Harmony is primarily dedicated to the observation of small-scale motion and deformation fields of the Earth surface (oceans, glaciers and ice sheets, solid Earth), thanks to passive SAR/ATI receivers carried by two companion satellites for Sentinel-1. The paper focuses on the raw data generator designed to efficiently simulate large, heterogeneous, moving oceanic areas and produce the acquired SAR/ATI bistatic IQ signals. The heterogeneous sea-surface model, bistatic scattering model, multi-GPU implementation and achieved performance are emphasized. Finally, sample results are presented, to illustrate the ability of Harmony to map wind and surface current vectors at kilometric scale.</description>

      <title>Fe-FeH Eutectic Melting Curve and the Estimates of Earth's Core Temperature and Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fe and FeH form a binary eutectic system above ~40 GPa. Here we performed melting experiments in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (DAC) and obtained the Fe-FeH eutectic melting curve between 52 and 175 GPa. Its extrapolation shows the eutectic temperature to be 4700 K at the inner core boundary (ICB), which is lower than that in Fe-FeSi but is higher than those in the Fe-S, Fe-O, and Fe-C systems. In addition, its dT/dP slope is comparable to those of the melting curves of Fe and FeH endmembers, suggesting that the eutectic liquid composition changes little with increasing pressure and is about FeH0.6 at the ICB pressure. We also estimated the effect of each light element on depressing the liquidus temperature at 330 GPa based on a combination of binary eutectic temperature and composition and found that the effect is large for C and S, moderate for H and O, and small for Si when considering the amount of each element that reduces a certain percentage of a liquid iron density. Furthermore, we searched for a set of possible outer core liquid composition and ICB temperature (the liquidus temperature of the former at 330 GPa should match the latter), which explains the outer core density deficit that depends on core temperature. The results demonstrate that relatively low core temperatures, lower than the solidus temperature of a pyrolitic lowermost mantle at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), are possible when the core is poor in Si.</description>

      <title>Indications and implications of a borehole seismic monitoring result of the San Andreas Fault foresee future earthquake prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parkfield M6 earthquake predicted from 1985 by the USGS to happen by 1993 happened 11 years later in 2004 instead. Till today, satisfactory answers to why this earthquake was mis-predicted have not been found. Seven months after the earthquake, we deployed a seismic array in the SAFOD main hole to monitor the San Andreas Fault. During a 13 days period, we recorded 220 earthquake events. By analyzing the projected hypocenters of 100 earthquake events, we found three main active sub-faults, namely SAF1, SAF2, and SAF3, with SAF1 being the normally regarded SAF. During the monitoring period, there was an earthquake migration trend that shows the move of SAF1 drags SAF2, which in turn drags SAF3, to slip and dip downwards. This could be reflected by the result of a geological trenching across the SAF. On SAF1, the smaller earthquakes tended to occur earlier in southeast and the larger earthquakes tended to occur later in northwest, which could indicate the existence of strong asperities. However, the new earthquakes on SAF2 were overall remarkably smaller, which could indicate that during the 2004 M6 earthquake the main underground rupture took place on SAF2, which could extend with a bend near Parkfield town to the Southwest Fracture Zone, and further to include the seemingly isolated 2004 M6 hypocenter. The possible prevailing of this triple active sub-faults model in the Parkfield area may account for 12, 24 or 36 (instead of a single 22 years as previously believed) recurring years of M6 earthquakes, depending on how many of these active sub-faults have basically absorbed the tectonic stress. In less than 0.1% of the earthquake's last intermission time, and at just one location, our borehole seismic monitoring has revealed so much insightful information that earthquake prediction may be feasible if the fault is monitored in boreholes at more locations and for longer periods of time.</description>
