      <title>A non-rational Verlinde formula from Virasoro TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Virasoro TQFT to derive an integral identity that we view as a non-rational generalization of the Verlinde formula for the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c\geq 25$. The identity expresses the Virasoro fusion kernel as an integral over a ratio of modular S-kernels on the (punctured) torus. In particular, it shows that the one-point S-kernel diagonalizes the Virasoro $6j$ symbol. After carefully studying the analytic properties of this `Virasoro-Verlinde formula', we present three applications. In boundary Liouville CFT, the formula ensures the open-closed duality of the boundary one-point function on the annulus. In pure 3d gravity, it provides an essential step in computing the partition function on hyperbolic 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. Lastly, in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, the formula computes a three-boundary torus wormhole, which leads to a prediction for the statistical correlation between the density of states and two OPE coefficients in the dual large-$c$ CFT ensemble. We conclude by discussing the implications of our result for the fusion rules in generic non-rational 2d CFTs.</description>

      <title>Emergent Geometry from Quantum Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrying the insights of conditional probability to the quantum realm is notoriously difficult due to the non-commutative nature of quantum observables. Nevertheless, conditional expectations on von Neumann algebras have played a significant role in the development of quantum information theory, and especially the study of quantum error correction. In quantum gravity, it has been suggested that conditional expectations may be used to implement the holographic map algebraically, with quantum error correction underlying the emergence of spacetime through the generalized entropy formula. However, the requirements for exact error correction are almost certainly too strong for realistic theories of quantum gravity. In this note, we present a relaxed notion of quantum conditional expectation which implements approximate error correction. We introduce a generalization of Connes' spatial theory adapted to completely positive maps, and derive a chain rule allowing for the non-commutative factorization of relative modular operators into a marginal and conditional part, constituting a quantum Bayes' law. This allows for an exact quantification of the information gap occurring in the data processing inequality for arbitrary quantum channels. When applied to algebraic inclusions, this also provides an approach to factorizing the entropy of states into a sum of terms which, in the gravitational context, may be interpreted as a generalized entropy. We illustrate that the emergent area operator is fully non-commutative rather than central, except under the conditions of exact error correction. We provide some comments on how this result may be used to construct a fully algebraic quantum extremal surface prescription and to probe the quantum nature of black holes.</description>

      <title>Smooth extremal horizons are the exception, not the rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the general charged, rotating black hole in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory has a singular extremal limit. Only the known analytic solutions with exactly zero charge or zero angular momenta have smooth extremal horizons. When the two angular momenta are not equal and both are scaled to zero, the solution approaches a new family of static, nonspherical extremal black holes. We also consider general black holes in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, and show that they also have singular extremal limits except for one special value of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term (the one fixed by supergravity). Combining this with earlier results showing that extremal black holes have singular horizons in four-dimensional general relativity with small higher derivative corrections, and in anti-de Sitter space with perturbed boundary conditions, one sees that smooth extremal horizons are indeed the exception and not the rule.</description>

      <title>Non-isometry, State-Dependence and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an equivalence between non-isometry of quantum codes and state-dependence of operator reconstruction, and discuss implications of this equivalence for holographic duality. Specifically, we define quantitative measures of non-isometry and state-dependence and describe bounds relating these quantities. In the context of holography we show that, assuming known gravitational path integral results for overlaps between semiclassical states, non-isometric bulk-to-boundary maps with a trivial kernel are approximately isometric and bulk reconstruction approximately state-independent. In contrast, non-isometric maps with a non-empty kernel always lead to state-dependent reconstruction. We also show that if a global bulk-to-boundary map is non-isometric, then there exists a region in the bulk which is causally disconnected from the boundary. Finally, we conjecture that, under certain physical assumptions for the definition of the Hilbert space of effective field theory in AdS space, the presence of a global horizon implies a non-isometric global bulk-to-boundary map.</description>

      <title>Gluing via Intersection Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-point functions in N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory can be constructed using integrability by triangulating the surfaces on which Feynman graphs would be drawn. It remains hard to analytically compute the necessary re-gluing of the tiles by virtual particles. We propose a new approach to study a series of residues encountered in the two-particle gluing of the planar one-loop five-point function of stress tensor multiplets. After exposing the twisted period nature of the integral functions, we employ intersection theory to derive canonical differential equations and present a solution.</description>

      <title>Exact large $N$ expansion of mass deformed ABJM theory on squashed sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the partition function of the mass deformed ABJM theory on a squashed three sphere. In particular, we focus on the case with the Chern-Simons levels being $\pm 1$ and apply a duality between this theory and the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $\mathrm{U}\left(N\right)$ super Yang-Mills theory with an adjoint hypermultiplet and a fundamental hypermultiplet. For a special mass parameter depending on the squashing parameter, we find that the partition function can be written as that of an ideal Fermi gas with a non-trivial density matrix. By studying this density matrix, we analytically derive the all order perturbative expansion of the partition function in $1/N$, which turns out to take the form of the Airy function. Our results not only align with previous findings and conjectures but also lead to a new formula for the overall constant factor of the partition function. We also study the exact values of the partition function for small but finite values of $N$.</description>

      <title>A rich structure of renormalization group flows for Higgs-like models in 4 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $2$ coupled Higgs doublets which transform in the usual way under SU(2)$\otimes$U(1). By constructing certain marginal operators that break time reversal symmetry, we can obtain a rich pattern of renormalization group (RG) flows which includes lines of fixed points and more interestingly, cyclic RG flows which are rather generic. The hamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}$ with ${\cal K}^2 =1$, however it still enjoys real eigenvalues and a unitary time evolution. Upon spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs fields have an infinite number of vacuum expectation values $v_n$ which satisfy ``Russian Doll" scaling $v_n \sim e^{2 n \lambda}$ where $n=1,2,3,\ldots$ and $\lambda$ is the period of one RG cycle which is an RG invariant. We speculate that this Russian Doll RG flow can perhaps explain the origin of ``families" in the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of the recently discovered family of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariant potentials describing inflationary $\alpha$-attractors. These potentials have an inflationary plateau consisting of the fundamental domain and its images fully covering the upper part of the Poincar\'e half-plane. Meanwhile, the lower part of the half-plane is covered by an infinitely large number of ridges, which, at first glance, are too sharp to support inflation. However, we show that this apparent sharpness is just an illusion created by hyperbolic geometry, and each of these ridges is physically equivalent to the inflationary plateau in the upper part of the Poincar\'e half-plane.</description>

      <title>Diving into a multi-band holographic superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the interior structure of a multi-band holographic superconductor model. We focus on the holographic superconductor system with two scalar fields which correspond to two s-wave order parameters in the dual condensed matter system. With two s-wave order parameters, the boundary system has more interesting behaviors which can also be reflected in black hole interior structure. We find the Einstein-Rosen bridge collapse and Josephson oscillations of two scalar fields inside the horizon. For the region near the singularity, we find that the metric still presents Kasner form and there is also Kasner transition behavior. However, when two scalar fields coexist, the Kasner exponents and Kasner transition formula will be different from the single scalar field case. The different interior structures between multi-band holographic superconductor and single-band holographic superconductor we find in this work further confirms that the black hole interior is important to reflect the properties of dual condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>$2$-R\'enyi CCNR Negativity of Compact Boson for multiple disjoint intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate mixed-state bipartite entanglement between multiple disjoint intervals using the computable cross-norm criterion (CCNR). We consider entanglement between a single interval and the union of remaining disjoint intervals, and compute $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity for $2$d massless compact boson. The expression for $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity is given in terms of cross-ratios and Riemann period matrices of Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation. In general, the Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation of $n$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity do not possess a $Z_n$ symmetry. We also evaluate the Reflected R\'enyi entropy related to the $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity. This Reflected R\'enyi entropy is a universal quantity. We extend these calculations to the $2$d massless Dirac fermions as well. Finally, the analytical results are checked against the numerical evaluations in the tight-binding model and are found to be in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Holographic multipartite entanglement from the upper bound of $n$-partite information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To analyze the holographic multipartite entanglement structure, we study the upper bound for holographic $n$-partite information $(-1)^n I_n$ that $n-1$ fixed boundary subregions participate together with an arbitrary region $E$. In general cases, we could find regions $E$ that make $I_n$ approach the upper bound. For $n=3$, we show that the upper bound of $-I_3$ is given by a quantity that we name the entanglement of state-constrained purification $EoSP(A:B)$. For $n\geq4$, we find that the upper bound of $I_n$ is finite in holographic CFT$_{1+1}$ but has UV divergences in higher dimensions, which reveals a fundamental difference in the entanglement structure in different dimensions. When $(-1)^n I_n$ reaches the information-theoretical upper bound, we argue that ( I_n ) fully accounts for multipartite global entanglement in these upper bound critical points, in contrast to usual cases where $I_n$ is not a perfect measure for multipartite entanglement. We further show that these results suggest that fewer-partite entanglement fully emerges from more-partite entanglement, and any $n-1$ distant regions are fully $n$-partite entangling in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Duality in a 3D Field-Theoretic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the duality symmetry between the Abelian 1-form and 2-form basic gauge fields in the context of a three (2 + 1)-dimensional (3D) combined system of the field-theoretic model for the free Abelian 1-from and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism where the classical gauge-fixed Lagrangian density of this theory is generalized to its quantum counterpart as the BRST and co-BRST invariant Lagrangian density. We show clearly the existence of the off-shell nilpotent (co-)BRST symmetry transformations and establish their intimate connection through a set of underlying discrete duality symmetry transformations in our BRST-quantized theory. We briefly mention a bosonic symmetry transformation which is generated from the anticommutator of the above (co-)BRST symmetry transformations. We lay emphasis on the algebraic structures of the existing continuous as well as the discrete symmetry transformations in our theory (where they are treated as operators).</description>

      <title>Studying KARMA (Kerr And Relativistic Matter Around)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct series of solutions for the Kerr-type rotating black hole with non-trivial matter in flat and (A)dS backgrounds. Symmetry arguments and singularity analysis in the proposed black hole models fix the free parameters of the solutions, and the study of popular energy conditions makes it possible to impose constraints on configuration and field content of external matter. The resulted geometry of spacetimes is featured by a special type singularity in the north and south pole directions, inducing the bipolar outflow of particles from black holes. As a step toward the construction of a non-stationary rotating black hole solution in the presence of matter, we explore the zero angular momentum limit of the constructed metrics. The use of the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates allows us to find a generalization of the proposed construction to the Vaidya-type black hole. Finally, employing the Newman-Janis algorithm, we find the corresponding generalization of the Kerr-Vaidya black hole solution.</description>

      <title>Casimir stresses of the dielectric ball: inhomogeneity and divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Puzzles are still preventing people from further understanding and manipulating the Casimir interaction in spherical systems. Here we investigate the behaviors of Casimir stresses in the system consisting of a ball immersed in the background, emphasising the roles of spherical geometry and inhomogeneity. Spherical modes are employed to evaluate the Green's dyadic and thus the Casimir stresses. The inhomogeneity of the media essentially modifies the wave form of the spherical mode, leading to significant impacts on the Casimir stresses, especially when far away from the surface of the ball. As the surface approached, the divergence (surface divergence) in Casimir stresses is seen. For both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases, the leading behaviors (zero for the radial component, and inverse quantic order of distance for the transverse components) of Casimir stresses are exactly the same as those for the corresponding planar homogeneous wall, involving only properties of media at the surface and reflecting no information about the spherical geometry and the inhomogeneity, which implies the local nature. The other surface divergences are influenced by the spherical geometry, and for the transverse component always weaker than the planar contribution. The general impacts from the inhomogeneity of media to the surface divergences are also shown. The inhomogeneity will further soften the surface divergence. For two touching media with permittivities and permeabilities equal up to high enough order of their expansion over the distance to the surface, surface divergences may disappear together with the interaction Casimir stresses. Other factors, such as the refractivity and anisotropy, are also included, which may rise considerable complexities, but typically not related to divergences. Perspectives on the renormalization of the surface divergence are briefly outlined.</description>

      <title>Understanding zeros and splittings of ordered tree amplitudes via Feynman diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose new understandings for recently discovered hidden zeros and novel splittings, by utilizing Feynman diagrams. The study focus on ordered tree level amplitudes of three theories, which are ${\rm Tr}(\phi^3)$, Yang-Mills, and non-linear sigma model. We find three universal ways of cutting Feynman diagrams, which are valid for any diagram, allowing us to separate a full amplitude into two/three pieces. As will be shown, the first type of cuttings leads to hidden zeros, the second one gives rise to $2$-splits, while the third one corresponds to $3$-splits called smooth splittings. Throughout this work, we frequently use the helpful auxiliary technic of thinking the resulting pieces as in orthogonal spaces. However, final results are independent of this auxiliary picture.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics from General Relativity and the Quantum Friedmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the recently introduced linear form of the Friedmann equations corresponds to the first-order WKB expansion of a quantum cosmological equation, indicating that both General Relativity (GR) contains aspects of Quantum Mechanics (QM) and that GR itself is part of a more general theory. Solutions of this quantum Friedmann equation are built in terms of a quantum scale factor that encapsulates the quantum effects on a free-falling particle. The quantum-modified scale factor reshapes the dynamics of the universe, removing the singularity due to the vanishing of the scale factor. A detailed example within the radiation-dominated context illustrates how these quantum solutions connect to Seiberg-Witten theory, recently applied to black holes, and incorporate resurgence phenomena and complex metrics as developed by Kontsevich, Segal, and Witten. As a result, this reveals an invariance of time parametrization under $\Gamma(2)$ transformations of the wave function.</description>

      <title>(Quasi-)normal modes of rotating black holes and new solitons in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalar field (quasi-)normal modes of recently derived rotating black holes within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point in five dimensions. We also examine the mode spectrum of these probes on new static gravitational solitons. These solitons, featuring a regular center, are constructed from static black holes with gravitational hair via a double analytic continuation. By imposing ingoing boundary conditions at the horizons of rotating black holes, ensuring regularity at the soliton centers, and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions at infinity, we obtain numerical spectra for the rotating black holes and solitons. For static black holes, we demonstrate analytically that the imaginary part of the mode frequencies is negative. Our analysis of the massless Klein-Gordon equation on five-dimensional geometries reveals an infinite family of gapped, massive three-dimensional Klein-Gordon fields, despite the presence of a non-compact extended direction. For the static solitons, the frequencies are real and non-equispaced, whereas in the rotating black holes, counter-rotating modes are absorbed more quickly, and the imaginary part of the co-rotating modes approaches zero as extremality is approached. Additionally, we show that both the rotating black holes and solitons can be equipped with non-trivial torsion, leading to a novel branch of solutions.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for hydrodynamics with approximate symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic theories with approximate symmetries in the recently developed effective action approach on the Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) contour. We employ the method of spurious symmetry transformation for small explicit symmetry-breaking parameters to systematically constrain symmetry-breaking effects in the non-equilibrium effective action for hydrodynamics. We apply our method to the hydrodynamic theory of chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature and density and its explicit breaking by quark masses. We show that the spurious symmetry and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation dictate that the Ward-Takahashi identity for the axial symmetry, i.e., the partial conservation of axial vector current (PCAC) relation, contains a relaxational term proportional to the axial chemical potential, whose kinetic coefficient is at least of the second order in the quark mass. In the phase where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone pions appear as hydrodynamic variables, this relaxation effect is subleading compared to the conventional pion mass term in the PCAC relation, which is of the first order in the quark mass. On the other hand, in the chiral symmetry-restored phase, we show that our relaxation term, which is of the second order in the quark mass, becomes the leading contribution to the axial charge relaxation. Therefore, the leading axial charge relaxation mechanism is parametrically different in the quark mass across a chiral phase transition.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in a one-dimensional effective quantum-electrodynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aim of progressing toward a practical implementation of an effective quantum-electrodynamics (QED) theory of atoms and molecules, which includes the effects of vacuum polarization through the creation of virtual electron-positron pairs but without the explicit photon degrees of freedom, we study a one-dimensional effective QED model of the hydrogen-like atom with delta-potential interactions. This model resembles the three-dimensional effective QED theory with Coulomb interactions while being substantially simpler. We provide some mathematical details about the definition of this model, calculate the vacuum-polarization density, and the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy, correcting and extending results of previous works. We also study the approximation of the model in a finite plane-wave basis, and in particular we discuss the basis convergence of the bound-state energy and eigenfunction, of the vacuum-polarization density, and of the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy. We highlight the difficulty of converging the vacuum-polarization density in a finite basis and we propose a way to improve it. The present work could give hints on how to perform similar calculations for the three-dimensional effective QED theory of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>The Chirotropical Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in particle physics have revealed deep connections between scattering amplitudes and tropical geometry. At the heart of this relationship are the chirotropical Grassmannian $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(k,n)$ and chirotropical Dressian $\text{Dr}^\chi(k,n)$, polyhedral fans built from uniform realizable chirotopes that encode the combinatorial structure of generalized Feynman diagrams. We prove that $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(3,n) = \text{Dr}^\chi(3,n)$ for $n = 6,7,8$, and develop algorithms to compute these objects from their rays modulo lineality. Using these algorithms, we compute all chirotropical Grassmannians $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(3,n)$ for $n = 6,7,8$ across all isomorphism classes of chirotopes. We prove that each chirotopal configuration space $X^\chi(3,6)$ is diffeomorphic to a polytope with an associated canonical logarithmic differential form. Finally, we show that the equality between chirotropical Grassmannian and Dressian fails for $(k,n) = (4,8)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look at a new string$^h$ tangential structure first introduced by Devalapurkar and relate it to the $W_7=0$ condition of Diaconescu-Moore-Witten for type IIA string theory and M-theory. We show that a string$^h$ structure on the target space automatically satisfies the $W_7=0$ condition and we also explain when the $W_7=0$ condition gives rise to a string$^h$ structure. Devalapurkar initially constructed $MString^h$ in such a way that it orients $tmf_1(3)$, we extend Devalapurkar's orientation and show that $MString^h$ orients $tmf_1(n)$. We compute the homotopy groups of $MString^h$ in the dimensions relevant for physical applications, and apply them to anomaly cancellation applications for compactifications of type IIA string theory.</description>

      <title>New Physics Hiding at the Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is field space infinite? If not, it either loops back on itself or ends altogether. Periodic boundary conditions are of course familiar, but field space endpoints--which appear in real-world systems--are far less explored. In this paper we argue that boundaries in field space are generic, radiatively stable structures that allow for new physics at very low scales not ruled out by experiment. Such boundaries are delocalized in field space from the vacuum, so they can only be accessed by coherent fields or high multiplicity processes, both of which are weakly constrained observationally. Low multiplicity interactions do not detect the boundary and instead perceive a "mirage cutoff" that is parametrically higher than the true cutoff of the theory. Hence, field space boundaries are deformations of the standard model that are Lorentz invariant, local, unitary at low energies, and experimentally unconstrained. We comment on the possibility of field space boundaries on the long-range force carriers and the Higgs, as well as possible implications for the hierarchy problem.</description>

Abstract: We analyze existence and properties of solutions of two-dimensional general relativistic initial data sets with a negative cosmological constant, both on spacelike and characteristic surfaces. A new family of such vacuum, spacelike data parameterised by poles at the conformal boundary at infinity is constructed. We review the notions of global Hamiltonian charges, emphasising the difficulties arising in this dimension, both in a spacelike and characteristic setting. One or two, depending upon the topology, lower bounds for energy in terms of angular momentum, linear momentum, and center of mass are established.</description>

      <title>Machines and Mathematical Mutations: Using GNNs to Characterize Quiver Mutation Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in mathematics, enabling one to identify subtle patterns across collections of examples so vast that they would be impossible for a single researcher to feasibly review and analyze. In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate quiver mutation -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of mutation equivalence is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? Currently, this question has only been resolved in specific cases. In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to discover mutation equivalence criteria for the previously unknown case of quivers of type $\tilde{D}_n$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D_n$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and general rules from mathematical data.</description>

      <title>Imprints of black hole charge on the precessing jet nozzle of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed jet precession period of approximately 11 years for M87* strongly suggests the presence of a supermassive rotating black hole with a tilted accretion disk at the center of the galaxy. By modeling the motion of the tilted accretion disk particle with the spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole, we study the effect of charge on the observation of the precession period, thereby exploring the potential of this strong-gravity observation in constraining multiple black hole parameters. Firstly, we study the spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole and find that their precession periods increase with the charge. Secondly, we utilize the observed M87* jet precession period to constrain the relationship between the spin, charge, and warp radius, specifically detailing the correlations between each pair of these three quantities. Moreover, to further refine constraints on the charge, we explore the negative correlation between the maximum warp radius and charge. A significant result shows that the gap between the maximum warp radii of the prograde and retrograde orbits decrease with the black hole charge. If the warp radius is provided by other observations, different constraints on the charge can be derived for the prograde and retrograde cases. These results suggest that in the era of multi-messenger astronomy, such strong-gravity observation of precessing jet nozzle presents a promising avenue for constraining black hole parameters.</description>

      <title>Analytic decay width of the Higgs boson to massive bottom quarks at order $\alpha_s^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Higgs boson decay into bottom quarks is the dominant decay channel contributing to its total decay width, which can be used to measure the bottom quark Yukawa coupling and mass. This decay width has been computed up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^4)$ for the process induced by the bottom quark Yukawa coupling, assuming massless final states, and the corresponding corrections beyond $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ are found to be less than $0.2\%$. We present an analytical result for the decay into massive bottom quarks at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ that includes the contribution from the top quark Yukawa coupling induced process. We have made use of the optical theorem, canonical differential equations and the regular basis in the calculation and expressed the result in terms of multiple polylogarithms and elliptic functions. We propose a systematic and unified procedure to derive the $\epsilon$-factorized differential equation for the three-loop kite integral family, which includes the three-loop banana integrals as a sub-sector. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ corrections increase the decay width, relative to the result up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, by $1\%$ due to the large logarithms $\log^i (m_H^2/m_b^2)$ with $ 1\le i \le 4 $ in the small bottom quark mass limit. The coefficient of the double logarithms is proportional to $C_A-C_F$, which is the typical color structure in the resummation of soft quark contributions at subleading power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigates the massless scalar perturbations of the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski black hole considering the general case that admits all nonzero parameters. This case is the most generic black hole spacetime in general relativity, characterized by mass, spin, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, NUT parameter, and cosmological constant. Employing conformal transformations, we can separate the massless scalar field equation and reduce the effective potential in the radial perturbation equation into the P\"oschl--Teller potential in the near-Nariai limit where the event and cosmo-acceleration horizons are close. This allows us to obtain an exact analytical solution of the quasinormal frequency, implying that the decay rate of the field is quantized depending only on the surface gravity of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use the collapse metric obtained by Carneiro and Fabris to calculate the power spectrum associated to gauge invariant fluctuations of the metric during the formation of a primordial scalar black hole at the end of inflation. We assume that local perturbations in the vacuum energy density can collapse by means of the collapse of the local inflaton field, generating a singularity as shown by Carneiro and Fabris. Employing a representative term of the series expansion of the scale factor we obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for a second order approximation of the scale factor. Thus, the spectrum for scalar black holes obtained can be considered as a correction of the power spectrum of the primordial quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field.</description>

This paper introduces the first formally verified implementation of index notation in the interactive theorem prover Lean 4. By integrating index notation into Lean, we bridge the gap between traditional physics notation and formal verification tools, making it more accessible for physicists to write and prove results within Lean. We also open up a new avenue through which AI tools can be used to prove results related to tensors in physics. Behind the scenes our implementation leverages a novel application of category theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with a Minkowski false vacuum and an unbounded (or very deep) true vacuum. We show compelling evidence that an AdS bubble of vanishing total energy, embedded in asymptotically flat spacetime, generically undergoes a spherical collapse which leads to a space-like curvature singularity after the formation of trapped surfaces and apparent horizons. The crunch singularity, which is hided behind an apparent horizon, occurs before the true vacuum is reached, and the existence of a lower bound of the scalar field potential is not a necessary condition for its formation.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-Induced ALP Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-perturbative gravitational effects induce explicit global symmetry breaking terms within axion models. These exponentially suppressed terms in the potential give a mass contribution to the axion-like particles (ALPs). In this work we investigate this scenario with a scalar field charged under a global $U(1)$ symmetry and having a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Given the exponential dependence, the ALP can retain a mass spanning a wide range, which can act as a dark matter component. We specify pre-inflationary and post-inflationary production mechanisms of these ALPs, with the former from the misalignment mechanism and the latter from both the misalignment and cosmic-string decay. We identify the allowed parameter ranges that explain the dark matter abundance for both a general inflation case and a case where the radial mode scalar drives inflation, each in metric and Palatini formalisms. We show that the ALP can be the dominant component of the dark matter in a wide range of its mass, $m_{a} \in [10^{-21}~\mathrm{eV},\, \mathrm{TeV}]$, depending on the inflationary scenario and the $U(1)$ breaking scale. These results indicate that ALPs can be responsible for our dark matter abundance within a setup purely from non-perturbative gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal Dark Matter in $U(1)_{B-L}$ Extension of Inert Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) that explains both neutrino masses and dark matter (DM) in the intermediate-mass range by incorporating a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. This additional symmetry enables the inclusion of right-handed neutrinos, providing a natural mechanism for neutrino mass generation. While the CP-even component of the inert doublet can serve as a DM candidate, its thermal relic abundance is insufficient to match the observed DM density. To address this, we introduce a non-thermal production mechanism, where a heavy scalar associated with the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry decays into the inert doublet scalar, yielding a viable relic abundance at low reheating temperatures. We also examine both direct and indirect detection prospects for this DM candidate and assess the model against current experimental constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics of local causal horizons have been shown to encode the information necessary to derive the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We have previously shown that, in the presence of matter, this derivation further implies quantum phenomenological corrections to gravitational dynamics. Herein, we study whether similar corrections also occur in vacuum. We show that, under the assumptions of locality and local Lorentz invariance of physics, the vacuum dynamics is prescribed by the Einstein equations. We also discuss an alternative paradigm which assumes the existence of a preferred direction of time (much like in Einstein-aether or Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity). Then, we find an modified gravitational dynamics in which Ricci curvature is sourced by Bel-Robinson super-energy.</description>

Abstract: Infrared singularities in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are captured by the Soft function, which can be calculated efficiently using Feynman diagrams known as webs. The starting point for calculating Soft function using webs is to compute the web mixing matrices using a well known replica trick algorithm. We present a package implemented in Mathematica to calculate these mixing matrices. Along with the package, we provide several state-of-the art computations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Effects in Black Hole Ringdown Made Simple: Quasi-Normal Modes as Adiabatic Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear nature of general relativity manifests prominently throughout the merger of two black holes, from the inspiral phase to the final ringdown. Notably, the quasi-normal modes generated during the ringdown phase display significant nonlinearities. We show that these nonlinear effects can be effectively captured by zooming in on the photon ring through the Penrose limit. Specifically, we model the quasi-normal modes as null particles trapped in unstable circular orbits around the black holes and show that they can be interpreted as adiabatic modes, perturbations that are arbitrarily close to large diffeomorphisms. This enables the derivation of a simple analytical expression for the QNM nonlinearities for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes which reproduces well the existing numerical results.</description>

      <title>Berry curvature and spin-one color superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Berry curvature and topological aspects of a spin-one color superconductor. In the ultra-relativistic limit, the ground state is the color-spin locking phase (CSL) with the pairing between quarks of opposite chirality. Li and Haldane show that for generic Cooper pairs formed by Weyl fermions that carry opposite chirality, the gap function must have topologically protected nodes. However, the CSL phase has been known as a fully gapped system and lacks any nodes within one-flavor Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We present a general formulation relating the total topological number associated with the nodal structure and the monopole charges of the Berry curvature, including the color structure of the pair quarks. In the CSL phase, the contribution from the chirality, which is assumed to lead to the nodes within the conventional argument, is canceled out by the novel color contribution. Moreover, this non-trivial color Berry structure is manifested through the presence of gapless quasi-particles that exhibit the "color" helicity $\pm 1$, resulting in total monopole charges of $\pm 3/2$ rather than $\pm 1/2$ of a single Weyl fermion.</description>

Abstract: It is known from Zhu's results that under modular transformations, correlators of rational $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebras transform like Jacobi forms.
  We investigate the modular transformation properties of VOA correlators that have zero modes inserted. We derive recursion relations for such correlators and use them to establish modular transformation properties. We find that correlators with only zero modes transform like quasi-modular forms, and mixed correlators with both zero modes and vertex operators transform like quasi-Jacobi forms. As an application of our results, we introduce algebras of higher weight fields whose zero mode correlators mimic the properties of those of weight 1 fields. We also give a simplified proof of the weight 1 transformation properties originally proven by Miyamoto.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate Friedmann's equations as second-order linear differential equations. This is done using techniques related to the Schwarzian derivative that selects the $\beta$-times $t_\beta:=\int^t a^{-2\beta}$, where $a$ is the scale factor. In particular, it turns out that Friedmann's equations are equivalent to the eigenvalue problems $$ O_{1/2} \Psi=\frac{\Lambda}{12}\Psi \ , \qquad O_1 a =\frac{\Lambda}{3} a \ , $$ which is suggestive of a measurement problem. $O_{\beta}(\rho,p)$ are space-independent Klein-Gordon operators, depending only on energy density and pressure, and related to the Klein-Gordon Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The $O_\beta$'s are also independent of the spatial curvature, labeled by $k$, and absorbed in $$ \Psi=\sqrt a e^{\frac{i}{2}\sqrt{k}\eta} \ . $$ The above pair of equations is the unique possible linear form of Friedmann's equations unless $k=0$, in which case there are infinitely many pairs of linear equations. Such a uniqueness just selects the conformal time $\eta\equiv t_{1/2}$ among the $t_\beta$'s, which is the key to absorb the curvature term. An immediate consequence of the linear form is that it reveals a new symmetry of Friedmann's equations in flat space.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the interrelations between several ideas in quantum gravity -- holography, the Swampland, and the concept of ensemble averaging. To do so, we study ensemble averages of Narain-type theories associated with general even quadratic forms and their holographic duals. We establish the emergence of global symmetries and discuss their consistency with conjectures forbidding such symmetries. We also discuss how the spectral decomposition of Narain partition functions suggests a natural embedding of ensemble averaging within the low-energy limit of certain string compactifications, which in turn allows a connection with the Swampland program.</description>

      <title>Taking the Null-Hypersurface Limit in the Parikh-Wilczek Membrane Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider subtleties of the horizon (null-hypersurface) limit in the Parikh-Wilczek Membrane Approach to Black Holes. Specifically, we refine the correspondence between the projected Einstein equations of gravity with matter and the Raychaudhuri-Damour-Navier-Stokes (RDNS) equations of relativistic hydrodynamics. For a general configuration of gravity with matter we obtain additional terms in the hydrodynamic equations, which include very specific combinations of the contracted logarithmic derivatives of a parameter (the regularization function) determining the proximity of a stretched membrane to the black hole horizon. Nevertheless, direct computations of the new terms for exact (Schwarzschild and Kerr) black hole solutions prompt the standard form of the RDNS equations, due to the non-expanding horizon property of these solutions. Therefore, the reduction of the extended RDNS equations to their classical form may be viewed as an additional consistency condition in the exact black hole solutions hydrodynamics, and may serve as a non-trivial test for various viable approximations of spacetime metrics. We compare in detail the Parikh-Wilczek Membrane Approach with the Gourgoulhon-Jaramillo method of a null-hypersurface description, as well as give the link of the obtained results to our previous work on the Kerr black holes.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a novel family of boundary conditions for AdS$_3$ General Relativity, constructed through a polynomial expansion in negative integer powers of the Brown-Henneaux central charge. The associated dynamics is governed by the Dym hierarchy of integrable equations. It is shown that the infinite set of Dym conserved charges generates an abelian asymptotic symmetry group. Additionally, these boundary conditions encompass black hole solutions, whose thermodynamic properties are examined.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of non-compact backgrounds of Type IIB string theory preserving eight supercharges by combining S-folds and non-perturbative 7-branes wrapping orbifolds, and study the four-dimensional superconformal field theories arising at low energy on $D3$-branes probing them. We draw a precise correspondence between this setup and the torus compactification of six-dimensional orbi-instanton theories with a Stiefel-Whitney twist, and use it to determine the main features of such strongly-coupled systems, like central charges, spectra of Coulomb-branch operators, networks of Higgs-branch flows. Finally, with the aim to improve our understanding of the landscape of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories, and possibly to extend their classification beyond rank two, we provide a detailed catalogue of all the rank-three theories that our framework gives access to.</description>

Abstract: We construct new continuous families of ${\rm AdS}_3\times S^3\times {\rm T}^4$ and ${\rm AdS}_3\times S^3\times S^3\times S^1$ solutions in heterotic and type II supergravities. These families are found in three-dimensional consistent truncations and controlled by 17 parameters, which include TsT $\beta$ deformations and encompass several supersymmetric sub-families. The different uplifts are constructed in a unified fashion by means of Exceptional Field Theory (ExFT). This allows the computation of the Kaluza-Klein spectra around the deformations, to test the stability of the solutions, and to interpret them holographically and as worldsheet models. To achieve this, we describe how the half-maximal ${\rm SO}(8,8)$ ExFT can be embedded into ${\rm E}_{8(8)}$ ExFT.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Patel et.al introduced a higher dimensional version of the SYK model with random coupling in Yukawa interaction to find the linear-$T$ resistivity. We test the universality of the mechanism by replacing the scalar with vector field in various dimensions. We find that it works for vector as well as scalar interaction, although the details are very different. However, this mechanism for the linear-$T$ resistivity works only in $(2+1)$ dimension not in higher dimension independent of the interaction type. Based on these results, we explore the role of spatial random disorder and find a simple understanding how such random scattering converts the Fermi liquid to the strange metal by changing the behavior of the self-energies of involved boson and fermion.</description>

      <title>6d Large Charge and 2d Virasoro Blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute observables in the interacting rank-one 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ SCFT at large R-charge. We focus on correlators involving $\Phi^n$, namely symmetric products of the bottom component of the supermultiplet containing the stress-tensor. By using the moduli space effective action and methods from the large-charge expansion, we compute the OPE coefficients $\langle\Phi^n\Phi^m\Phi^{n+m}\rangle$ in an expansion in 1/n. The coefficients of the expansion are only partially determined from the 6d perspective, but we manage to fix them order-by-order in 1/n numerically by utilizing the 6d/2d correspondence. This is made possible by the fact that this $6d$ observable can be extracted in 2d from a specific double-scaling limit of the vacuum Virasoro block, which can be efficiently computed numerically. We also extend the computation to higher-rank SCFTs, and discuss various applications of our results to 6d as well as 2d.</description>

      <title>Timelike-bounded $dS_4$ holography from a solvable sector of the $T^2$ deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has leveraged the tractability of $T\bar T$ style deformations to formulate timelike-bounded patches of three-dimensional bulk spacetimes including $dS_3$. This proceeds by breaking the problem into two parts: a solvable theory that captures the most entropic energy bands, and a tuning algorithm to treat additional effects and fine structure. We point out that the method extends readily to higher dimensions, and does not require factorization of the full $T^2$ operator (the higher dimensional analogue of $T\bar T$ defined in [1]). Focusing on $dS_4$, we first define a solvable theory at finite $N$ via a restricted $T^2$ deformation of the $CFT_3$ on ${S}^2\times \mathbb{R}$, in which $T$ is replaced by the form it would take in symmetric homogeneous states, containing only diagonal energy density $E/V$ and pressure (-$dE/dV$) components. This defines a finite-N solvable sector of $dS_4/\text{deformed-CFT}_3$, capturing the radial geometry and count of the entropically dominant energy band, reproducing the Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a state count. To accurately capture local bulk excitations of $dS_4$ including gravitons, we build a deformation algorithm in direct analogy to the case of $dS_3$ with bulk matter recently proposed in [2]. This starts with an infinitesimal stint of the solvable deformation as a regulator. The full microscopic theory is built by adding renormalized versions of $T^2$ and other operators at each step, defined by matching to bulk local calculations when they apply, including an uplift from $AdS_4/CFT_3$ to $dS_4$ (as is available in hyperbolic compactifications of M theory). The details of the bulk-local algorithm depend on the choice of boundary conditions; we summarize the status of these in GR and beyond, illustrating our method for the case of the cylindrical Dirichlet condition which can be UV completed by our finite quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in random tensor networks III: triway cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For general random tensor network states at large bond dimension, we prove that the integer R\'enyi reflected entropies (away from phase transitions) are determined by minimal triway cuts through the network. This generalizes the minimal cut description of bipartite entanglement for these states. A natural extrapolation away from integer R\'enyi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions (QED$_3$) with two Dirac fermions displays time reversal symmetry, nontrivial SPT phases and anomalies. The fate of this theory in its strongly coupled regime has been debated extensively. Surprisingly, we find that gluing together the phase diagrams of two standard Wilson-Fisher $O(4)$ theories suffices to reproduce all the SPT phases, anomalies, and semi-classical limits. A central mechanism behind it is ``SPT absorption''. The patching of the $O(4)$ transitions makes very concrete predictions for the behavior of the theory in its strongly coupled limits; for instance, the $\theta=\pi$ sigma model with $S^3$ topology appears due to monopole condensation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to string sigma model whose target space is a T-dualized system from an integrable bi-hermitian space with isometry. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized almost complex structures keep integrable even though they become no longer covariantly constant. We also observe that the form of $H$-flux is suitable for string compactification scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unitarity through PT symmetry in Quantum Quadratic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theories described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are known to possess strictly positive energy eigenvalues and exhibit unitary time evolution if the Hamiltonian is symmetric under discrete parity and time (PT) transformation. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum quadratic gravity, a theory that generally violates unitarity when viewed as a Hermitian quantum field theory, can be complex-deformed into such a PT-symmetric theory with an action that consists of a ghost-less Hermitian free part and non-Hermitian interactions. Paying special attention to the gauge symmetry present in the theory, we quantize in the covariant operator formalism after suggesting how the framework might be extended to the pseudo-Hermitian picture. We find compelling evidence that the resulting quantum theory possesses a unitary inner product and a sensible interpretation of quantum probability, thus avoiding the ghost problem present in the Hermitian formulation of quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$.
  The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality.
  In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha &lt; 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Bulk and Branes: Symmetry TFT of 6D SCFTs from IIB/F-theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the 7D Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) associated to a 6D SCFT from the IIB/F-theory geometric engineering approach. The 6D (2,0) or (1,0) SCFT is constructed from IIB on a non-compact complex surface possibly with 7-branes. We derive the general form of 7D SymTFT actions from the compactification of IIB action on the boundary link of the base manifold of an elliptic Calabi-Yau threefold, for both the cases with or without flavor 7-branes intersecting the boundary link. Along the way we found new terms in the SymTFT action from the worldvolume action of flavor 7-branes involving the flavor center symmetries. We crosscheck the results against those obtained from either holographic constructions or the dual M-theory picture. Our construction potentially leads to a classification of the 7D SymTFTs which parallels the known geometric classification of the 6D SCFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A huge progress in studying holographic theories is that holography can be interpreted via the quantum error correction, which makes equal the entanglement wedge reconstruction, the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh formula, the radial commutativity and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We call the equivalence the reconstruction theorem, whose infinite-dimensional generalization via algebraic language was believed to exclude the algebraic version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. However, recent developments regarding gravitational algebras have shown that the inclusion of the algebraic Ryu-Takayanagi formula is plausible. In this letter, we prove that such inclusion holds for the cases of type I/II factors, which are expected to describe holographic theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computation of two-loop amplitudes for the production of multiple Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons via gluon fusion with exact dependence on quark masses relies primarily on numerical methods. We propose a framework that enables their numerical evaluation in momentum space. The method is inspired by the factorization of infrared divergences in QCD scattering amplitudes. It extends techniques introduced for electroweak gauge boson production from quark-antiquark annihilation to processes with external gluons. By combining diagrammatic integrands, we make use of local cancellations between diagrams that automatically eliminate most non-factoring infrared singularities. With a limited number of counterterms, we then derive two-loop integrands for which all soft and collinear singularities factorize locally. We hope that the local subtraction techniques presented in this article will play a useful role in extending the local factorization formalism to two-loop amplitudes for arbitrary processes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ in Euclidean spacetime in an effective-model approach. The model incorporates two Polyakov loops along two compactified directions as dynamical variables, and is constructed to reproduce thermodynamics on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ measured on the lattice. The model analysis indicates the existence of a novel first-order phase transition on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ in the deconfined phase, which terminates at critical points that should belong to the two-dimensional $Z_2$ universality class. We argue that the interplay of the Polyakov loops induced by their cross term in the Polyakov-loop potential is responsible for the manifestation of the first-order transition.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Bulk Fields: No-Go Conjectures for Braneworld Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a series of no-go conjectures that impose rigorous constraints on the localization of bulk fields in braneworld scenarios, specifically affecting gauge and spinor fields within five-dimensional spacetimes. Our approach differs from traditional methods as it does not rely on specific equations of motion, making our results broadly applicable across various braneworld models. These no-go conditions reveal fundamental limitations in field localization, challenging the feasibility of embedding fields on the brane. For instance, our analysis demonstrates that existing models fail to achieve consistent localization for gauge and spinor fields. Additionally, one of our conditions indicates that the effective Lagrangian on the brane cannot exhibit conformal invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a new class of modified gravity models, that is, generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models, whose action is characterized by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $f(R, {}^*RR)$. Within this framework, we derive the gravitational field equations and solve them for a particular model, $f(R, {}^*RR)=R+\beta ({}^*RR)^2$, considering two ansatzes: the slowly rotating metric and first-order perturbations of G\"{o}del-type metrics. For the former, we find a first-order correction to the frame-dragging effect boosted by the parameter $L$, which characterizes the departures from general relativity results. For the latter, G\"{o}del-type metrics hold unperturbed. We conclude this paper by displaying that generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models admit a scalar-tensor representation, whose explicit form presents two scalar fields: $\Phi$, a dynamical degree of freedom, while the second, $\vartheta$, a non-dynamical degree of freedom. In particular, the scalar field $\vartheta$ emerges coupled with the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $\vartheta {}^*RR$, which is nothing more than Chern-Simons term.</description>

Abstract: We employ the isomonodromic method to study linear scalar massive perturbations of Kerr black holes for generic scalar masses $M\mu$ and generic black hole spins $a/M$. We find that the longest-living quasinormal mode and the first overtone coincide for $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$. We also show that the longest-living mode and the first overtone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around the point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric phase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a thermodynamic analogy.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of pions are calculated from a top-down holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) approach with momentum transfer dependence for the first time. It is important because the GFFs of hadrons have information on the internal stress distribution that may provide insight into the mechanism of how QCD forms hadrons. The forward limit value of this GFFs, i.e. the D-term, was also obtained. Furthermore, in this approach, we observe the so-called glueball dominance, in which pions have gravitational interactions via infinite glueball spectra.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar perturbations in Kerr Black Holes: near extremal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of massive scalar perturbations in Kerr black holes using the isomonodromic method. For arbitrary scalar masses $M \mu$ and black hole spins $a/M$, we numerically determine the quasinormal frequencies for various orbital $\ell$, azimuthal $m$, and overtone $n$ numbers. In particular, we derive an analytic expression for frequencies of the zero-damping modes near the extremal limit $a/M \rightarrow 1$. For $\ell=m=1$, we reveal that the fundamental mode becomes a damped mode (rather than a zero-damping mode) if the scalar field is sufficiently heavy. By exploring the parameter space, we find numerical evidence for level-crossing between the longest-living mode and the first overtone at an exceptional point $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$.</description>

      <title>Crystallography, Group Cohomology, and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the mod-2 cohomology ring for three-dimensional (3D) space groups and establish a connection between them and the lattice structure of crystals with space group symmetry. This connection allows us to obtain a complete set of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints, specifying the conditions under which a unique, symmetric, gapped ground state cannot exist in 3D lattice magnets. We associate each of these constraints with an element in the third mod-2 cohomology of the space group, when the internal symmetry acts on-site and its projective representations are classified by powers of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We demonstrate the relevance of our results to the study of $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids on the 3D pyrochlore lattice. We determine, through anomaly matching, the symmetry fractionalization patterns of both electric and magnetic charges, extending previous results from projective symmetry group classifications.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the pseudoscalar operator at four loops in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the renormalization constant of the pseudoscalar operator defined with a non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$ in dimensional regularization up to four-loop order in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Furthermore, by virtue of renormalization-group invariance of the relation between the scalar and the pseudoscalar operator, we predict the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ factor of the renormalization constant for the latter at five-loop order in QCD.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons Induced Thermal Friction on Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and interactions of the solitonic domain walls that occur in realistic axion electrodynamics models including the Chern-Simons interaction, $a\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\sigma}$, between an axion $a(x)$ of mass $m_a$, and a massless U(1) gauge field, e.g. EM, interacting with strength $\alpha=e^2/4\pi$ with charged matter, e.g. electron-positron pairs. In particular, in the presence of a U(1) gauge-and-matter relativistic thermal plasma we study the friction experienced by the walls due to the Chern-Simons term. Utilizing the linear response method we include the collective effects of the plasma, as opposed to purely particle scattering across the wall (as is done in previous treatments) which is valid only in the thin wall regime that is rarely applicable in realistic cases. We show that the friction depends on the Lorentz-$\gamma$-factor-dependent inverse thickness of the wall in the plasma frame, $\ell^{-1} \sim \gamma m_a$, compared to the three different plasma scales, the temperature $T$, the Debye mass $m_D\sim\sqrt{\alpha} T$, and the damping rate $\Gamma \sim \alpha^2 T$, and elucidate the underlying physical intuition for this behavior. (For friction in the thin-wall-limit we correct previous expressions in the literature.) We further consider the effects of long-range coherent magnetic fields that are possibly present in the early universe and compare their effect with that of thermal magnetic fields. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible early universe consequences of our results for domain wall motion and network decay, stochastic gravitational wave production from domain wall networks, and possible primordial black hole production from domain wall collapse, though a more complete discussion of these topics is reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Barrow Cosmology and Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using thermodynamics-gravity conjecture, we present the formal derivation of the modified Friedmann equations inspired by the Barrow entropy, $S\sim A ^{1+\delta/2}$, where $0\leq\delta\leq 1$ is the Barrow exponent and $A$ is the horizon area. We then constrain the exponent $\delta$ by using Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) observational data. In order to impose the upper bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$, we set the observational bound on $\left| \frac{\delta T_f} {T_f }\right|$. We find out that the Barrow parameter $\delta$ should be around $ \delta \simeq 0.01$ in order not to spoil the BBN era. Next we derive the bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$ in a different approach in which we analyze the effects of Barrow cosmology on the primordial abundances of light elements i.e. Helium $_{}^{4}\textit{He}$, Deuterium $D$ and Lithium $_{}^{7}\textit{Li}$. We observe that the deviation from standard Bekenstein-Hawking expression is small as expected. Additionally we present the relation between cosmic time $t$ and temperature $T$ in the context of modified Barrow cosmology. We confirm that the temperature of the early universe increases as the Barrow exponent $\delta$ (fractal structure of the horizon) increases, too.</description>
