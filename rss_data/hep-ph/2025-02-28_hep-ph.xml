      <title>Comment on "Dark Energy from Time Crystals"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently proposed (arxiv:2502.08887) that the time crystal Lagrangian introduced by Shapere and Wilczek in 2012 could be a model of dark energy. I point out that the model has an instability that drives its energy density to negative values, which may render it unsuitable as a model of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Nucleus Cross Section Impacts on Neutrino Oscillation Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenges in neutrino-nucleus cross section modeling and its impact on neutrino oscillation experiments are widely recognized. However, a comprehensive and theoretically robust estimation of cross section uncertainties has been lacking, and few studies have quantitatively examined their impact on oscillation measurements. In this work, we evaluate the effect of cross section uncertainties on oscillation parameters using setups inspired by NOvA and DUNE. To characterize these uncertainties, we adopt multiple neutrino-nucleus event generators and simulate a realistic experimental procedure that incorporates near-detector data and near-to-far-detector extrapolation. Our results confirm that cross section uncertainties cannot significantly bias oscillation results in current statistics-dominated experiments like NOvA. However, they could lead to substantial bias for future systematics-dominated experiments like DUNE, even when near-detector data are employed to mitigate uncertainties. These findings underscore the need for further studies on the quantitative impacts of cross section modeling, improved strategies to utilize near-detector data and the PRISM concept, and more robust cross section models to optimize the success of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Detecting Supernova Axions with IAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of IAXO and its intermediate version, BabyIAXO, to detect axions produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Our study demonstrates that these experiments have realistic chances of identifying SN axions, offering crucial insights into both axion physics and SN dynamics. IAXO's sensitivity to SN axions allows for the exploration of regions of the axion parameter space inaccessible through solar observations. In addition, in the event of a nearby SN, $d \sim O(100)$ pc, and sufficiently large axion couplings, $g_{a \gamma} \gtrsim 10^{-11} GeV^{-1}$, IAXO could have a chance to significantly advance our understanding of axion production in nuclear matter and provide valuable information about the physics of SNe, such as pion abundance, the equation of state, and other nuclear processes occurring in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV dark matter and nano-Hertz gravitational waves from a classically conformal dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong first-order phase transitions in a dark sector offer a compelling explanation for the stochastic gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz range recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We explore the possibility that such a phase transition at the same time gives mass to a stable fermion that accounts for the observed dark matter abundance and leads to testable effects in laboratory experiments. Concretely, we consider a classically conformal dark sector with a hidden $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry that couples to the Standard Model via kinetic mixing. Since the PTA signal requires a phase transition in the MeV temperature range, spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a sub-GeV dark matter candidate that couples to the Standard Model via a dark photon mediator and obtains its relic abundance via annihilations into electrons and dark Higgs bosons. Such a scenario is tightly constrained by laboratory searches for dark photons and cosmological constraints on the decays of dark Higgs bosons after the phase transition. We show that viable parameter regions can be found both for the case that the dark Higgs bosons remain in equilibrium with the Standard Model and that they decouple and only decay much later. In the latter case, the parameter regions preferred by the PTA signal and the dark matter relic abundance can be fully explored by future beam-dump experiments searching for missing energy.</description>

      <title>Misconceptions in Neutrino Oscillations in presence of a non-Unitary Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deviations from unitarity of the CKM matrix in the quark sector are considered excellent windows to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. In its leptonic counterpart, the PMNS matrix, these searches are particularly motivated, as the new physics needed to generate neutrino masses often leads to non-unitary mixing among the standard neutrinos. It is then interesting to consider how neutrino oscillations are affected in such scenario. This simple question is, however, subject to several subtleties: What is the correct way to define oscillation probabilities for a non-unitary mixing matrix? Do these probabilities add up to one? Does a non-unitary mixing matrix lead to observable flavor transitions at zero distance? What is the interplay between unitarity constraints obtained from neutrino oscillations and from electroweak precision data? This work aims to shed light on these issues and to clarify the corresponding misconceptions commonly found in the literature. We also compile updated bounds from neutrino oscillation searches to compare with those from flavour and electroweak precision observables.</description>

      <title>Extended IDM theory with low scale seesaw mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an extension of the inert doublet model in which the CP-phases in the weak sector are generated from one-loop level corrections mediated by dark fields, while the strong-CP phase arises at three-loop. In this framework, the tiny masses of the active neutrinos are produced through a radiative inverse seesaw mechanism at a two-loop level, the masses of the first and second families of SM-charged fermions arise from a one-loop level radiative seesaw mechanism, and the third generation of SM charged fermion masses are generated at tree level. We have demonstrated that the proposed model successfully accounts for SM fermion masses and mixings. The radiative nature of the seesaw mechanisms is attributed to preserved discrete symmetries, which are required for ensuring the stability of fermionic and scalar dark matter candidates. The preserved discrete symmetries also allow for multi-component dark matter, whose annihilation processes permits to successfully reproduce the measured amount of dark matter relic abundance for an appropriate region of parameter space, which has shown to be compatible with current dark matter direct detection limits. Besides that, we explore the model's ability to explain the $95$ GeV diphoton excess observed by the CMS collaboration, showing that it readily accommodates this anomaly. We have shown that charged lepton flavor violating decays acquire rates within the current experimental sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Experimental Constraints on $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ Multi-Component Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate extensions of the Standard Model (SM) featuring two-component scalar dark matter (DM) stabilized by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ symmetry. We focus on three specific cases, $\mathbb{Z}_4$, $\mathbb{Z}_6(23)$, and $\mathbb{Z}_6(13)$, each with a complex and a real scalar singlet. Through detailed numerical scans, we explore the viable parameter space, imposing constraints from DM relic abundance (Planck), direct detection (XENON1T, LZ, PandaX-4T), vacuum stability, perturbative unitarity, and coupling perturbativity up to the GUT and Planck scales, using one-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs). Our results demonstrate that these $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ models can provide viable two-component DM scenarios, consistent with all imposed constraints, for a range of DM masses and couplings. We identify the key parameters controlling the DM phenomenology and highlight the importance of a combined analysis incorporating both theoretical and experimental bounds.</description>

      <title>Axion Portal to Scalar Dark Matter: Unveiling Stabilizing Symmetry Footprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of an axion-like particle (ALP) as a portal between the dark and visible sectors. Unlike conventional studies, which typically assume fermionic dark matter (DM), we explore the phenomenological implications of scalar DM within this ALP portal framework. A key challenge arises from the fact that the interaction between the ALP spacetime derivative and the spin-one current of the scalar DM can be a redundant operator, which may be removed via a field redefinition. However, this interaction reveals a profound connection to the underlying global symmetry that stabilizes the DM particle. We choose a non-Abelian discrete symmetry, ensuring the persistence of the DM-ALP interactions, and in doing so, unveil a rich phenomenology. Working within a general effective field theory approach, we identify the following hallmark features of our scenario: (i) a relic density determined by semi-annihilations, with an abundance independent of ALP couplings to the visible sector; (ii) direct detection rates naturally suppressed; (iii) indirect detection spectra enriched relative to pure annihilation scenarios, with rates also independent of ALP couplings to visible particles. Lastly, we discuss potential microscopic origins for this framework and highlight the broader implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Dynamical $\mathbf{O(4)}$-Symmetry in the Light Meson Spectrum within the Framework of the Regge Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light mesons tend to cluster near certain values of mass. As was noticed almost twenty years ago, the emergent degeneracy is of the same type as the dynamical $O(4)$-symmetry of the Coulomb potential in the hydrogen atom. The meson mass spectrum can be well approximated by the linear Regge trajectories of the kind $M^2=al+bn_r+c$, where $l$ and $n_r$ are angular momentum and radial quantum numbers and $a$, $b$, $c$ are parameters. Such a spectrum arises naturally within the hadron string models. Using 2024 data from the Particle Data Group, various fits for $M^2(l,n_r)$ were performed. Our analysis seems to confirm that $a\approx b$ in the light non-strange mesons, i.e., their masses depend on the sum $l+n_r$ as prescribed by the hydrogen-like $O(4)$-symmetry. Using the semiclassical approximation, we discuss on a simple qualitative level which kind of string-like semirelativistic approaches are more favored by the experimental data.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we extend the supersymmetric SU(5) GUTs with the Nelson-Barr (NB) models. The NB models are a candidate for the solution of the strong CP problem. We show that the parameters in the CKM matrix are reproduced while the mass ratios of the down-type quarks and leptons in the second and third generations are explained in the minimal extension.</description>

      <title>Effective range expansion with the left-hand cut and its application to the $T_{cc}(3875)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The validity range of the widely used traditional effective range expansion can be severely limited by the presence of a left-hand cut near the two-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut emerges in two-particle scattering processes involving either a light particle exchange in the $t$-channel or a particle exchange with a mass slightly heavier than the mass difference of the two particles in the $u$-channel, which occurs in a wide range of physical systems. We propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that incorporates these left-hand cuts arising from particle exchange diagrams. This parameterization extends the convergence radius of the effective range expansion beyond the branch point of the left-hand cut and is applicable to a broad range of systems. The parameterization enables the extraction of coupling strengths between the exchange particle and the scattering particles, and reveals amplitude zeros resulting from the interplay between short- and long-range interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new parameterization through its application to $DD^*$ scattering with meson masses obtained in a lattice QCD calculation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) factorization, we calculate the next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD corrections to the form factors for the semileptonic decays of $B_c^*$ into $J/\psi$ via (axial-)vector and (axial-)tensor currents. We obtain the complete analytical results for the form factors up to NLO, and provide their asymptotic expressions in the hierarchical heavy quark limit. The NLO corrections are found to be both significant and convergent in the relatively small squared transfer momentum ($q^2$) region, while also reducing the dependence on the renormalization scale $\mu$. Finally, the theoretical predictions for $B_c^*\to J/\psi$ form factors over the full $q^2$ range are provided.</description>

      <title>Radiative decays of $X(3872)$ in $D{\bar D}^*$ molecule scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radiative decays of the $X(3872)$ to $\gamma V~(V=\rho^0,\, \omega)$ in the molecule scenario, where the $X(3872)$ is regarded as a pure hadronic molecule of the $D\bar{D}^*+c.c$ in an $S$-wave with the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{++}$. The radiative processes were assumed to occur via the triangle hadronic loops, and the relevant calculations were conducted using an effective Lagrangian approach. It is found that the absolute decay widths are model-dependent, but the relative width ratio is rather independent of the model parameter. Moreover, the calculated results indicate that the radiative decays of the $X(3872)$ are strongly influenced by the molecular configuration characterized by the proportion of the charged and neutral constituents. We hope that the present calculations could be tested by the experimental measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new approach for high loop integrals has been proposed in \cite{Huang:2024nij}, where the whole parameter integration has been divided into two parts: a one-loop-like integration and the remaining parameter integration. In this paper, we systematically study the one-loop-like integrals. We establish the IBP relations for the integral family and show how to complete the reduction. We find the canonical master integrals and write down the corresponding canonical differential equations.</description>

Abstract: This talk discusses short-distance contributions to the hadronic light-by-light part of the muon g-2 as in the Standard Model. A short discussion about the theory prediction is followed by the status of our work. The main new results since the previous chiral dynamics workshop is how to calculate the higher order corrections to the Melnikov-Vainshtein region using the operator product expansion. We work out fully the next order in the OPE, $D=4$, including photon and gluon only operators.
  In addition we briefly discuss the ongoing work on gluonic corrections to the next-order and nonperturbative estimates.</description>

      <title>Probing light mediators with recent PandaX-4T low energy electron recoil data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos elastically scattered off atomic electrons offer a unique opportunity to probe the Standard Model (SM) and beyond SM physics. In this work, we examine the new physics effects of light mediators through elastic neutrino-electron scattering using solar neutrinos at the low energy range of PandaX-4T. These mediators, with a mass less than $1$ GeV, are common properties of extensions to the SM. Accordingly, we consider universal light mediator models involving scalar, vector, and tensor interactions allowed by Lorentz invariance, and the anomaly-free $U(1)'$ extensions of the SM with a new vector mediator such as the $L_e-L_\mu$, $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge models in which the charges are exclusively leptonic. The new physics effects are analyzed by embedding each model into the SM process using solar neutrino flux. We obtain novel constraints on the coupling-mass plane of these models from the latest Run0 and Run1 datasets of the PandaX-4T experiment. We also compare our results with other limits derived from various terrestrial and astrophysical experiments. Our analysis results reveal more stringent limits in some regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Spin 1 Transverse Momentum Dependent Tensor Structure Functions in CLAS12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to analyze CLAS12 RG-C data to study the tensor transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) on deuteron data. The deuteron is the lightest nucleus with spin-1, in essence a weakly bound system of two spin-1/2 nucleons. However, one of the most intriguing characteristics of the deuteron is that the tensor polarized structure provides direct access to the quark and gluon distribution of light nuclear system, which cannot be naively constructed from the proton and neutron. We will study the tensor polarized structure functions with the Semi-inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) $eD \arrow eP_{h}X$ and Inclusive processes in the available data on deuterated ammonia (ND3) target. We will perform the first ever SIDIS analysis extraction of the tensor structure functions, which can be interpreted in term of completely unexplored tensor polarized TMDs. Our analysis will focus on the extraction of the tensor structure functions b1 from inclusive process, and $F_{U(LL),T}$ and $F^{cos 2\phi_{h}}_{U(LL)}$ from SIDIS. These last two structure functions carry information related to two tensor-polarized TMDs, $f_{1LL}$ and $h^{\perp}_{1LL}$. These initial exploratory measurements of tensor-polarized structure functions will enable the first extraction of spin-1 TMDs and motivate more precise future measurements.</description>

      <title>Planar Property and Long-range Azimuthal Correlation in $e^+e^-$ Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $e^+e^-$ annihilation of unpolarized beams is free from initial hadron states or initial anisotropy around the azimuthal angle, hence ideal for studying the correlations of dynamical origin via final state jets. We investigate the planar properties of the multi-jet events employing the relevant event-shape observables at next-to-next-to-leading order ($\mathcal{O}$($\alpha_{s}^{3}$)) in perturbative QCD; particularly, the azimuthal angle correlations on the long pseudo-rapidity (polar angle) range (Ridge correlation) between the inclusive jet momenta are calculated. We illustrate the significant planar properties and the strong correlations which are natural results of the energy-momentum conservation of the perturbative QCD radiation dynamics. Our study provides benchmarks of hard strong interaction background for the investigations on the collective and/or thermal effects via the Ridge-like correlation observables for complex scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on lepton flavor universal and non-universal New Physics in $b\, \to\, s\, \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays: a global SMEFT survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FCNC semileptonic decays of B mesons provide an excellent platform for indirectly probing New Physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model (SM). Although precise tests of lepton flavor universality (LFU), such as the ratios $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$, are consistent with the SM predictions, other observables in $b \to s \ell \bar{\ell}$ transitions show significant deviations. Specifically, discrepancies are observed in the individual branching fractions $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K^+ \mu^+ \mu^-)$ and $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K^+ e^+ e^-)$, as well as in $\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to K^{0*} \mu^+ \mu^-)$ and $\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to K^{0*} e^+ e^-)$. Furthermore, the angular observable $P'_5$ in $B \to K^{*} \mu^+ \mu^-$ shows a deviation of $3.3\sigma$ from the SM expectation, while a $3.6\sigma$ discrepancy has been reported in $\mathcal{B}(B_s \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-)$. For the first time, LHCb has measured $R_\phi$ through the $\mathcal{B}(B_s \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-)$ and $\mathcal{B}(B_s \to \phi e^+ e^-)$. Although $R_\phi$ aligns with the SM prediction, the individual branching fractions remain inconsistent with SM results. These anomalies point to the potential presence of NP in both the muon and electron sectors. Although current experimental constraints on $b\, \to\, s\, e\, \bar{e}$ decays are less stringent than their muonic counterparts, it is possible that NP could also manifest in interactions involving first-generation leptons. Furthermore, recent results from Belle-II reveal a $2.2\sigma$ deviation in $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu})$ from the SM prediction, providing further avenues to explore NP in $b\, \to\, s\, \ell\, \bar{\ell}$ transitions. Motivated by these observations, we perform a global analysis of dimension-6 SMEFT operators, considering the possibility of NP contributions not only in $b\, \to\, s\, \mu\, \bar{\mu}$ transitions but also in $b\, \to\, s\, e\, \bar{e}$ transitions.</description>

      <title>Determination of the $K^+\bar{K}^0$ scattering length and effective range from the $D^+\to\bar{K}^0\pi^+\eta$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering parameters of the \(K^+\bar{K}^0\) system through the analysis of the \(D^+\to\bar{K}^0\pi^+\eta\) reaction, aiming at determining the scattering length \(a\) and effective range \(r_0\) of the \(K^+\bar{K}^0\) interaction. These parameters are extracted by analyzing and fitting the mass distributions of the pairs in the final \(\bar{K}^0\pi^+\eta\) state. To ensure the reliability of the results, we apply resampling techniques to evaluate statistical uncertainties and improve the precision of the scattering parameters. The obtained results are compared with previous theoretical predictions and experimental data, providing new insights into the \(K^+\bar{K}^0\) interaction at low energies.</description>

      <title>SU(3) analysis of nonfactorizable contributions to bottom mesons decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the extension of our previous work [arXiv:2108.03296] entitled Searching a systematics for nonfactorizable contributions to B hadronic decays. In order to realize the full impact of isospin analysis, and to relate decays of strange bottom meson with those of nonstrange bottom mesons, we generalize it to the SU(3) flavor symmetry to investigate the nonfactorizable contributions to CKM-enhanced and CKM-suppressed decays. We start with expressing total weak decay amplitude as sum of the factorizable and nonfactorizable parts, then obtain the factorizable part of the decay amplitude numerically using the known meson decay constants and relevant form-factors, then express the nonfactorizable parts in terms of SU(3)-reduced matrix elements. Using measured branching fractions of a few CKM-favored modes, we fix the reduced matrix elements, and predict branching ratios of the remaining CKM-favored decays and all CKM-suppressed B to PP decays processes.We find that the measured branching fractions agree well with our results, and other predicted values may be tested in the future experiments.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of density perturbation and gravitational wave production from cosmological first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted three-dimensional lattice simulations to study the density perturbation and generation of gravitational waves (GWs) through first-order phase transition (FOPTs). Our findings reveal that for the case of $\beta/H = 6$, density perturbations successfully collapse into PBHs. Moreover, smaller values of $\beta/H$ are more conducive to PBH formation, while the strength of the phase transition $\alpha$ has a relatively minor impact on PBH production. We find that for $\alpha &gt; 1$, the dominant contribution to the density perturbation comes from the delay of vacuum decay, whereas for $\alpha &lt; 1$, the bubble walls' moving forward behavior becomes the primary source. Additionally, the power spectrum of density perturbations generated by the phase transition exhibits a slope of $k^3$ at small wavenumbers and $k^{-1.5}$ at large wavenumbers. Furthermore, we calculated the GW power spectra, and the simulation results show a slope of $k^3$ at small wavenumbers and $k^{-2}$ at large wavenumbers. Our numerical simulations confirm that slow PTs can produce PBHs and provide predictions for the GW power spectrum, offering crucial theoretical support for GW detection.</description>

      <title>Excluding Stable Quark Matter: Insights from the QCD Vacuum Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark matter (or quark nuggets), composed of quarks in the QCD deconfined and chiral-symmetry restored phase, has been conjectured to exist in nature for over half a century. With zero external pressure, it is stabilized by the balance between the quark Fermi pressure and the QCD vacuum pressure. Whether quark matter is more stable than ordinary nuclei has been a long-standing question, which requires understanding of the QCD vacuum energy. In this work, we employ both theoretical and data-driven methods to derive the QCD vacuum energy, utilizing the GMOR relation, the low-energy theorem, the equation of state from Lattice QCD, and the instanton gas/liquid model. The QCD vacuum energy is determined to be between $(163\,\mbox{MeV})^4$ and $(190\,\mbox{MeV})^4$. Alongside the quark matter pressure calculated from perturbative QCD calculations, both the 2-flavor (via Bodmer) and 2+1-flavor (via Witten) quark matter are found to be more than 100 MeV per baryon heavier than the nucleons. Therefore, we exclude the possibility of quark matter being a more stable state than ordinary nuclei.</description>

      <title>Generative adversarial neural networks for simulating neutrino interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. The models produce scattering events for a given neutrino energy. GAN models are trained on simulation data from NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating only quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics. It is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the event distributions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings via Electroweak Production of $\gamma\gamma jj$ at Future Proton-Proton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of quartic gauge couplings provides a crucial test of the Standard Model and serves as a potential window into new physics at higher energy scales. Within the framework of Effective Field Theory, deviations from the SM can be parameterized through dimension-8 operators. In this study, we analyze the process $pp \rightarrow \gamma\gamma jj$ at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and the Future Circular Collider in hadron mode (FCC-hh) to probe the sensitivity to anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGCs), particularly $f_{T8}/\Lambda^4$ and $f_{T9}/\Lambda^4$. Monte Carlo simulations of signal and relevent backgrouds are performed using MadGraph for event generation, Pythia for parton showering and hadronization, and Delphes for detector simulation. A multivariate analysis based on Boosted Decision Trees is employed to optimize the signal-to-background discrimination, incorporating a comprehensive set of kinematic and reconstructed variables of the final state particles. Additionally, we evaluate unitarity-violating effects associated with dimension-8 operators by imposing energy cutoffs on the di-photon invariant mass. The expected exclusion and discovery significances are computed, accounting for systematic uncertainties to ensure a realistic assessment of collider reach. Our findings indicate that the FCC-hh offers significantly improved sensitivity compared to the HL-LHC and current experimental results by ATLAS, reinforcing its potential for probing aQGCs. Notably, even under a 10\% systematic uncertainty, our projected limits for FCC-hh at 95\% confidence level surpass the current best constraints reported by the ATLAS collaboration, highlighting the enhanced discovery prospects at future high-energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Search for CP Violations in the Production and Decay of the Hyperon-Antihyperon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel joint angular distribution analysis for the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to J/\psi\to B(\to B_1\pi)\bar{B}(\to \bar{B}_1\pi)$, where $B$ and $B_{1}$ are hyperons. We consider both transverse and longitudinal beam polarization and analyze CP violation in the production and decay of hyperons. We present the complete Hessian matrix for the sensitivities of the weak decay parameters $\alpha_{-},~\alpha_{+},~\phi_{\Xi}$ and $\bar{\phi}_{\Xi}$, the P-violating term $F_{A}$, and the EDM $d_{B}$ (derived from the CP-violating term $H_{T}$), under the BESIII and STCF statistics. We find that polarization enhances the sensitivity of the parameters. Specifically, longitudinal polarization provides a more significant improvement compared to transverse polarization, with the enhancement being more pronounced for single-step decays than for multi-step decays. With the expected statistics from the BESIII experiment, the estimated EDM sensitivities for $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^{+}$ are on the order of $10^{-19}~e~\rm cm$, while those for $\Xi^{-}$ and $\Xi^{0}$ are $10^{-18}~e~\rm cm$. Furthermore, the STCF experiment is expected to improve these estimates by $1\sim2$ orders of magnitude. For hyperon decay parameters, a $1\sigma$ measurement of $A_{CP}$ can be achieved at BESIII, while at STCF, $A_{CP}$ can be observed with a significance exceeding $10\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Flavor puzzle in three Higgs-doublet models: Insights from BGL and lessons from flavor data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the 3HDM, referred to as the BGL-3HDM, incorporating a $U(1)_1\times U(1)_2$ symmetry, which can distinguish the primary sources of mass for different fermion generations. In the version considered here, the Yukawa matrices in the down-quark and charged lepton sectors are diagonal, thereby eliminating tree-level FCNCs in these sectors. FCNC interactions mediated by neutral nonstandard Higgses are confined to the up-quark sector only. No new BSM parameters are introduced by the Yukawa sector of the model, making it as economical as the NFC versions of 3HDM with a $U(1)_1\times U(1)_2$ symmetry in terms of the number of free parameters. However, even in the down-quark and in the charged lepton sectors, flavor diagonal but nonuniversal Higgs couplings set this model apart from the NFC versions of the 3HDM.</description>

      <title>Long-range interactions in double heavy tetraquarks $\bar Q \bar Q qq$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the large distances compared to the chiral symmetry breaking scale, a four-quark system $\bar Q \bar Q qq$ (with $Q$ as heavy and $q$ as light quarks) can be treated as two asymptotic mesons interacting via strong residual forces. The static heavy quark assumption enables using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where one can compute the potential between two heavy antiquarks in the presence of two light quarks of finite mass -- a prescription utilized in several lattice QCD studies. To analyse the long-range strong force in a $\bar Q \bar Q qq$ system, we study the interaction between two bottom mesons in the heavy quark limit using chiral effective field theory and dispersion theory with unphysical pion mass. We present methods to obtain two-pion-exchange potential between two static heavy mesons at non-physical pion mass and compare our preliminary results with the corresponding lattice QCD potentials.</description>

      <title>Next to Soft Threshold Resummation for $VH$ Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the threshold effects for the associated production of a Higgs boson with a massive vector boson $(V=Z,W)$ in the $q\bar{q} \rightarrow V^\star \rightarrow VH$ process at the LHC. By leveraging the universality of threshold logarithms and employing soft-virtual (SV) and next-to-soft virtual (NSV) resummation techniques, we compute threshold corrections to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. After matching the resummed predictions to the Next-to-Next-to-Leading order (NNLO) fixed order results, we present the invariant mass distribution to NNLO$+\overline{\text{NNLL}}$ accuracy in QCD for the current LHC energies and the total production cross sections. The $VH$ production channel is crucial for studying the couplings of the Higgs boson to the vector bosons $(W,Z)$ and understanding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. Precision measurements of this process help test the validity of the standard model (SM) and can reveal potential deviations indicating new physics.</description>

Abstract: We consider the rotational Brownian motion of heavy quark in QCD medium and provide predictions for polarization of open heavy-flavor hadrons. We calculate expressions for vector and tensor polarization, corresponding to baryon spin polarization and meson spin alignment, respectively. We propose that the transverse momentum dependence of heavy quark polarization may serve as a distinctive signature of the intense initial magnetic field generated in off-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the Higgs sector from Reduction of Couplings in the Type-II 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of reduction of couplings provides a systematic procedure to search for relations among seemingly unrelated parameters of a renormalizable theory. As a consequence, such reduced theories exhibit more constrained parameter spaces. Motivated by this, in this work we perform a precise phenomenological analysis of the Higgs sector of a version of the Type-II 2HDM on which the idea of reduction of couplings has been applied. We compute Higgs boson masses and decay widths and confront them with current experimental measurements. Compared to the previous study, apart from the inclusion of actual experimental constraints on production and decay rates of Higgs bosons, we also include all model parameters in the RGE running as well as one- and two-loop threshold corrections and two-loop RGE running from the high scale. Furthermore, Higgs boson masses are now computed at the one-loop level. Top quark mass, which is an important prediction of the reduction framework, is now evaluated including previously missing sub-leading one-loop contributions, with an addition of up to four-loop pure-QCD corrections.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Non-Locality in Particle Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of entanglement and Bell non-locality among multi-particle quantum systems offers a profound avenue for testing and understanding the limits of quantum mechanics and local real hidden variable theories. In this work, we examine non-local correlations among three massless spin-1/2 particles generated from the three-body decay of a massive particle, utilizing a framework based on general four-fermion interactions. By analyzing several inequalities, we address the detection of deviations from quantum mechanics as well as violations of two key hidden variable theories: fully local-real and bipartite local-real theories. Our approach encompasses the standard Mermin inequality and the tight $4 \times 4 \times 2$ inequality introduced by Laskowski et al., providing a comprehensive framework for probing three-partite non-local correlations. Our findings provide deeper insights into the boundaries of classical and quantum theories in three-particle systems, advancing the understanding of non-locality in particle decays and its relevance to particle physics and quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Emission and Plasma Heating from Primordial Black Holes: An Improved Approach to $N_\mathrm{eff}$ Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of neutrino emission via Hawking radiation from primordial black holes (PBHs) on the cosmological effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, after neutrino decoupling. By comparing this effect with observational limits, we derive bounds on the abundance of light PBHs. Our analysis incorporates two previously unaccounted-for effects: the emission of secondary neutrinos from unstable particles, which increases $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and the modification of the neutrino-photon temperature ratio due to particle emission heating the photon plasma, which lowers $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Overall, including these effects allows us to impose constraints on PBH masses with initial masses in the range $10^9~{\rm g}\lesssim M_{\rm ini} \lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$. However, our limits remain less stringent than those derived from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Structure of center vortex matter in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of center vortices is studied in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory for the first time to illuminate the interplay between elementary (center charge $\pm 1$) and doubly charged vortices. Unlike in SU(3), where charge $+2$ vortices are simply elementary vortices with reversed orientations in spacetime, these possibilities are physically distinct in SU(4). Visualizations of the vortex structure in three-dimensional slices reveal the various ways in which doubly charged objects manifest, as the convergence and matching of elementary vortices or as isolated doubly charged loops. An algorithm is described to classify every doubly charged chain as one of these three types. A collection of vortex statistics is considered to quantify the vortex structure. Many of these pertain to the novel doubly charged objects, including their relative proportions and chain lengths, which are analyzed to highlight the differences between each chain type. Three different lattice spacings are employed to investigate the approach to the continuum limit. Vortex matching chains are found to be shorter on average but also more prevalent than vortex convergences, ascribed to their interpretation as extended center monopoles. In addition, the lengths of both vortex convergences and vortex matchings are observed to follow an exponential distribution, allowing the introduction of a constant probability for a doubly charged chain to split into two elementary vortices as it propagates. Combined, these findings provide a characterization of the vortices that comprise center vortex structures in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>The Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule, i.e. the lowest odd moment of the parity-violating structure function, $F_3$, of the nucleon from a lattice QCD calculation of the Compton amplitude. Our calculations are performed on $48^3 \times 96$ lattices at the $SU(3)$ symmetric point for two lattice spacings. We extract the moments for several values of the current momenta in the range $0.5 \lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 10 \; {\rm GeV}^2$, covering both the nonperturbative and perturbative regimes. We compare our moments to the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule and discuss the implications for higher-twist effects, a determination of $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ from a hadronic quantity complementing the phenomenological and other lattice approaches, and electroweak box contributions crucial for CKM unitarity studies.</description>

      <title>Progress on lattice study of the chimera baryon spectrum in Sp(4) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigation of composite Higgs
  models (CHMs) is of importance in contemporary particle physics. In this
  article, we present lattice computations of the chimera baryon masses in $Sp(4)$
  gauge theory with two and three Dirac flavours of hyperquarks (beyond the Standard Model fermions coupled to the $Sp(4)$ gauge fields) in the
  fundamental and antisymmetric representations, respectively.
  The chimera baryons are crucial for generating the Standard Model
  fermion masses through the partial compositeness mechanism in this
  gauge theory that can serve as the ultraviolet completion of the CHM with pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons in the coset $SU(4)/Sp(4)$.
  Results shown here are primarily from a completed quenched computation, while
  those from our ongoing work with dynamical
  simulations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Color-magnetic correlations in SU(N) lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in QCD, we investigate field-strength correlations in both SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD.In the Euclidean Landau gauge, we numerically calculate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \perp)) \rangle$ with $\perp \equiv x, y$, and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \parallel) \rangle$ with $\parallel~\equiv z, t$. In the Landau gauge, all two-point field-strength correlations $\langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$ are described by these two quantities, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same-point correlation. The parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to an approximate cancellation for the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \sim 0$. Next, we decompose the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$. The quadratic term is always negative, which is explained by the Yukawa-type gluon propagator $\langle A_\mu(s)A_\mu(s')\rangle \propto e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ in the Landau gauge. The quartic term gives a relatively small contribution. In the infrared region, the cubic term is positive and tends to cancel with the quadratic term, resulting in a small value of $C_{\perp}(r)$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on New Physics with Light Mediators and Generalized Neutrino Interactions via Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate new physics effects on the framework of Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) from Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) of neutrinos and generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) as well as the possibility of light mediators from simplified model which includes all possible Lorentz-invariant interactions of vector (V), axialvector (A), scalar (S), pseudoscalar (P), and tensor (T) type. The constraints and the allowed regions at $90\%$ C.L. for masses and couplings in each new physics scenario are derived from the analysis of TEXONO data, including two datasets from 2016 with a high purity $n$-type point-contact (nPC) germanium (Ge) detector and from 2024 with an advanced $p$-type point-contact (pPC) Ge detector. The results are presented in comparison with the current data of COHERENT with CsI and LAr detectors to highlight the complementarity of reactor- and accelerator-based neutrino experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate for the first time the $\eta^\prime p$ femtoscopic correlation function to study the $\eta^\prime N$ interaction. We find it extremely sensitive to the value of the $\eta^\prime p$ scattering length, for which at present there exists only very limited information, not even knowing its sign. The measurement of this correlation function would provide much valuable information on the $\eta^\prime N$ interaction, which could then also be used to settle the issue of possible $\eta^\prime$ nucleus bound states, an issue attracting much attention in the nuclear physics community.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star (NS) observables and the underlying EoS parameters using symbolic regression method. These EoS models, derived from a mix of agnostic and physics-based approaches, considered neutron stars composed of nucleons, hyperons, and other exotic degrees of freedom in beta equilibrium. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV.fm$^{-3}$. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$. These insights offer a promising and efficient framework to decode the dense matter EoS directly from the accurate knowledge of NS observables.</description>

      <title>Event Generators for High-Energy Physics Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11110v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the status of Monte-Carlo event generators for high-energy particle physics. Guided by the experimental needs and requirements, we highlight areas of active development, and opportunities for future improvements. Particular emphasis is given to physics models and algorithms that are employed across a variety of experiments. These common themes in event generator development lead to a more comprehensive understanding of physics at the highest energies and intensities, and allow models to be tested against a wealth of data that have been accumulated over the past decades. A cohesive approach to event generator development will allow these models to be further improved and systematic uncertainties to be reduced, directly contributing to future experimental success. Event generators are part of a much larger ecosystem of computational tools. They typically involve a number of unknown model parameters that must be tuned to experimental data, while maintaining the integrity of the underlying physics models. Making both these data, and the analyses with which they have been obtained accessible to future users is an essential aspect of open science and data preservation. It ensures the consistency of physics models across a variety of experiments.</description>

      <title>Two dark matter candidates in a doublet-triplet Higgs model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Standard Model extension that provides a bicomponent dark matter scenario as well as a mechanism for the generation of left-handed neutrino masses. We extend the Standard Model scalar sector by adding an inert $SU(2)_L$ doublet with hypercharge $Y= 1/2$ and a triplet with hypercharge $Y=0$. These scalars provide dark matter candidates in two dark sectors stabilised by discrete symmetries.
  We consider the contribution of both candidates to the total relic abundance in order to recover the desert regions in their standard alone cases. In addition, we add an active scalar $SU(2)_L$ triplet with hypercharge $Y=1$ in order to generate light neutrino masses. We analyse the results of dark matter phenomenology for the model and the neutrino mass generation through the type-II seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Hadronization of Heavy Quarks</title>

Abstract: Heavy-flavor hadrons produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions are a sensitive probe for studying hadronization mechanisms of the quark-gluon-plasma. In this work, we survey how different transport models for the simulation of heavy-quark diffusion through a quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions implement hadronization and how this affects final-state observables. Utilizing the same input charm-quark distribution in all models at the hadronization transition, we find that the transverse-momentum dependence of the nuclear modification factor of various charm hadron species has significant sensitivity to the hadronization scheme. In addition, the charm-hadron elliptic flow exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the elliptic flow of the hadronizing partonic medium.</description>

      <title>Global coupled-channel analysis of $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ processes in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high-precision $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ data from the BESIII and Belle are highly useful to understand vector charmonium ($\psi$) pole structures and puzzling lineshapes due to the exotic hadron candidates $Y$. We thus perform a global coupled-channel analysis of most of the available data (10 two-body, 9 three-body, and 1 four-body final states) in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV. Not only cross sections but also invariant mass distributions of subsystems are fitted. Our model includes dozens of (quasi) two-body states that nonperturbatively couple with each other through bare $\psi$ excitations, particle-exchange, and short-range mechanisms; approximate three-body unitarity is considered. The amplitudes obtained from the fit are analytically continued to $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles. We find $\psi$ states similar to those in the Particle Data Group listing and $Y(4320)$. Moreover, several $\psi$ states, including new ones, are found close to open charm thresholds. Two $Z_c$ poles are found as virtual states $\sim 40$ MeV below the $D^*\bar{D}^{(*)}$ thresholds, being consistent with lattice QCD results. This work presents the first global analysis to determine $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles, thereby paving the way to extracting detailed properties of the prominent exotic hadron candidates from data.</description>

      <title>Radiative decays of $P$-wave bottom baryons from light-cone sum rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a comprehensive investigation on the radiative decays of $P$-wave bottom baryons using the light-cone sum rule method. We analyze their electromagnetic transitions into ground-state bottom baryons together with a photon. Together with their mass spectra and strong decays investigated in Refs. \cite{Yang:2020zrh,Tan:2023opd}, a rather complete QCD sum rule study has been done to understand the $P$-wave singly bottom baryons within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. As summarized in Tables~\ref{tab:candidate}/\ref{tab:candidate6f}, some $P$-wave bottom baryons have limited strong decay widths so that their radiative decay widths become non-negligible. We propose to study these excited bottom baryons and their radiative decays in the future Belle-II, BESIII, and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>Improved constraints on Higgs boson self-couplings with quartic and cubic power dependencies of the cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise determination of the Higgs boson self-couplings is essential for understanding the mechanism underlying electroweak symmetry breaking. However, owing to the limited number of Higgs boson pair events at the LHC, only loose constraints have been established to date. Current constraints are based on the assumption that the cross section is a quadratic function of the trilinear Higgs self-coupling within the $\kappa$ framework. Incorporating higher-order quantum corrections from virtual Higgs bosons would significantly alter this functional form, introducing new quartic and cubic power dependencies on the trilinear Higgs self-coupling. To derive this new functional form, we propose a specialized renormalization procedure that tracks all Higgs self-couplings at each calculation step. Additionally, we introduce renormalization constants for coupling modifiers within the $\kappa$ framework to ensure the cancellation of all ultraviolet divergences. With new functional forms of the cross sections in both the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion channels, the upper limit of $\kappa_{\lambda_{\rm 3H}}=\lambda_{\rm 3H}/\lambda_{\rm 3H}^{\rm SM}$ set by the ATLAS (CMS) collaboration is reduced from 6.6 (6.49) to 5.4 (5.37). However, extracting a meaningful constraint on the quartic Higgs self-coupling $\lambda_{\rm 4H}$ from Higgs boson pair production data remains challenging. We also present the invariant mass distributions of the Higgs boson pair at different values of $\kappa_{\lambda}$, which could assist in setting optimal cuts for experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic responses of a non-extensive quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the non-extensive statistical mechanics and the gluon polarization tensor obtained from kinetic theory, we derive the longitudinal and transverse gluon self-energies for the quark-gluon plasma. The electric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and the magnetic permeability $\mu_M$ are evaluated from the gluon self-energies through which the real part of the square of the refraction index ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and the Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ are investigated. The real part of $\varepsilon$ displays a frequency pole $\omega_d=p$, which is just the position of the frequency inflexion of the imaginary part of $\varepsilon$. The non-extensive parameter $q$ significantly affects the real and imaginary parts of $\varepsilon$ in the space-like region $\omega&lt;p$, while the frequency pole $\omega_d=p$ remains unchanged as $q$ increases. The magnetic permeability, ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and the Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ diverge at frequency $\omega_m$. As $q$ increases, the pole frequency $\omega_m$ shifts to large frequency region. The Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ becomes negative in a quite large frequency region $\omega\in[\omega_c, \omega_m]$. When $q$ increases, the frequency range for $n_{DL}&lt;0$ becomes wider. Nevertheless, there are no propagating modes for the negative refraction. In addition, as momentum $p$ increases, the electric permittivity, the magnetic permeability, ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and $n_{DL}$ are sensitive to the change of $p$, which indicates the importance of the spatial dispersion in the electromagnetic responses of the QGP.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Selection Bias in Inclusive Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first-ever measurement of energy correlators within inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions, revealed by the CMS Collaboration, shows a clear enhancement at large angles relative to the proton-proton (p-p) baseline. However, interpreting this enhancement is complicated due to selection bias from energy loss, which also distorts the energy correlator heavy-ion to p-p ratio in the hadronization region, hindering our understanding of parton/hadron dynamics in a colored medium. In this Letter, we introduce a new ratio of energy correlator observables that removes the leading effects of selection bias from the two-point energy correlator spectrum (E2C). Pythia and Herwig simulations show that the impact of selection bias in the E2C is reduced by an order of magnitude, while sensitivity to any other medium modifications is retained. This quantity can be obtained directly from the experimental measurements presented by CMS, as illustrated in the accompanying note.</description>

      <title>FIMP Dark Matter in bulk viscous non-standard cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the extension of the classical non-standard cosmological model in which dissipative processes are considered through a bulk viscous term in the new field $\phi$, which interacts with the radiation component during the early universe. Specifically, we consider an interaction term of the form $\Gamma_{\phi} \rho_{\phi}$, where $\Gamma_{\phi}$ represents the decay rate of the field and $\rho_{\phi}$ denotes its energy density and a bulk viscosity described by $\xi=\xi_{0}\rho_{\phi}^{1/2}$, within the framework of Eckart's theory. This extended non-standard cosmology is employed to explore the parameter space for the production of Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (FIMPs) as Dark Matter candidates, assuming a constant thermal averaged Dark Matter production cross-section ($\langle\sigma v\rangle$), as well as a preliminary analysis of the non-constant case. In particular, for certain combinations of the model and Dark Matter parameters, namely ($T_\text{end}$,$\kappa$) and $(m_\chi,\langle\sigma v\rangle)$, where $T_\text{end}$ corresponds to the temperature at which $\phi$ decays, $\kappa$ is the ratio between the initial energy density of $\phi$ and radiation, and $m_\chi$ is the Dark Matter mass, we identify extensive new parameter regions where Dark Matter can be successfully established while reproducing the currently observed relic density, in contrast to the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM and classical non-standard cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Subtraction of the $t\bar{t}$ contribution in $tW\bar{b}$ production at the one-loop level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $tW\bar{b}$ production contributes to the real corrections to the $tW$ cross section. It would interfere with the top quark pair production, causing difficulties in a clear definition of the $tW{\bar b}$ events. The subtraction of the $t\bar{t}$ contributions has been performed in the diagram removal or diagram subtraction schemes for the tree-level processes. However, these schemes rely on the ability to identify the double resonant diagrams and thus can not be extended to loop diagrams. We propose a new scheme to subtract the $t\bar{t}$ contributions by power expansion of the squared amplitude in the resonant region. In order to cancel the infra-red divergences of the loop amplitudes, a widely used method is to introduce the dipole counter-terms, an ingredient in calculations of the full next-to-leading order QCD corrections. In our scheme, these counter-terms are also power-expanded. As a proof of principle, we calculate the one-loop correction to the $d\bar{d}\to \bar{b}Wt$ process, and present the invariant mass distribution of the $W\bar{b}$ system.</description>

      <title>A 95 GeV Higgs Boson in the $U(1)_X$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CMS and ATLAS Collaborations have recently reported their findings based on the comprehensive run 2 dataset, detailing their searches for a light Higgs boson with a mass of approximately 95 GeV. We investigate the excesses observed in the $\gamma\gamma$, $\tau{\bar\tau}$ and $b{\bar b}$ data at approximately 95 GeV in the $U(1)_X$ model. Additionally, it also mixes with the SM-like Higgs boson. Research indicates that, in this model, identifying this singlet Higgs state as the lightest Higgs boson holds tremendous potential for explaining the excess observed at approximately 95 GeV. In our calculations, we maintain the masses of the lightest and next-to-lightest Higgs bosons at approximately 95 GeV and 125 GeV, respectively. The study finds that the theoretical predictions for the signal strengths $\mu(h_{95})_{\gamma\gamma}$ $\mu(h_{95})_{\tau{\bar\tau}}$ and $\mu(h_{95})_{b{\bar b}}$ in the $U(1)_X$ model align well with the excesses observed by CMS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the intriguing phenomenon of beta decay of a free neutron in a non-plane-wave(structured) state. Our analysis covers three types of states: unpolarized vortex (Bessel) neutrons that possess nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets, and spin-correlated OAM (spin-orbit) states characterized by unique polarization patterns. These states are of particular interest as they have recently been generated in neutron optics experiments and have promising applications in studies of quantum magnetic materials. The spectral-angular distributions (SAD) of the emitted electrons and protons are examined. We show that the high sensitivity of the protons SAD to the structure of the neutron wave packet can be used as a tool to extract the distinctive features of the non-plane-wave neutron states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the angular distribution of the emitted particles serves as a reflection of the spatial symmetries inherent to the neutron wave packet.</description>

Abstract: We study neutrino oscillations in background matter within the quantum field theory formalism where neutrino mass eigenstates are virtual particles. In this case, neutrino mass eigenstates are mixed owing to the interaction with matter. Assuming that neutrinos are Majorana particles, we find the exact propagators for massive neutrinos accounting for the interaction with matter by solving the analog of the Dyson equation. These propagators are used to calculate the transition probability which coincides with the prediction of the standard quantum mechanical treatment of neutrino flavor oscillations in uniform matter. Finally, we analyze the approximations made in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Revisiting light-flavor diquarks in the inverse matrix method of QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reexamines the spectroscopic parameters of light-flavor diquarks within the framework of quantum chromodynamics sum rules (QCDSR) using the inverse matrix method. Conventional QCDSR analyses are based on assumptions such as quark-hadron duality and continuum models, which introduce a degree of systematic uncertainty. The inverse matrix method circumvents these assumptions by reformulating the problem as an inverse integral equation and expanding the unknown spectral density using orthogonal Laguerre polynomials. This method allows for a direct determination of spectral densities, thereby enhancing the precision of predictions regarding resonance masses and decay constants. By employing this methodology with regard to light-flavor diquarks ($sq$ and $ud$), it is possible to extract the associated masses and decay constants. The results indicate that the masses of diquarks with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^+$ and $J^P = 0^-$ are nearly degenerate. We compare our results regarding masses and decay constants with those of other theoretical predictions, which could prove a useful complementary tool in interpretation. Our results are consistent with those in the literature and can be shown as evidence for the consistency of the method. The results achieved in this study highlight the potential of the inverse matrix method as a robust tool for exploring nonperturbative QCD phenomena and elucidating the internal structure of exotic hadronic systems.</description>

      <title>Isolating Unisolated Upsilons with Anomaly Detection in CMS Open Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first study of anti-isolated Upsilon decays to two muons ($\Upsilon \to \mu^+ \mu^-$) in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Using a machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection strategy, we "rediscover" the $\Upsilon$ in 13 TeV CMS Open Data from 2016, despite overwhelming anti-isolated backgrounds. We elevate the signal significance to $6.4 \sigma$ using these methods, starting from $1.6 \sigma$ using the dimuon mass spectrum alone. Moreover, we demonstrate improved sensitivity from using an ML-based estimate of the multi-feature likelihood compared to traditional "cut-and-count" methods. Our work demonstrates that it is possible and practical to find real signals in experimental collider data using ML-based anomaly detection, and we distill a readily-accessible benchmark dataset from the CMS Open Data to facilitate future anomaly detection developments.</description>

      <title>Imprints of an early matter-dominated era arising from dark matter dilution mechanism on cosmic string dynamics and gravitational wave signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of an early matter-dominated era in cosmic history on the dynamics of cosmic strings and the resulting stochastic gravitational waves. Specifically, we examine the case where this era originates from the dark matter dilution mechanism within the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model. By numerically solving the Boltzmann equations governing the energy densities of the relevant components, we meticulously analyze the modifications to the cosmological scale factor, the number density of cosmic string loops, and the gravitational wave spectrum. Our results reveal that the early matter-dominated era causes a characteristic suppression in the high-frequency regime of the gravitational wave spectrum, providing distinct and testable signatures for future ground-based interferometer experiments.</description>

      <title>The origin and evolution of the normal Type Ia SN 2018aoz with infant-phase reddening and excess emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN~2018aoz is a Type Ia SN with a $B$-band plateau and excess emission in the infant-phase light curves $\lesssim$ 1 day after first light, evidencing an over-density of surface iron-peak elements as shown in our previous study. Here, we advance the constraints on the nature and origin of SN~2018aoz based on its evolution until the nebular phase. Near-peak spectroscopic features show the SN is intermediate between two subtypes of normal Type Ia: Core-Normal and Broad-Line. The excess emission could have contributions from the radioactive decay of surface iron-peak elements as well as ejecta interaction with either the binary companion or a small torus of circumstellar material. Nebular-phase limits on H$\alpha$ and He~I favour a white dwarf companion, consistent with the small companion size constrained by the low early SN luminosity, while the absence of [O~I] and He~I disfavours a violent merger of the progenitor. Of the two main explosion mechanisms proposed to explain the distribution of surface iron-peak elements in SN~2018aoz, the asymmetric Chandrasekhar-mass explosion is less consistent with the progenitor constraints and the observed blueshifts of nebular-phase [Fe~II] and [Ni~II]. The helium-shell double-detonation explosion is compatible with the observed lack of C spectral features, but current 1-D models are incompatible with the infant-phase excess emission, $B_{\rm max}-V_{\rm max}$ color, and absence of nebular-phase [Ca~II]. Although the explosion processes of SN~2018aoz still need to be more precisely understood, the same processes could produce a significant fraction of Type Ia SNe that appear normal after $\sim$ 1 day.</description>

      <title>Effect of interparticle fields and radiation reaction on beam dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of relativistic particles in an intense electromagnetic field can be described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, where radiation reaction (RR) is accounted for via a self-force, and interparticle fields are often neglected as an approximation. However, the inclusion of interparticle fields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, particularly during coherent emission. Here, we present: (i) an analytical proof showing that the energy-momentum conservation law of the Hamilton-Rohrlich-Dirac action, which is divergence-free and describes a generic system of interacting charges, respects causality and provides physically sensible results; (ii) a simple generalization of the LL equation for many particles evaluated as a function of the total field, i.e., the sum of the external and interparticle fields. By performing first-principles numerical simulations of a neutral, relativistic bunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, this theory is shown to satisfy energy-momentum conservation when interparticle fields and RR are simultaneously taken into account; and (iii) the combined effect of interparticle fields and RR primarily affects the tail of the particle energy distribution. Additionally, our first-principles simulations show that the effect of interparticle fields on beam energy loss becomes smaller when most of the radiated energy is incoherent.</description>

      <title>Trans-series from condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules provide a method to obtain trans-series expansions in many quantum field theories, in which exponentially small corrections are calculated by combining the operator product expansion with the assumption of vacuum condensates. In some solvable models, exact expressions for trans-series can be obtained from non-perturbative results, and this makes it possible to test the SVZ method by comparing its predictions to these exact trans-series. In this paper we perform such a precision test in the example of the fermion self-energy in the Gross-Neveu model. Its exact trans-series expansion can be extracted from the large $N$ solution, at the first non-trivial order in $1/N$. It is given by an infinite series of exponentially small corrections involving factorially divergent power series in the 't Hooft parameter. We show that the first two corrections are associated to two-quark and four-quark condensates, and we reproduce the corresponding power series exactly, and at all loops, by using the SVZ method. In addition, the numerical values of the condensates can be extracted from the exact result, up to order $1/N$.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quarks in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic basis with hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying on the fact that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which control the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of charm quark pairs through the rotation of Feynman diagrams such that the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams are exchanged. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Compared with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flow in fixed-target $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne collisions as a probe of quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The System for Measuring Overlap with Gas (SMOG2) at the LHCb detector enables the study of fixed-target ion-ion collisions at relativistic energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\sim100$ GeV in the centre-of-mass). With input from \textit{ab initio} calculations of the structure of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne, we compute 3+1D hydrodynamic predictions for the anisotropic flow of Pb+Ne and Pb+O collisions, to be tested with upcoming LHCb data. This will allow the detailed study of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation as well as experimental tests of the predicted nuclear shapes. Elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Pb+Ne collisions is greatly enhanced compared to the Pb+O baseline due to the shape of $^{20}$Ne, which is deformed in a bowling-pin geometry. Owing to the large $^{208}$Pb radius, this effect is seen in a broad centrality range, a unique feature of this collision configuration. Larger elliptic flow further enhances the quadrangular flow ($v_4$) of Pb+Ne collisions via non-linear coupling, and impacts the sign of the kurtosis of the elliptic flow vector distribution ($c_2\{4\}$). Exploiting the shape of $^{20}$Ne proves thus an ideal method to investigate the formation of QGP in fixed-target experiments at LHCb, and demonstrates the power of SMOG2 as a tool to image nuclear ground states.</description>

      <title>Calculating Bayesian evidence for inflationary models using CONNECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian evidence is a standard tool used for comparing the ability of different models to fit available data and is used extensively in cosmology. However, since the evidence calculation involves performing an integral of the likelihood function over the entire space of model parameters this can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both CPU and time consumption. For example, in the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model and using CMB data from the Planck satellite, the dimensionality of the model space is over 30 (typically 6 cosmological parameters and 28 nuisance parameters). Even the simplest possible model requires $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ calls to an Einstein--Boltzmann solver such as CLASS or CAMB and takes several days.
  Here we present calculations of Bayesian evidence using the CONNECT framework to calculate cosmological observables. We demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to those obtained using Einstein--Boltzmann solvers, but at a minute fraction of the computational cost. As a test case, we then go on to compute Bayesian evidence ratios for a selection of slow-roll inflationary models.
  In the setup presented here, the total computation time is completely dominated by the likelihood function calculation which now becomes the main bottleneck for increasing computation speed.</description>

      <title>Implications of DES 5YR SNe Dataset for $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy (DE) deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model.Here we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing primarily frequentist profile likelihoods, supported by complementary Bayesian methods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES data up to a point that there is a $2.5 \sigma$ discrepancy with Planck. We relax the traditional $\Omega_m \leq 1$ prior to demonstrate negative DE densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$ at the highest effective redshift probed. Nevertheless, the largest discrepancy with Planck occurs for profile likelihoods and posteriors peaked at $\Omega_m &lt; 1$ in the traditional $\Lambda$CDM regime. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

      <title>Instability of nonsingular black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that nonsingular black holes realized in nonlinear electrodynamics are always prone to Laplacian instability around the center because of a negative squared sound speed in the angular direction. This is the case for both electric and magnetic BHs, where the instability of one of the vector-field perturbations leads to enhancing a dynamical gravitational perturbation in the even-parity sector. Thus, the background regular metric is no longer maintained in a steady state. Our results suggest that the construction of stable, nonsingular black holes with regular centers, if they exist, requires theories beyond nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to compute real-time path integrals numerically, by Monte-Carlo sampling on near-Lefschetz thimbles. We present a collection of tools based on the Lefschetz thimble methods, which together provide an alternative to existing methods such as the Generalised thimble. These involve a convenient coordinate parameterization of the thimble, direct numerical integration along a radial coordinate into an effective path integral weight and locally deforming the Lefschetz thimble using its Gaussian (non-interacting theory) counterpart in a region about the critical point. We apply this to quantum mechanics, identify possible pitfalls and benefits, and benchmark its efficiency.</description>

      <title>The hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon $g-2$ at long distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our lattice QCD result for the long-distance part of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution, $(a_\mu^{\rm hvp})^{\rm LD}$, to the muon $g-2$ in the time-momentum representation. This is the numerically dominant, and at the same time the most challenging part regarding statistical precision. Our calculation is based on ensembles with dynamical up, down and strange quarks, employing the O($a$)-improved Wilson fermion action with lattice spacings ranging from $0.035-0.099$ fm. In order to reduce statistical noise in the long-distance part of the correlator to the per-mille level, we apply low-mode averaging and combine it with an explicit spectral reconstruction. Our result is $(a_\mu^{\rm hvp})^{\rm LD} = 423.2(4.2)_{\rm stat}(3.4)_{\rm syst}\times 10^{-10}$ in isospin-symmetric QCD, where the pion decay constant is used to set the energy scale. When combined with our previous results for the short- and intermediate-distance window observables and after including all sub-dominant contributions as well as isospin-breaking corrections, we obtain the total leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution as $a_\mu^{\rm hvp} = 724.5(4.9)_{\rm stat}(5.2)_{\rm syst}\times 10^{-10}$. Our result displays a tension of 3.9 standard deviations with the data-driven estimate published in the 2020 White Paper, but leads to a SM prediction for the total muon anomalous magnetic moment that agrees with the current experimental average.</description>

      <title>Clash of the Titans: ultra-high energy KM3NeT event versus IceCube data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: KM3NeT has reported the detection of a remarkably high-energy through-going muon. Lighting up about a third of the detector, this muon likely originated from a neutrino exceeding 10 PeV in energy. The crucial question we need to answer is where this event comes from and what its source is. Intriguingly, IceCube has been operating with a much larger effective area for a considerably longer time, yet it has not reported neutrinos above 10~PeV. We quantify the tension between the KM3NeT event and the absence of similar high-energy events in IceCube. Through a detailed analysis, we determine the most likely neutrino energy to be in the range of 23 - 2400 PeV. We find a $3.5\sigma$ tension between the two experiments, assuming the neutrino is from the diffuse isotropic neutrino flux. Alternatively, assuming the event is of cosmogenic origin and considering three representative models, this tension still falls within 3.1 - 3.6$\sigma$. The least disfavored scenario is a steady or transient point source, though still leading to $2.9\sigma$ and $2.0\sigma$ tensions, respectively. The lack of observation of high-energy events in IceCube seriously challenges the explanation of this event coming from any known diffuse fluxes. Our results indicate the KM3NeT event is likely the first observation of a new astrophysical source.</description>

Abstract: We use lattice QCD calculations of the finite-volume spectra of systems of two and three mesons to determine, for the first time, three-particle scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses. Our results are for combinations of $\pi^+$ and $K^+$, at a lattice spacing $a=0.063\;$fm, and in the isospin-symmetric limit. We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $\pi^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism. Results are compared to chiral perturbation theory and to phenomenological fits to experimental data, finding good agreement.</description>
