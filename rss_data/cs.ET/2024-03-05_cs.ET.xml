      <title>An All-Optical General-Purpose CPU and Optical Computer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy efficiency of electronic digital processors is primarily limited by the energy consumption of electronic communication and interconnects. The industry is almost unanimously pushing towards replacing both long-haul, as well as local chip interconnects, using optics to drastically increase efficiency. In this paper, we explore what comes after the successful migration to optical interconnects, as with this inefficiency solved, the main source of energy consumption will be electronic digital computing, memory and electro-optical conversion. Our approach attempts to address all these issues by introducing efficient all-optical digital computing and memory, which in turn eliminates the need for electro-optical conversions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a scheme to enable general purpose digital data processing in an integrated form and present our photonic integrated circuit (PIC) implementation. For this demonstration we implemented a URISC architecture capable of running any classical piece of software all-optically and present a comprehensive architectural framework for all-optical computing to go beyond.</description>

      <title>Quantum Readiness in Healthcare and Public Health: Building a Quantum Literate Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies, including quantum computing, cryptography, and sensing, among others, are set to revolutionize sectors ranging from materials science to drug discovery. Despite their significant potential, the implications for public health have been largely overlooked, highlighting a critical gap in recognition and preparation. This oversight necessitates immediate action, as public health remains largely unaware of quantum technologies as a tool for advancement. The application of quantum principles to epidemiology and health informatics, termed quantum health epidemiology and quantum health informatics, has the potential to radically transform disease surveillance, prediction, modeling, and analysis of health data. However, there is a notable lack of quantum expertise within the public health workforce and educational pipelines. This gap underscores the urgent need for the development of quantum literacy among public health practitioners, leaders, and students to leverage emerging opportunities while addressing risks and ethical considerations. Innovative teaching methods, such as interactive simulations, games, visual models, and other tailored platforms, offer viable solutions for bridging knowledge gaps without the need for advanced physics or mathematics. However, the opportunity to adapt is fleeting as the quantum era in healthcare looms near. It is imperative that public health urgently focuses on updating its educational approaches, workforce strategies, data governance, and organizational culture to proactively meet the challenges of quantum disruption thereby becoming quantum ready.</description>

      <title>Molecular unfolding formulation with enhanced quantum annealing approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial phase in drug discovery, involving the precise determination of the optimal spatial arrangement between two molecules when they bind. The such analysis, the 3D structure of molecules is a fundamental consideration, involving the manipulation of molecular representations based on their degrees of freedom, including rigid roto-translation and fragment rotations along rotatable bonds, to determine the preferred spatial arrangement when molecules bind to each other. In this paper, quantum annealing based solution to solve Molecular unfolding (MU) problem, a specific phase within molecular docking, is explored and compared with a state-of-the-art classical algorithm named "GeoDock". Molecular unfolding focuses on expanding a molecule to an unfolded state to simplify manipulation within the target cavity and optimize its configuration, typically by maximizing molecular area or internal atom distances. Molecular unfolding problem aims to find the torsional configuration that increases the inter-atomic distance within a molecule, which also increases the molecular area. Quantum annealing approach first encodes the problem into a Higher-order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) equation which is pruned to an arbitrary percentage to improve the time efficiency and to be able to solve the equation using any quantum annealer. The resultant HUBO is then converted to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization equation (QUBO), which is easily embedded on a D-wave annealing Quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Towards Hamiltonian Simulation with Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to Hamiltonian simulation using Decision Diagrams (DDs), which are an exact representation based on exploiting redundancies in representations of quantum states and operations. While the simulation of Hamiltonians has been studied extensively, scaling these simulations to larger or more complex systems is often challenging and may require approximations or new simulation methods altogether. DDs offer such an alternative that has not yet been applied to Hamiltonian simulation. In this work, we investigate the behavior of DDs for this task. To this end, we review the basics of DDs such as their construction and present how the relevant operations for Hamiltonian simulation are implemented in this data structure -- leading to the first DD-based Hamiltonian simulation approach. Based on several series of evaluations and comparisons, we then discuss insights about the performance of this complementary approach. Overall, these studies show that DDs indeed may offer a promising new data structure which, for certain examples, can provide orders of magnitudes of improvement compared to the state-of-the-art, yet also comes with its own, fundamentally different, limitations.</description>

      <title>VarSaw: Application-tailored Measurement Error Mitigation for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For potential quantum advantage, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) need high accuracy beyond the capability of today's NISQ devices, and thus will benefit from error mitigation. In this work we are interested in mitigating measurement errors which occur during qubit measurements after circuit execution and tend to be the most error-prone operations, especially detrimental to VQAs. Prior work, JigSaw, has shown that measuring only small subsets of circuit qubits at a time and collecting results across all such subset circuits can reduce measurement errors. Then, running the entire (global) original circuit and extracting the qubit-qubit measurement correlations can be used in conjunction with the subsets to construct a high-fidelity output distribution of the original circuit. Unfortunately, the execution cost of JigSaw scales polynomially in the number of qubits in the circuit, and when compounded by the number of circuits and iterations in VQAs, the resulting execution cost quickly turns insurmountable.
  To combat this, we propose VarSaw, which improves JigSaw in an application-tailored manner, by identifying considerable redundancy in the JigSaw approach for VQAs: spatial redundancy across subsets from different VQA circuits and temporal redundancy across globals from different VQA iterations. VarSaw then eliminates these forms of redundancy by commuting the subset circuits and selectively executing the global circuits, reducing computational cost (in terms of the number of circuits executed) over naive JigSaw for VQA by 25x on average and up to 1000x, for the same VQA accuracy. Further, it can recover, on average, 45% of the infidelity from measurement errors in the noisy VQA baseline. Finally, it improves fidelity by 55%, on average, over JigSaw for a fixed computational budget. VarSaw can be accessed here: https://github.com/siddharthdangwal/VarSaw.</description>

      <title>Swarm Body: Embodied Swarm Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The human brain's plasticity allows for the integration of artificial body parts into the human body. Leveraging this, embodied systems realize intuitive interactions with the environment. We introduce a novel concept: embodied swarm robots. Swarm robots constitute a collective of robots working in harmony to achieve a common objective, in our case, serving as functional body parts. Embodied swarm robots can dynamically alter their shape, density, and the correspondences between body parts and individual robots. We contribute an investigation of the influence on embodiment of swarm robot-specific factors derived from these characteristics, focusing on a hand. Our paper is the first to examine these factors through virtual reality (VR) and real-world robot studies to provide essential design considerations and applications of embodied swarm robots. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we identified a system configuration to achieve the embodiment of swarm robots.</description>
