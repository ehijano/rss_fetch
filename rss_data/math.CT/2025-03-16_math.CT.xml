      <title>A study of Kock's fat Delta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of weak identity structures in higher category theory we explore the fat Delta category, a modification of the simplex category introduced by J. Kock. We provide a comprehensive study of fat Delta via the theory of monads with arities, and use these results to show that fat Delta is a hypermoment category in the sense of C. Berger. Specifically, by proving that the free relative semicategory monad is strongly cartesian and identifying a dense generator, the theory of monads with arities immediately gives rise to the nerve theorem. We characterise the essential image of the nerve via the Segal condition, and show that fat Delta possesses an active-inert factorisation system. Building on these results, we also establish an isomorphism between two presentations of fat Delta and show that it is a strongly unital and extensional hypermoment category.</description>

      <title>2-Functoriality of Initial Semantics, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initial semantics aims to model inductive structures and their properties, and to provide them with recursion principles respecting these properties. An ubiquitous example is the fold operator for lists. We are concerned with initial semantics that model languages with variable binding and their substitution structure, and that provide substitution-safe recursion principles. There are different approaches to implementing languages with variable binding depending on the choice of representation for contexts and free variables, such as unscoped syntax, or well-scoped syntax with finite or infinite contexts. Abstractly, each approach corresponds to choosing a different monoidal category to model contexts and binding, each choice yielding a different notion of "model" for the same abstract specification (or "signature"). In this work, we provide tools to compare and relate the models obtained from a signature for different choices of monoidal category. We do so by showing that initial semantics naturally has a 2-categorical structure when parametrized by the monoidal category modeling contexts. We thus can relate models obtained from different choices of monoidal categories provided the monoidal categories themselves are related. In particular, we use our results to relate the models of the different implementation -- de Bruijn vs locally nameless, finite vs infinite contexts -- , and to provide a generalized recursion principle for simply-typed syntax.</description>

      <title>A Type Theory for Comprehension Categories with Applications to Subtyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a type theory that we show is an internal language for comprehension categories. This type theory is closely related to Martin-L\"of type theory (MLTT). Indeed, semantics of MLTT are often given in comprehension categories, albeit usually only in discrete or full ones. As we explain, requiring a comprehension category to be full or discrete can be understood as removing one `dimension' of morphisms. Thus, in our syntax, we recover this extra dimension. We show that this extra dimension can be used to encode subtyping in a natural way. Important instances of non-full comprehension categories include ones used for constructive or univalent intensional models of MLTT and directed type theory, and so our syntax is a more faithful internal language for these than is MLTT.</description>

      <title>Every motive is the motive of a stable $\infty$-category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a class of motivic equivalences of small stable $\infty$-categories $W_{\mathrm{mot}}$ and show that the Dwyer--Kan localization functor $\mathrm{Cat}^{\mathrm{perf}}_\infty \to \mathrm{Cat}^{\mathrm{perf}}_\infty[W_{\mathrm{mot}}^{-1}]$ is the universal localizing invariant in the sense of Blumberg--Gepner--Tabuada. In particular, we show that every object in its target $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ can be represented as $\mathcal{U}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathcal{C})$ for some small stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$. As another consequence, and using work of Efimov, we improve the universal property of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ and show that any $\aleph_1$-finitary localizing invariant factors uniquely through it.</description>

      <title>Weakly globular double categories and weak units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.11180v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly globular double categories are a model of weak $2$-categories based on the notion of weak globularity, and they are known to be suitably equivalent to Tamsamani $2$-categories. Fair $2$-categories, introduced by J. Kock, model weak $2$-categories with strictly associative compositions and weak unit laws. In this paper we establish a direct comparison between weakly globular double categories and fair $2$-categories and prove they are equivalent after localisation with respect to the $2$-equivalences. This comparison sheds new light on weakly globular double categories as encoding a strictly associative, though not strictly unital, composition, as well as the category of weak units via the weak globularity condition.</description>

      <title>Ultracategories as colax algebras for a pseudo-monad on CAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a result inspired by a conjecture by Shulman claiming that ultracategories as defined by Lurie are normal colax algebras for a certain pseudo-monad on the category of categories CAT. Such definition allows us to regard left and right ultrafunctors as defined by Lurie as instances of lax/colax algebras morphisms</description>

      <title>Higher extension closure and $d$-exact categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any weakly idempotent complete $d$-exact category is equivalent to a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a weakly idempotent complete exact category, and that any weakly idempotent complete algebraic $(d+2)$-angulated category is equivalent to a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of an algebraic triangulated category closed under $d$-shifts. Furthermore, we show that the ambient exact category of a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory is unique up to exact equivalence, assuming it is weakly idempotent complete. This follows from the inclusion of the $d$-cluster tilting subcategory satisfying a universal property. As a consequence of our theory we also get that any $d$-torsion class is $d$-cluster tilting in an extension-closed subcategory, and we recover the fact that any $d$-wide subcategory is $d$-cluster tilting in a unique wide subcategory. In the last part of the paper we rectify the description of the $d$-exact structure of a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a non-weakly idempotent complete exact category.</description>
