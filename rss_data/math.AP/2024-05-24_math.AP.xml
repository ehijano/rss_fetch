      <title>Non-existence of solutions for a non-Gaussian equation in fractional time with Osgood type nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Osgood functions in the source term are used to produce results for non-existence of local solutions into the framework of non-Gaussian diffusion equations. The critical exponent for non-existence of local solutions is found to depend on the fractional derivative, the non-Gaussian diffusion and the non-linear term. The instantaneous blow-up phenomenon is studied by exploiting estimates of the fundamental solutions. Nevertheless, theory of super-solutions and fixed points are combined for showing existence of global solutions. In this case, the critical exponent for existence of global solutions depends only on the last two parameters above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study a global existence and blow-up of the positive solutions to the initial-boundary value problem of the nonlinear pseudo-parabolic equation for the Baouendi-Grushin operator. The approach is based on the concavity argument and the Poincar\'e inequality related to the Baouendi-Grushin operator from [24], inspired by the recent work [21].</description>

      <title>Sharp order of vanishing for parabolic equations, nodal set estimates and Landis type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new sharp estimate of the order of vanishing of solutions to parabolic equations with variable coefficients. For real-analytic leading coefficients, we prove a localised estimate of the nodal set, at a given time-level, that generalises the celebrated one of Donnelly and Fefferman. We also establish Landis type results for global solutions.</description>

      <title>Interior H\"older regularity of the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the interior H\"older regularity of solutions to the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In particular, we focus on the cases with singular right-hand side, which arise from the study of the semigeostrophic equation and singular Abreu equations. In the two-dimensional case, we give a new proof of the Caffarelli-Guti\'errez H\"older estimate (\textit{Amer. J. Math.} \textbf{119} (1997), no.\,2, 423-465) and the result of Le (\textit{Comm. Math. Phys.} \textbf{360} (2018), no.\,1, 271-305) for the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation with singular right-hand side term in divergence form. The main new ingredient in the proof contains the application of the partial Legendre transform to the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation. Building on this idea, we also establish a new Moser-Trudinger type inequality in dimension two. In higher dimensions, we derive the interior H\"older estimate under certain integrability assumptions on the coefficients using De Giorgi's iteration.</description>

      <title>Pointwise bounds on Dirichlet Green's functions for a singular drift term plus Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show optimal upper and lower pointwise estimates for the Green's function for elliptic operators that are the sum of a Laplacian term and a singular drift term that behaves like the inverse distance to the boundary, in not necessarily bounded chord-arc domains in $\R^{n}$ with $n\geq 3$. In particular, such a term does not belong to the Lorentz space or the Kato space considered in other recent work of Sakellaris and Mourgoglou. We also do not make any assumptions on the divergence of the drift term. Adopting standards arguments, while assuming the Bourgain estimate on the elliptic measure, this also shows doubling of the corresponding elliptic measure, in the chord-arc domains.</description>

      <title>Inverse coefficient problems for the heat equation with fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we study inverse problems related to determining the time-dependent coefficient and unknown source function of fractional heat equations. Our approach shows that having just one set of data at an observation point ensures the existence of a weak solution for the inverse problem. Furthermore, if there is an additional datum at the observation point, it leads to a specific formula for the time-dependent source coefficient. Moreover, we investigate inverse problems involving non-local data and recovering the space-dependent source function of the fractional heat equation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a nonlinear infection viral propagation model with one fixed boundary and one free boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a nonlinear infection viral propagation model with diffusion, in which, the left boundary is fixed and with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, while the right boundary is free. We find that the habitat always expands to the half line $[0, \infty)$, and that the virus and infected cells always die out when the {\it Basic Reproduction Number} $\mathcal{R}_0\le 1$, while the virus and infected cells have persistence properties when $\mathcal{R}_0&gt;1$. To obtain the persistence properties of virus and infected cells when $\mathcal{R}_0&gt;1$, the most work of this paper focuses on the existence and uniqueness of positive equilibrium solutions for subsystems and the existence of positive equilibrium solutions for the entire system.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of the von Neumann equation in the semi-classical limit. Part I : numerical algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to discretize the von Neumann equation, which is efficient in the semi-classical limit. This method is first based on the so called Weyl's variables to address the stiffness associated with the equation. Then, by applying a truncated Hermite expansion of the density operator, we successfully handle this stiffness. Additionally, we develop a finite volume approximation for practical implementation and conduct numerical simulations to illustrate the efficiency of our approach. This asymptotic preserving numerical approximation, combined with the use of Hermite polynomials, provides an efficient tool for solving the von Neumann equation in all regimes, near classical or not.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis and Asymptotic Decay of the Solutions to Multilayered Structure-Stokes Fluid Interaction PDE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the dynamics of a multilayered structure-fluid interaction (FSI) PDE system is considered. Here, the coupling of 3D Stokes and 3D elastic dynamics is realized via an additional 2D elastic equation on the boundary interface. Such modeling PDE systems appear in the mathematical modeling of eukaryotic cells and vascular blood flow in mammalian arteries. We analyze the long time behavior of solutions to such FSI coupled system in the sense of strong stability.
  Our proof is based on an analysis of the spectrum of the associated semigroup generator $\mathbf{A}$ which in particular entails the elimination of all three parts of the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ from the imaginary axis. In order to avoid steady states in our stability analysis, we firstly show that zero is an eigenvalue for the operator $\mathbf{A}$, and we provide a characterization of the (one dimensional) zero eigenspace $Null(\mathbf{A}).$ In turn, we address the issue of asymptotic decay of the solution to the zero state for any initial data taken from the orthogonal complement of the zero eigenspace $Null(\mathbf{A})^{\bot}.$</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the following Neumann problem in a ball $$\begin{cases} -\Delta_p u+u^{p-1}=u^{q-1}\quad&amp;\text{in }B,\\ u&gt;0,\,u\text{ radial}\quad&amp;\text{in }B,\\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=0\quad&amp;\text{on }\partial B, \end{cases}$$ with $1&lt;p&lt;q&lt;\infty$, we prove continuous dependence on $p$, for radially nondecreasing solutions. As a byproduct, we obtain an existence result for nonconstant solutions in the case $p\in(1,2)$ and $q$ larger than an explicit threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that if $L_p$ Gaussian surface area measure is proportional to the spherical Lebesgue measure, then the corresponding convex body has to be a centered disk when $p\in[0,1)$. Moreover, we investigate $C^0$ estimate of the corresponding convex bodies when the density function of their Gaussian surface area measures have the uniform upper and lower bound. We obtain convex bodies' uniform upper and lower bound when $p=0$ in asymmetric situation and $p\in(0,1)$ in symmetric situation. In fact, for $p\in(0,1)$ , there is a counterexample to claim the uniform bound does not exist in asymmetric situation.</description>

      <title>Optimal global $BV$ regularity for 1-Laplace type BVP's with singular lower order terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a complete characterization of the regularity properties of the solutions associated to the homogeneous Dirichlet problem \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle - \Delta_1 u= h(u)f &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\ \newline
  u=0 &amp; \text{on } \partial \Omega, 
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary, $f \in L^m(\Omega)$ with $m\geq 1$ is a nonnegative function and $h\colon \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+$ is continuous, possibly singular at the origin and bounded at infinity.
  Without any growth restrictions on $h$ at zero, we prove existence of global finite energy solutions in $BV(\Omega)$ under sharp conditions on the summability of $f$ and on the behaviour of $h$ at infinity. Roughly speaking, the faster $h$ goes to zero at infinity, the less regularity is required on $f$. In contrast to the $p$-Laplacian case ($p&gt;1$), we show that the behaviour of $h$ at the origin plays essentially no role.
  The main result contains an extension of the celebrated one of Lazer-McKenna (\cite{lm}) to the case of the $1$-Laplacian as principal operator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the degenerate parabolic $p$-Laplacian,
  $ \partial_t u - v^{-1}{\rm div}(|\sqrt{Q} \nabla u|^{p-2} Q \nabla u)=0$,
  where the degeneracy is controlled by a matrix $Q$ and a weight $v$.
  With mild integrability assumptions on $Q$ and $v$, we prove the
  existence and uniqueness of solutions on any interval $[0,T]$. If we further assume
  the existence of a degenerate Sobolev inequality with gain, the
  degeneracy again controlled by $v$ and $Q$, then we can prove both
  finite time extinction and ultracontractive bounds. Moreover, we
  show that there is equivalence between the existence of
  ultracontractive bounds and the weighted Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove that entire critical points $(u,\nabla)$ of the self-dual $U(1)$-Yang-Mills-Higgs functional $E_1$, with energy
  $$E_1(u,\nabla;B_R):=\int_{B_R}\left[|\nabla u|^2+\frac{(1-|u|^2)^2}{4}+|F_\nabla|^2\right]\leq(2\pi+\tau(n)) \omega_{n-2}R^{n-2}$$
  for all $R&gt;0$, have unique blow-down. Moreover, we show that they are two-dimensional in ambient dimension $2\leq n\leq4$, or in any dimension $n\ge2$ assuming that $(u,\nabla)$ is a local minimizer, thus establishing a co-dimension-two analogue of Savin's theorem. The main ingredient is an Allard-type improvement of flatness.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the electron magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equation on the 3D torus $\mathbb T^3$. For a given smooth vector field $H$ with zero mean and zero divergence, we can construct a weak solution $B$ to the electron MHD in the space $L^\gamma_tW^{1,p}_x$ for appropriate $(\gamma, p)$ such that $B$ is arbitrarily close to $H$ in this space. The parameters $\gamma$ and $p$ depend on the resistivity. As a consequence, non-uniqueness of weak solutions is obtained for the electron MHD with hyper-resistivity. In particular, non-Leray-Hopf solutions can be constructed. As a byproduct, we also show the existence of weak solutions to the electron MHD without resistivity.</description>

      <title>Relaxing the sharp density stratification and columnar motion assumptions in layered shallow water systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously justify the bilayer shallow-water system as an approximation to the hydrostatic Euler equations in situations where the flow is density-stratified with close-to-piecewise constant density profiles, and close-to-columnar velocity profiles. Our theory accommodates with continuous stratification, so that admissible deviations from bilayer profiles are not pointwise small. This leads us to define refined approximate solutions that are able to describe at first order the flow in the pycnocline. Because the hydrostatic Euler equations are not known to enjoy suitable stability estimates, we rely on thickness-diffusivity contributions proposed by Gent and McWilliams. Our strategy also applies to one-layer and multilayer frameworks.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results, but the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we advocate an alternative view-point that sheds light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V.\;Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model enables a deep connection between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representation theory of Lie algebras as pursued in quantum theory. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. The transferal of outcomes, from finite-dimensional matrices to infinite-dimensional fluids, is then supported by hard-fought results in quantization theory -- the field which describes the limit between quantum and classical physics. We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Influence of the competition in the spatial dynamics of a population of Aedes mosquitoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a competitive reaction-diffusion system modelling the interaction between several species of mosquitoes. In particular, it has been observed that in tropical regions, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are well established in urban area whereas Aedes albopictus mosquitoes spread widely in forest region. The aim of this paper is to propose a simple mathematical system modeling this segregation phenomenon. Moreprecisely, after modeling the dynamics by a competitive reaction-diffusion system with spatial heterogeneity, we prove that when there is a strong competition between these two species of mosquitoes, solutions to this system converge in long time to segregated stationary solutions. Then we study the influence of this strong competition on the success of a population replacement strategy using Wolbachia bacteria. Our theoretical results are also illustrated by some numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On fractional parabolic systems of vector order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the Cauchy problem for the system of partial differential equations of fractional order $D_t^{\mathcal{B}} {U}(t,x) + \mathbb{A}(D) {U} (t,x)=H(t,x) $. Here $U$ and $H$ are vector-functions, the $m\times m$ matrix of differential operators $\mathbb{A}(D)$ is triangular (elements above or below the diagonal are zero). Operators located on the diagonal are elliptic. The main distinctive feature of this system is that the vector-order $\mathcal{B}$ has different components $\beta_j\in (0,1]$, and $\beta_j$ are not necessarily rational. Sufficient conditions (in some cases they are necessary) on the initial function and the right-hand side of the equation are found to ensure the existence of a classical solution. Note that the existence of a classical solution to systems of fractional differential equations was studied by various authors, but in all these works the fractional order had the same components for each equation: $\beta_j=\beta$, $j=1,...,m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with entropy solutions of scalar conservation laws of the form $\partial_{t}u+\diver f=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^d\times(0,\infty)$. The flux $f=f(x,u)$ depends explicitly on the spatial variable $x$. Using an extension of Kruzkov's method, we establish the $L^1$-contraction property of entropy solutions under minimal regularity assumptions on the flux.</description>

      <title>Tug-of-war games related to oblique derivative boundary value problems with the normalized $p$-Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with game-theoretic interpretations to the following oblique derivative boundary value problem \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \Delta_{p}^{N}u=0 &amp; \textrm{in $ \Omega$,}\\ \langle \beta , Du \rangle + \gamma u = \gamma G &amp; \textrm{on $ \partial \Omega$,}\\ \end{array} \right. \end{align*} where $\Delta_{p}^{N}$ is the normalized $p$-Laplacian. This problem can be regarded as a generalized version of the Robin boundary value problem for the Laplace equations. We construct several types of stochastic games associated with this problem by using `shrinking tug-of-war'. For the value functions of such games, we investigate the properties such as existence, uniqueness, regularity and convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider variational problem related to entropy maximization in the two-dimensional Euler equations, in order to investigate the long-time dynamics of solutions with bounded vorticity. Using variations on the classical min-max principle and borrowing ideas from optimal transportation and quantitative rearrangement inequalities, we prove results on the structure of entropy maximizers arising in the investigation of the long-time behavior of vortex patches. We further show that the same techniques apply in the study of stability of the canonical Gibbs measure associated to a system of point vortices.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis on principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. We introduce a semiclassical framework, called Borel-Weil calculus, to investigate $G$-equivariant (pseudo)differential operators acting on $G$-principal bundles over closed manifolds. In this calculus, the semiclassical parameters correspond to the highest roots in the Weyl chamber of the group $G$ that parametrize irreducible representations, and operators are pseudodifferential in the base variable, with values in Toeplitz operators on the flag manifold associated to the group. This monograph unfolds two main applications of our calculus.
  Firstly, in the realm of dynamical systems, we obtain explicit sufficient conditions for rapid mixing of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic flows obtained as extensions of an Anosov flow to a $G$-principal bundle (for an arbitrary $G$). In particular, when $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$, we prove that the flow on the extension is rapid mixing whenever the Anosov flow is not jointly integrable, and the circle bundle is not torsion. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that ergodicity of the extension is equivalent to rapid mixing. Secondly, we study the spectral theory of sub-elliptic Laplacians obtained as horizontal Laplacians of a $G$-equivariant connection on a principal bundle. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that the horizontal Laplacian is globally hypoelliptic as soon as the connection has a dense holonomy group in $G$. Notably, this result encompasses all flat bundles with a dense monodromy group in $G$. We also prove a quantum ergodicity result for flat principal bundles with dense holonomy group if the base space has Anosov geodesic flow (e.g. in negative sectional curvature).
  We believe that this monograph will serve as a cornerstone for future investigations applying the Borel-Weil calculus across different fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for deriving rigorous and efficient bounds on the approximation error of deep neural networks in PDE models characterized by branching mechanisms, such as waves, Schr\"odinger equations, and other dispersive models. This framework utilizes the probabilistic setting established by Henry-Labord\`ere and Touzi. We illustrate this approach by providing rigorous bounds on the approximation error for both linear and nonlinear waves in physical dimensions $d=1,2,3$, and analyze their respective computational costs starting from time zero. We investigate two key scenarios: one involving a linear perturbative source term, and another focusing on pure nonlinear internal interactions.</description>

      <title>Weak uniqueness for singular stochastic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We put forward a new method for proving weak uniqueness of stochastic equations with singular drifts driven by a non-Markov or infinite-dimensional noise. We apply our method to study stochastic heat equation (SHE) driven by Gaussian space-time white noise $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u_t(x)=\frac12 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}u_t(x)+b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x), \quad t&gt;0,\, x\in D\subset\mathbb{R}, $$ and multidimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by fractional Brownian motion with the Hurst index $H\in(0,1/2)$ $$ d X_t=b(X_t) dt +d B_t^H,\quad t&gt;0. $$ In both cases $b$ is a generalized function in the Besov space $\mathcal{B}^\alpha_{\infty,\infty}$, $\alpha&lt;0$. Well-known pathwise uniqueness results for these equations do not cover the entire range of the parameter $\alpha$, for which weak existence holds. What happens in the range where weak existence holds but pathwise uniqueness is unknown has been an open problem. We settle this problem and show that for SHE weak uniqueness holds for $\alpha&gt;-3/2$, and for SDE it holds for $\alpha&gt;1/2-1/(2H)$; thus, in both cases, it holds in the entire desired range of values of $\alpha$. This extends seminal results of Catellier and Gubinelli (2016) and Gy\"ongy and Pardoux (1993) to the weak well-posedness setting. To establish these results, we develop a new strategy, combining ideas from ergodic theory (generalized couplings of Hairer-Mattingly-Kulik-Scheutzow) with stochastic sewing of L\^e.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation perturbed by a space-dependent noise is a system of fourth order stochastic PDEs which models the evolution of magnetic spin fields in ferromagnetic materials at elevated temperatures, taking into account longitudinal damping, long-range interactions, and noise-induced phenomena at high temperatures. In this paper, we show the existence of a martingale solution (which is analytically strong) to the stochastic LLBar equation posed in a bounded domain $\mathscr{D}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d=1,2,3$. We also prove pathwise uniqueness of the solution, which implies the existence of a unique probabilistically strong solution. Finally, we show the Feller property of the Markov semigroup associated with the strong solution, which implies the existence of invariant measures.</description>

Abstract: We establish in the present paper two sub-gradient estimates for the quaternionic contact (qc) heat equation on a compact qc manifold of dimension $4n+3$, provided some positivity conditions are satisfied. These are qc versions of the prominent Li-Yau gradient estimate in Riemannian geometry. Another goal of this paper is to get two Perelman-type entropy formulas for the qc heat equation on a compact qc-Einstein manifold of dimension $4n+3$ with non-negative qc scalar curvature (e.g. compact $3$-Sasakian manifold), as well as an integral sub-gradient estimate for the positive solutions of the qc heat equation.</description>

      <title>The Initial Value Problem for Singular SPDEs via Rough Paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.00490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution we develop a solution theory for singular quasilinear stochastic partial differential equations subject to an initial condition. We obtain our solution theory as a perturbation of the rough path approach developed to handle the space-time periodic problem by Otto and Weber (2019). As in their work, we assume that the forcing is of class $C^{\alpha -2}$ for $\alpha \in (\frac{2}{3},1)$ and space-time periodic and, additionally, that the initial condition is of class $C^{\alpha}$ and periodic. We contribute to the analytic aspects of the theory. Indeed, we show that we can enforce the initial condition via correcting the previously obtained space-time periodic solution with an initial boundary layer which may be handled in a completely deterministic manner. Uniqueness is obtained in the class of solutions which are corrected in this way by an initial boundary layer. Moreover, stability of the solutions with respect to perturbations of the data is established.</description>

      <title>A stability theory beyond the co-rotational setting for critical Wave Maps blow up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.08843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit non-equivariant perturbations of the blowup solutions constructed in \cite{KST} for energy critical wave maps into $\mathbb{S}^2$. Our admissible class of perturbations is an open set in some sufficiently smooth topology and vanishes near the light cone. We show that the blowup solutions from \cite{KST} are rigid under such perturbations, including the space-time location of blowup. As blowup is approached, the dynamics agree with the classification obtained in \cite{DJKM}, and all six symmetry parameters converge to limiting values. Compared to the previous work \cite{KMiao} in which the rigidity of the blowup solutions from \cite{KST} under equivariant perturbations was proved, the class of perturbations considered in the present work does not impose any symmetry restrictions. Separation of variables and decomposing into angular Fourier modes leads to an infinite system of coupled nonlinear equations, which we solve for small admissible data. The nonlinear analysis is based on the distorted Fourier transform, associated with an infinite family of Bessel type Schr\"odinger operators on the half-line indexed by the angular momentum~$n$. A semi-classical WKB-type spectral analysis relative to the parameter $\hbar=\frac{1}{n+1}$ for large $|n|$ allows us to effectively determine the distorted Fourier basis for the entire infinite family. Our linear analysis is based on the global Liouville-Green transform as in the earlier works \cite{CSST, CDST}.</description>

      <title>Long time decay and asymptotics for the complex mKdV equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotics of the complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equation $\partial_t u + \partial_x^3 u = -|u|^2 \partial_x u$, which can be used to model vortex filament dynamics. In the real-valued case, it is known that solutions with small, localized initial data exhibit modified scattering for $|x| \geq t^{1/3}$ and behave self-similarly for $|x| \leq t^{1/3}$. We prove that the same asymptotics hold for complex mKdV. The major difficulty in the complex case is that the nonlinearity cannot be expressed as a derivative, which makes the low-frequency dynamics harder to control. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the decomposition $u = S + w$, where $S$ is a self-similar solution with the same mean as $u$ and $w$ is a remainder that has better decay. By using the explicit expression for $S$, we are able to get better low-frequency behavior for $u$ than we could from dispersive estimates alone. An advantage of our method is its robustness: It does not depend on the precise algebraic structure of the equation, and as such can be more readily adapted to other contexts.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves with continuous profile for hyperbolic Keller-Segel equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06920v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work describes a hyperbolic model for cell-cell repulsion with population dynamics. We consider the pressure produced by a population of cells to describe their motion. We assume that cells try to avoid crowded areas and prefer locally empty spaces far away from the carrying capacity. Here, our main goal is to prove the existence of traveling waves with continuous profiles. This article complements our previous results about sharp traveling waves. We conclude the paper with numerical simulations of the PDE problem, illustrating such a result.</description>

      <title>On the limit spectrum of a degenerate operator in the framework of periodic homogenization or singular perturbation problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we perform the analysis of the spectrum of a degenerate operator $A_\var$ corresponding to the stationary heat equation in a $\var$-periodic composite medium having two components with high contrast diffusivity. We prove that although $ A_\var$ is a bounded self-adjoint operator with compact resolvent, the limits of its eigenvalues when the size $\var$ of the medium tends to zero, make up a part of the spectrum of a unbounded operator $ A_0$, namely the eigenvalues of $ A_0$ located on the left of the first eigenvalue of the bi-dimensional Laplacian with homogeneous Dirichlet condition on the boundary of the representative cell. We also show that the homogenized problem does not differ in any way from the one-dimensional problem obtained in the study of the local reduction of dimension induced by the homogenization.</description>

      <title>On the threshold nature of the Dini continuity for a Glassey derivative-type nonlinearity in a critical semilinear wave equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11478v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present manuscript, we determine the critical condition for the nonlinearity in a semilinear wave equation with a derivative-type nonlinearity. More precisely, we consider a nonlinear term depending on the time derivative of the solution, which is the product of a power nonlinearity with critical Glassey exponent and a modulus of continuity. By employing Zhou's approach along a certain characteristic line, we prove the blow-up in finite time for classical solutions (under a suitable sign condition for the Cauchy data) and we derive upper bound estimates for the lifespan for a not Dini continuous modulus of continuity. Furthermore, in the 3-dimensional and radially symmetric case, by using weighted $L^{\infty}$ estimates, we establish the global existence of small data solutions for a Dini continuous modulus of continuity, and lower bound estimates for the lifespan in the not Dini continuous case. These results provide the regularity threshold (i.e. the Dini condition) for the modulus of continuity in the nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup for the Fourier-restricted Euler and hypodissipative Navier-Stokes model equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Fourier-restricted Euler and hypodissipative Navier--Stokes equations. These equations are analogous to the Euler and hypodissipative Navier--Stokes equations respectively, but with the Helmholtz projection replaced by a projection onto a more restrictive constraint space; the $(u\cdot\nabla)u$ nonlinearity is otherwise unchanged. The constraint space restricts the divergence-free velocity to specific Fourier modes, which have a dyadic shell structure, and are constructed iteratively using permutations.
  In the inviscid case -- and in the hypo-viscous case when $\alpha&lt;\frac{\log(3)}{6\log(2)} \approx .264$ -- we prove finite-time blowup for a set of solutions with a discrete group of symmetries. Our blowup Ansatz is odd, permutation symmetric, and mirror symmetric about the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=0$. The Fourier-restricted Euler and hypodissipative Navier--Stokes equations respect both the energy equality and the identity for enstrophy growth from the full Euler and hypodissipative Navier--Stokes equations respectively, which is a substantial advance over the previous literature on Euler and Navier--Stokes model equations.</description>

Abstract: Adding some nontrivial terms composed from a microstructure, we prove the existence of a global-in-time weak solution, whose enstrophy is bounded for all the time, to an incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes-Fourier system for arbitrary initial data. It cannot be expected to directly derive the energy inequality for this new system of equations. The main idea is to employ the hydrodynamic limit from the Boltzmann equation with periodic velocity and a specially designed collision operator.</description>

      <title>On the stability of Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality in R^2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dolbeault, Esteban and Loss [Invent. Math., 2016] obtained an optimal rigidity result, that is, when $a&lt;0$ and $b_{\mathrm{FS}}(a)\leq b&lt;a+1$ the extremal function for best constant $\mathcal{S}_{a,b}&gt;0$ of the following Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality is symmetry, \[ \mathcal{S}_{a,b}\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}|x|^{-qb}|u|^q \mathrm{d}x\right)^{\frac{2}{q}}
  \leq \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}|x|^{-2a}|\nabla u|^2 \mathrm{d}x, \quad \mbox{for all}\quad u\in C^\infty_0(\mathbb{R}^2), \] where $b_{\mathrm{FS}}(a):=a-\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+1}}$, $q=\frac{2}{b-a}$. An important task is investigating the stability of extremal functions set $\mathcal{M}$ for this inequality. Firstly, we classify all solutions of the linearized problem related to the extremals which fills the work of Felli and Schneider [J. Diff. Equ., 2003]. When $b_{\mathrm{FS}}(a)&lt; b&lt;a+1$, we investigate the stability of previous inequality by using spectral estimate combined with a compactness argument that
  \begin{align*}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}|x|^{-2a}|\nabla u|^2 \mathrm{d}x
  -\mathcal{S}_{a,b}\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}|x|^{-qb}|u|^q \mathrm{d}x\right)^{\frac{2}{q}}
  \geq \mathcal{B}
  \mathrm{dist}(u,\mathcal{M})^2,\quad \mbox{for all}\quad u\in C^\infty_0(\mathbb{R}^2),
  \end{align*}
  for some $\mathcal{B}&gt;0$, however it is false when $b=b_{\mathrm{FS}}(a)$, which extends the work of Wei and Wu [Math. Ann., 2022] to $\mathbb{R}^2$. Furthermore, we obtain the existence of minimizers for $\mathcal{B}$ which extends the recent work of K\"{o}nig [J. Eur. Math. Soc., to appear].</description>

      <title>Thermocapillary Thin Films: Periodic Steady States and Film Rupture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stationary, periodic solutions to the thermocapillary thin-film model
  \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t h + \partial_x \Bigl(h^3(\partial_x^3 h - g\partial_x h) + M\frac{h^2}{(1+h)^2}\partial_xh\Bigr) = 0,\quad t&gt;0,\ x\in \mathbb{R},
  \end{equation*} which can be derived from the B\'enard-Marangoni problem via a lubrication approximation. When the Marangoni number $M$ increases beyond a critical value $M^*$, the constant solution becomes spectrally unstable via a (conserved) long-wave instability and periodic stationary solutions bifurcate. For a fixed period, we find that these solutions lie on a global bifurcation curve of stationary, periodic solutions with a fixed wave number and mass. Furthermore, we show that the stationary periodic solutions on the global bifurcation branch converge to a weak stationary periodic solution which exhibits film rupture. The proofs rely on a Hamiltonian formulation of the stationary problem and the use of analytic global bifurcation theory. Finally, we show the instability of the bifurcating solutions close to the bifurcation point and give a formal derivation of the amplitude equation governing the dynamics close to the onset of instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scalar conservation law with source in a bounded open interval $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb R$. The equation arises from the macroscopic evolution of an interacting particle system. The source term models an external effort driving the solution to a given function $\varrho$ with an intensity function $V:\Omega\to\mathbb R_+$ that grows to infinity at $\partial\Omega$. We define the entropy solution $u \in L^\infty$ and prove the uniqueness. When $V$ is integrable, $u$ satisfies the boundary conditions introduced in [F. Otto, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 1996], which allows the solution to attain values at $\partial\Omega$ different from the given boundary data. When the integral of $V$ blows up, $u$ satisfies an energy estimate and presents essential continuity at $\partial\Omega$ in a weak sense.</description>

Abstract: We provide sparse estimates for gradients of solutions to divergence form elliptic partial differential equations in terms of the source data. We give a general result of Meyers (or Gehring) type, a result for linear equations with VMO coefficients and a result for linear equations with Dini continuous coefficients. In addition, we provide an abstract theorem conditional on PDE estimates available. The linear results have the full range of weighted estimates with Muckenhoupt weights as a consequence.</description>

      <title>Global unique solutions to the planar inhomogeneous Navier--Stokes--Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of an electrically conducting imcompressible fluid with nonconstant density can be described by a set of equations combining the continuity, momentum and Maxwell's equations; altogether known as the inhomogeneous Navier--Stokes--Maxwell system.
  In this paper, we focus on the global well-posedness of these equations in two dimensions. Specifically, we are able to prove the existence of global energy solutions, provided that the initial velocity field belongs to the Besov space $\dot{B}^{r}_{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, with $r=-1+\frac{2}{p}$, for some $p\in (1,2)$, while the initial electromagnetic field enjoys some $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ Sobolev regularity, for some $s \geq 2-\frac{2}{p} \in (0,1)$, and whenever the initial fluid density is bounded pointwise and close to a nonnegative constant. Moreover, if it is assumed that $s&gt;\frac{1}{2}$, then the solution is shown to be unique in the class of all energy solutions.
  It is to be emphasized that the solutions constructed here are global and uniformly bounded with respect to the speed of light $c\in (0,\infty)$. This important fact allows us to derive the inhomogeneous MHD system as the speed of light tends to infinity.</description>

Abstract: We derive global curvature estimates for closed strictly star-shaped (n-2)-convex hypersurfaces in warped product spaces, satisfying the prescribed (n-2)-curvature equation with a general right-hand side. The proof is inspired by the recent breakthrough of [Guan-Ren-Wang CPAM 2015] and it can be readily adapted to establish curvature estimates for semi-convex and (k+1)-convex solutions to the general k-curvature equation. Furthermore, it can also be used to prove the same estimates for prescribed curvature measure type equations.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a quasiconvex Lipschitz domain and $A(x)$ be a $d \times d$ uniformly elliptic, symmetric matrix with Lipschitz coefficients. Assume a nontrivial $u$ solves $-\nabla \cdot (A(x) \nabla u) = 0$ in $\Omega$, and $u$ vanishes on $\Sigma = \partial \Omega \cap B$ for some ball $B$. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the existence of a countable collection of open balls $(B_i)_i$ such that the restriction of $u$ to $B_i \cap \Omega$ maintains a consistent sign. Furthermore, for any compact subset $K$ of $\Sigma$, the set difference $K \setminus \bigcup_i B_i$ is shown to possess a Minkowski dimension that is strictly less than $d - 1 - \epsilon$. As a consequence, we prove Lin's conjecture in quasiconvex domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a type of Hardy-Sobolev inequality, whose weight function is singular on the whole domain boundary. We are concerned with the attainability of the best constant of such inequality. In dimension two, we link the inequality to a conformally invariant one using the conformal radius of the domain. The best constant of such inequality on a smooth bounded domain is achieved if and only if the domain is non-convex. In higher dimensions, the best constant is achieved if the domain has negative mean curvature somewhere. If the mean curvature vanishes but is non-umbilic somewhere, we also establish the attainability for some special cases. In the other direction, we also show the best constant is not achieved if the domain is sufficiently close to a ball in $C^2$ sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11590v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the asymptotics of the fractional Laplacian as $s\to 0^+$ on any complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, both of finite and infinite volume. Surprisingly enough, when $M$ is not stochastically complete this asymptotics is related to the existence of bounded harmonic functions on $M$.
  As a corollary, we can find the asymptotics of the fractional $s$-perimeter on (essentially) every complete manifold, generalising both the existing results for $\mathbb{R}^n$ and for the Gaussian space. In doing so, from many sets $E\subset M$ we are able to produce a bounded harmonic function associated to $E$, which in general can be non-constant.</description>

Abstract: Our work is dedicated to the introduction and investigation of a new asymptotic correlation relation in the field of mean field models and limits. This new notion, order (as opposed to chaos), revolves around a tendency for self organisation in a given system and is expected to be observed in biological and societal models. Beyond the definition of this new notion, our work will show its applicability, and propagation, in the so-called Choose the Leader model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Malaria is one of the most common mosquito-borne diseases widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, causing thousands of deaths every year in the world. In a previous paper, we formulated an age-structured model containing three structural variables: (i) the chronological age of human and mosquito populations, (ii) the time since they are infected, and (iii) humans waning immunity (i.e. the progressive loss of protective antibodies after recovery). In the present paper, we expand the analysis of this age-structured model and focus on the derivation of entomological and epidemiological results commonly used in the literature, following the works of Smith and McKenzie. We generalize their results to the age-structured case. In order to quantify the impact of neglecting structuring variables such as chronological age, we assigned values from the literature to our model parameters. While some parameters values are readily accessible from the literature, at least those about the human population, the parameters concerning mosquitoes are less commonly documented and the values of a number of them (e.g. mosquito survival in the presence or in absence of infection) can be discussed extensively.</description>

      <title>Higher-order propagation of chaos in $L^2$ for interacting diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study diffusions with bounded pairwise interaction. We show for the first time propagation of chaos on arbitrary time horizons in a stronger $L^2$-based distance, as opposed to the usual Wasserstein or relative entropy distances. The estimate is based on iterating inequalities derived from the BBGKY hierarchy and does not follow directly from bounds on the full $N$-particle density. This argument gives the optimal rate in $N$, showing the distance between the $j$-particle marginal density and the tensor product of the mean-field limit is $O(N^{-1})$. We use cluster expansions to give perturbative higher-order corrections to the mean-field limit. For an arbitrary order $i$, these provide ``low-dimensional'' approximations to the $j$-particle marginal density with error $O(N^{-(i+1)})$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenization and hydrodynamic limit of non-gradient exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the non-gradient exclusion process, we prove the quantitative homogenization in the approximation of the diffusion matrix and the conductivity by local functions. The proof relies on the renormalization approach developed by Armstrong, Kuusi, Mourrat, and Smart, while the new challenge here is the hard core constraint of particle number on every site. Therefore, a coarse-grained method is proposed to lift the configuration to a larger space without exclusion, and a gradient coupling between two systems is applied to capture the spatial cancellation. We then strengthen the convergence rate to be uniform concerning the density and integrate it into the work by Funaki, Uchiyama, and Yau [IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 77 (1996), pp. 1-40.] to yield a quantitative hydrodynamic limit. Our new approach avoids showing the characterization of closed forms and provides stronger results. The extension is discussed for the model in the presence of disorder on the bonds.</description>
