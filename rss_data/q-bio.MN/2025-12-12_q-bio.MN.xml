      <title>Tracking large chemical reaction networks and rare events by neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks are widely used to model stochastic dynamics in chemical kinetics, systems biology and epidemiology. Solving the chemical master equation that governs these systems poses a significant challenge due to the large state space exponentially growing with system sizes. The development of autoregressive neural networks offers a flexible framework for this problem; however, its efficiency is limited especially for high-dimensional systems and in scenarios with rare events. Here, we push the frontier of neural-network approach by exploiting faster optimizations such as natural gradient descent and time-dependent variational principle, achieving a 5- to 22-fold speedup, and by leveraging enhanced-sampling strategies to capture rare events. We demonstrate reduced computational cost and higher accuracy over the previous neural-network method in challenging reaction networks, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade network, the hitherto largest biological network handled by the previous approaches of solving the chemical master equation. We further apply the approach to spatially extended reaction-diffusion systems, the Schl\"ogl model with rare events, on two-dimensional lattices, beyond the recent tensor-network approach that handles one-dimensional lattices. The present approach thus enables efficient modeling of chemical reaction networks in general.</description>

      <title>Why a chloroplast needs its own genome tethered to the thylakoid membrane - Co-location for Redox Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chloroplast is a subcellular organelle of photosynthesis in plant and algal cells. A chloroplast genome encodes proteins of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and ribosomal proteins required to express them. Chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic proteins are mostly intrinsic to the chloroplast thylakoid membrane where they drive vectorial electron and proton transport. There they function in close contact with proteins whose precursors are encoded in the cell nucleus for cytosolic synthesis, subsequent processing, and import into the chloroplast. The protein complexes of photosynthetic electron transport thus contain subunits with one of two quite different sites of synthesis. If most chloroplast proteins result from expression of nuclear genes then why not all? What selective pressure accounts for the persistence of the chloroplast genome? One proposal is that photosynthetic electron transport itself governs expression of genes for its own components: co-location of chloroplast genes with their gene products allows redox regulation of gene expression, thereby resulting in self-adjustment of protein stoichiometry in response to environmental change. This hypothesis posits Co-Location for Redox Regulation, termed CoRR, as the primary reason for the retention of genomes in both photosynthetic chloroplasts and respiring mitochondria. I propose that redox regulation affects all stages of chloroplast gene expression and that this integrated control is mediated by a chloroplast mesosome or nucleoid - a structure that tethers chloroplast DNA to the thylakoid.</description>

      <title>Saturation-Based Atom Provenance Tracing in Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom tracing is essential for understanding the fate of labeled atoms in biochemical reaction networks, yet existing computational methods either simplify label correlations or suffer from combinatorial explosion. We introduce a saturation-based framework for enumerating labeling patterns that directly operates on atom-atom maps without requiring flux data or experimental measurements. The approach models reaction semantics using Kleisli morphisms in the powerset monad, allowing for compositional propagation of atom provenance through reaction networks. By iteratively saturating all possible educt combinations of reaction rules, the method exhaustively enumerates labeled molecular configurations, including multiplicities and reuse. Allowing arbitrary initial labeling patterns - including identical or distinct labels - the method expands only isotopomers reachable from these inputs, keeping the configuration space as small as necessary and avoids the full combinatorial growth characteristic of previous approaches. In principle, even every atom could carry a distinct identifier (e.g., tracing all carbon atoms individually), illustrating the generality of the framework beyond practical experimental limitations. The resulting template instance hypergraph captures the complete flow of atoms between compounds and supports projections tailored to experimental targets. Customizable labeling sets significantly reduce generated network sizes, providing efficient and exact atom traces focused on specific compounds or available isotopes. Applications to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glycolytic pathways demonstrate that the method fully automatically reproduces known labeling patterns and discovers steady-state labeling behavior. The framework offers a scalable, mechanistically transparent, and generalizable foundation for isotopomer modeling and experiment design.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping computational and network biology by enabling new approaches to decode cellular communication networks. We introduce Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs), a novel framework that models cellular signaling as a specialized molecular language, where signaling molecules function as tokens, protein interactions define syntax, and functional consequences constitute semantics. HMLMs employ a transformer-based architecture adapted to accommodate graph-structured signaling networks through information transducers, mathematical entities that capture how molecules receive, process, and transmit signals. The architecture integrates multi-modal data sources across molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention mechanisms and scale-bridging operators that enable information flow across biological hierarchies. Applied to a complex network of cardiac fibroblast signaling, HMLMs outperformed traditional approaches in temporal dynamics prediction, particularly under sparse sampling conditions. Attention-based analysis revealed biologically meaningful crosstalk patterns, including previously uncharacterized interactions between signaling pathways. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs establish a foundation for biology-oriented large language models (LLMs) that could be pre-trained on comprehensive pathway datasets and applied across diverse signaling systems and tissues, advancing precision medicine and therapeutic discovery.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis for a Class of Stochastic Copolymerization Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence, and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex models in the future.</description>
