      <title>Combinatorics of higher-categorical diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a book on higher-categorical diagrams, including pasting diagrams. It aims to provide a thorough and modern reference on the subject, collecting, revisiting and expanding results scattered across the literature, informed by recent advances and practical experience with higher-dimensional diagram rewriting.
  We approach the subject as a kind of directed combinatorial topology: a diagram is a map from a "directed cell complex", encoded combinatorially as a face poset together with orientation data. Unlike previous expositions, we adopt from the beginning a functorial viewpoint, focussing on morphisms and categorical constructions. We do not tie ourselves to a specific model of higher categories, and instead treat diagrams as independent combinatorial structures that admit functorial interpretations in various contexts.
  Topics covered include the theory of layerings of diagrams; acyclicity properties and their consequences; constructions including Gray products, suspensions, and joins; special shapes such as globes, oriented simplices, cubes, and positive opetopes; the interpretation of diagrams in strict omega-categories and their geometric realisation as simplicial and CW complexes; and Steiner's theory of directed chain complexes.</description>

      <title>Length of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of length of triangulated categories, and we compute the length of the derived category ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$ of a smooth projective curve $C$ and classify all finite length thick subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$. We also discuss the length of (1) derived categories of finite dimensional representations of ADE quivers, (2) derived categories of some singular varieties and (3) Krah's phantom subcategories.</description>

      <title>Reflexive graph lenses in univalent foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Martin-L\"of's identity types provide a generic (albeit opaque) notion of identification or "equality" between any two elements of the same type, embodied in a canonical reflexive graph structure $(=_A, \mathbf{refl})$ on any type $A$. The miracle of Voevodsky's univalence principle is that it ensures, for essentially any naturally occurring structure in mathematics, that this the resultant notion of identification is equivalent to the type of isomorphisms in the category of such structures. Characterisations of this kind are not automatic and must be established one-by-one; to this end, several authors have employed reflexive graphs and displayed reflexive graphs to organise the characterisation of identity types.
  We contribute reflexive graph lenses, a new family of intermediate abstractions lying between families of reflexive graphs and displayed reflexive graphs that simplifies the characterisation of identity types for complex structures. Every reflexive graph lens gives rise to a (more complicated) displayed reflexive graph, and our experience suggests that many naturally occurring displayed reflexive graphs arise in this way. Evidence for the utility of reflexive graph lenses is given by means of several case studies, including the theory of reflexive graphs itself as well as that of polynomial type operators. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence between the type of reflexive graph fibrations and the type of univalent reflexive graph lenses.</description>

      <title>The Sup Connective in IMALL: A Categorical Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a proof language for intuitionistic multiplicative additive linear logic, incorporating the sup connective that introduces additive pairs with a probabilistic elimination, and sum and scalar products within the proof-terms. We provide an abstract characterization of the language, revealing that any symmetric monoidal closed category with biproducts and a monomorphism from the semiring of scalars to the semiring Hom(I,I) is suitable for the job. Leveraging the binary biproducts, we define a weighted codiagonal map at the heart of the sup connective.</description>

      <title>Surprising occurrences of order structures in mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order and symmetry are main structural principles in mathematics. We give five examples where on the face of it order is not apparent, but deeper investigations reveal that they are governed by order structures. These examples are finite topologies, associative algebras, subgroups of matrix groups, ideals in polynomial rings, and classes of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Complete equational theories for classical and quantum Gaussian relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give generators and relations for the hypergraph props of Gaussian relations and positive affine Lagrangian relations. The former extends Gaussian probabilistic processes by completely-uninformative priors, and the latter extends Gaussian quantum mechanics with infinitely-squeezed states. These presentations are given by adding a generator to the presentation of real affine relations and of real affine Lagrangian relations which freely codiscards effects, as well as certain rotations.
  The presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations provides a rigorous justification for many common yet informal calculations in the quantum physics literature involving infinite-squeezing. Our presentation naturally extends Menicucci et al.'s graph-theoretic representation of Gaussian quantum states with a representation for Gaussian transformations. Using this graphical calculus, we also give a graphical proof of Braunstein and Kimble's continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol. We also interpret the LOv-calculus, a diagrammatic calculus for reasoning about passive linear-optical quantum circuits in our graphical calculus. Moreover, we show how our presentation allows for additional optical operations such as active squeezing.</description>
