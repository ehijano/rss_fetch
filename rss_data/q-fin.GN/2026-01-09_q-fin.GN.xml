      <title>Technology Adoption and Network Externalities in Financial Systems: A Spatial-Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for analyzing technology adoption in financial networks that incorporates spatial spillovers, network externalities, and their interaction. The framework characterizes adoption dynamics through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative adoption pressure along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the Adoption Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of technology leadership that captures the ratio of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a localized shock. A Levy jump-diffusion extension with state-dependent jump intensity captures critical mass dynamics: below threshold, adoption evolves through gradual diffusion; above threshold, cascade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete jumps. Applying the framework to SWIFT gpi adoption among 17 Global Systemically Important Banks, I find strong support for the two-regime characterization. Network-central banks adopt significantly earlier ($\rho = -0.69$, $p = 0.002$), and pre-threshold adopters have significantly higher amplification factors than post-threshold adopters (11.81 versus 7.83, $p = 0.010$). Founding members, representing 29 percent of banks, account for 39 percent of total system amplification -- sufficient to trigger cascade dynamics. Controlling for firm size and network position, CEO age delays adoption by 11-15 days per year.</description>

      <title>The relationship between general equilibrium models with infinite-lived agents and overlapping generations models, and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a two-cycle equilibrium in a general equilibrium model with infinitely-lived agents constitutes an equilibrium in an overlapping generations (OLG) model. Conversely, an equilibrium in an OLG model that satisfies additional conditions is part of an equilibrium in a general equilibrium model with infinitely-lived agents. Note that our models consisting of three assets (physical capital, Lucas' tree, and fiat money) cover both exchange and production economies. Applying this result, we demonstrate that equilibrium indeterminacy and rational asset price bubbles may arise not only in OLG models but also in models with infinitely-lived agents.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Information without Transitivity and Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I relax the standard assumptions of transitivity and partition structure in economic models of information to formalize vague knowledge: non-transitive indistinguishability over states. I show that vague knowledge, while failing to partition the state space, remains informative by distinguishing some states from others. Moreover, it can only be faithfully expressed through vague communication with blurred boundaries. My results provide microfoundations for the prevalence of natural language communication and qualitative reasoning in the real world, where knowledge is often vague.</description>
