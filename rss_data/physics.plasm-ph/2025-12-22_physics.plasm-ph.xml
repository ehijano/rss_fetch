      <title>Asymptotic state of nonlinear Landau damping in one-dimensional plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the asymptotic state of nonlinear Landau damping in one-dimensional plasma has been examined using a quasi-linear model and a second-order symplectic integrator. The dispersion relation of the plateau distribution function for the steady-state solution of the quasi-linear mode is extended to the complex plane and compared with the nonlinear simulation. We determine that the asymptotic state of the collisionless plasma is a multi-wave BGK structure. This structure is characterized by multiple vortices in phase space, which correspond to distinct peaks in the frequency-wavenumber ({\omega}, k) spectrum of the electric field</description>

      <title>Influence of plasma shaping on the parity of core-localized toroidal Alfv\'{e}n eigenmode in an advanced tokamak configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toroidal Alfv\'{e}n eigenmodes (TAEs) and energetic particle modes (EPMs) can both be excited by energetic particles from auxiliary heating and fusion-born alpha particles in a tokamak. Using the hybrid kinetic-MHD model implemented in the NIMROD code, the excitation of these modes and their properties are investigated in an advanced tokamak configuration with reversed magnetic shear in the core region. The dominant TAE/EPM is found to exhibit odd parity with an anti-ballooning structure when the plasma has elongated, non-circular two-dimensional shaping. As the plasma shaping becomes more circular with reduced elongation, the mode parity undergoes a transition to even parity accompanied by a ballooning structure. These results may help explain the dominant parity of TAE/EPMs observed in advanced tokamak configurations with different plasma shaping.</description>

      <title>H-mode transition in the TJ-II stellarator plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first H-mode transitions were observed in TJ-II plasmas in 2008, an extensive experimental effort has been done aiming a better physics understanding of confinement transitions. In this paper, an overview of the main findings related to the L-H transition in TJ-II is presented including how the radial electric field is driven, which are the possible mechanisms for turbulence suppression, and what are the related temporal and spatial scales which can impact the transition. The trigger of the L-H transition in TJ-II plasmas is found to be more correlated with the development of fluctuating $E\times B$ flows than with steady-state $E_r$ effects, pointing to the role played by zonal flows in mediating the transition. Experimental evidence supporting the predator-prey relationship between turbulence and flows as the basis for the L-H transition, found for the first time in TJ-II, reinforces this conclusion. Besides, the reduction in the turbulent transport at the transition is detected at the barrier region but also in a wider radial range with weak or even zero $E\times B$ flow shear, what points to other mechanisms beyond the turbulence suppression by local sheared flows.</description>

      <title>Characteristic features of the resonant trident process in the field of a strong monochromatic electromagnetic wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characteristic features of the resonant trident process (Oleinik resonances) have been theoretically studied in a wide range of frequencies and intensities of a circularly polarized strong electromagnetic wave. The resonant trident process is defined by two characteristic quantum energies: the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Compton effect and the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. These characteristic energies depend significantly on the frequency and intensity of the wave, as well as on the angle between the momenta of the initial electrons and the electromagnetic wave. The resonant trident process is effective when the energy of the initial electrons is greater than or on the order of magnitude of the corresponding characteristic energies. It is shown that quantum entanglement of final particles takes place in this resonant process. An important aspect of the resonant trident process is the equality of the energies of the electron and positron pairs. Analytical expressions for the differential rates of the resonant trident process on the energy of final particles are obtained. The corresponding analytical expressions for full rates have also been obtained. It is shown that the rate data of the resonant trident process in the field of optical and X-ray wave frequencies significantly exceed the corresponding rate of the non-resonant trident process. Results obtained can be used in experiments at leading laser centers, as well as to explain QED processes in strong X-ray fields near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Doppler-induced continuous spectral broadening of ultraviolet lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a compact scheme based on ultrafast-rotating phase plates (URPPs) to achieve continuous spectral broadening of ultraviolet lasers. The rapid rotation elements behave as a random oscillator which induces Doppler frequency shift into the ultraviolet lasers. As an example, for a disk-shaped phase plate, with the beam acting on the edge at a radius of 10 cm, a rotation frequency of 1 kHz, and a phase-element size of 10 nm, the continuous spectral broadening reaches 0.07%. Further increasing the rotation speed or reducing the phase-element can lead to greater spectral broadening. When multiple URPPs are arranged in series, the superimposed spatiotemporal modulation further enhances the continuous spectral broadening and achieves more effective speckle smoothing. The scheme is applicable to broadening the independent spectrum of optical frequency combs as well as to the mitigation of laser-plasma instabilities in inertial fusion energy.</description>

      <title>Water activation using Ar-H$_2$ atmospheric pressure plasma jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether for materials processing or medical applications, the use of atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) has emerged as a relevant alternative to conventional methods. Within the APPJs research field, the search for innovation aims not only to solve existing problems but also to explore novel options for generating plasma jets and find new possible applications. In this work, the properties of Ar-H$_2$ APPJs generated using two plasma sources that differ in the frequency, amplitude, and waveform of the generated voltage signal were studied through electrical, thermal, and optical characterization. The discharge parameters were analyzed as a function of the H$_2$ content in the gas mixture, with this parameter varying from 0\% to 3.5\%. Optical emission spectroscopy revealed that the same reactive species were produced for both plasma sources, except nitric oxide (NO), which was observed only for the source operated at a higher frequency (PS #1). Applications for water activation were performed without H$_2$ and with 3.5% H$_2$ in the gas mixture. The results of water treatment revealed that ammonia is also produced when H$_2$ is added to the working gas. This finding suggests that the water treated by a Ar-H$_2$ plasma jet can be an attractive option for use in agriculture.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Laser-Wakefield Acceleration via Spectral Pulse Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of spectral pulse shaping of the laser driver on the performance of channel-guided, laser-plasma accelerators. The study was carried out with the assistance of Bayesian optimization using particle-in-cell simulations. We used a realistic plasma profile based on a novel optical-field-ionized channel technique with ionization injection and low on-axis plasma densities to maximize the energy gain of the electron bunch trailing the laser. Spectral shaping allows us to modify the temporal profile of the laser driver while keeping the laser energy constant, affecting the acceleration and injection processes. Given the complexity and breadth of the parameter space in question, we used numerical optimization to identify high performers. In particular, we found laser profiles with additional spectral content that, when used with optimal plasma channel parameters, result in charge content an order of magnitude higher than the baseline Gaussian case while also increasing the mean energy of the electron bunch.</description>
