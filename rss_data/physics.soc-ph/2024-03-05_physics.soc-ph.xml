      <title>Quantum Readiness in Healthcare and Public Health: Building a Quantum Literate Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies, including quantum computing, cryptography, and sensing, among others, are set to revolutionize sectors ranging from materials science to drug discovery. Despite their significant potential, the implications for public health have been largely overlooked, highlighting a critical gap in recognition and preparation. This oversight necessitates immediate action, as public health remains largely unaware of quantum technologies as a tool for advancement. The application of quantum principles to epidemiology and health informatics, termed quantum health epidemiology and quantum health informatics, has the potential to radically transform disease surveillance, prediction, modeling, and analysis of health data. However, there is a notable lack of quantum expertise within the public health workforce and educational pipelines. This gap underscores the urgent need for the development of quantum literacy among public health practitioners, leaders, and students to leverage emerging opportunities while addressing risks and ethical considerations. Innovative teaching methods, such as interactive simulations, games, visual models, and other tailored platforms, offer viable solutions for bridging knowledge gaps without the need for advanced physics or mathematics. However, the opportunity to adapt is fleeting as the quantum era in healthcare looms near. It is imperative that public health urgently focuses on updating its educational approaches, workforce strategies, data governance, and organizational culture to proactively meet the challenges of quantum disruption thereby becoming quantum ready.</description>

      <title>Towards localized accuracy assessment of remote-sensing derived built-up land layers across the rural-urban continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy assessment of remote-sensing derived built-up land data represents a specific case of binary map comparison, where class imbalance varies considerably across rural-urban trajectories. Thus, local accuracy characterization of such datasets requires specific strategies that are robust to low sample sizes and different levels of class imbalance. Herein, we examine the suitability of commonly used spatial agreement measures for their localized accuracy characterization of built-up land layers across the rural-urban continuum, using the Global Human Settlement Layer and a reference database of built-up land derived from cadastral and building footprint data.</description>

      <title>The evolution of pluralistic ignorance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pluralistic ignorance is a social-psychological phenomenon characterized by individuals privately maintaining beliefs or opinions that diverge from what they perceive to be the prevailing norm within a group or society. Typical models are based on opinion dynamics involving both private and public states, where agents' binary states undergo changes influenced by social pressure. However, these models overlook a crucial aspect of pluralistic ignorance: if the absence of behavioral expression matches the normative status of the behavior, social pressure exerted by the initial group configuration is enough to induce pluralistic ignorance. Here, we show that pluralistic ignorance is maintained if imitation of others is not too frequent and the social influence of the initial minority is high. Interestingly, the individuals are able to overcome the pluralistic ignorance by the end of interactions, yet it resurfaces at the outset of each subsequent group interaction. However, if the likelihood of individuals imitating others becomes excessively high, pluralistic ignorance completely dissipates in an undesirable manner: individuals internalize the dysfunctional behavior. We also show that, if memory is added to the internalization process, pluralistic ignorance reaches high levels only for intermediate imitation rates.</description>

      <title>Geometry-free renormalization of directed networks: scale-invariance and reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has tried to extend the concept of renormalization, which is naturally defined for geometric objects, to more general networks with arbitrary topology. The current attempts do not naturally apply to directed networks, for instance because they are based on the identification of (necessarily symmetric) inter-node distances arising from geometric embeddings or on the definition of Hermitian Laplacian operators requiring symmetric adjacency matrices in spectral approaches. Here we show that the Scale-Invariant Model, recently proposed as an approach to consistently model undirected networks at arbitrary (and possibly multi-scale) resolution levels, can be extended coherently to directed networks without the requirement of an embedding geometry or Laplacian structure. Moreover, it can account for nontrivial reciprocity, i.e. the empirically well-documented tendency of links to occur in mutual pairs more or less often than predicted by chance. After deriving the renormalization rules for networks with arbitrary reciprocity, we consider various examples. In particular we propose the first multiscale model of the international trade network with nontrivial reciprocity and an annealed model where positive reciprocity emerges spontaneously from coarse-graining. In the latter case, the renormalization process defines a group, not only a semigroup, and therefore allows to fine-grain networks to arbitrarily small scales. These results strengthen the notion that network renormalization can be defined in a much more general way than required by geometric or spectral approaches, because it needs only node-specific (metric-free) features and can coexist with the asymmetry of directed networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing social cohesion with cooperative bots in societies of greedy, mobile individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing collective crises in social development necessitates a strong level of social cohesion, characterized by cooperation and close social connections. However, this cohesion is often challenged by selfish behaviors. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the dynamic of human-machine hybrid interactions introduces new complexities in fostering social cohesion. This study investigates the role of bots in influencing social cohesion within these hybrid interactions, aiming to identify strategies to enhance cohesion amidst human-bot interactions. By analyzing a hybrid population of individuals and simple cooperative bots, we find that bots can indeed promote social cohesion by disrupting frozen states in individual migrations and encouraging collective movement. However, challenges such as random bot exploration and the presence of defective bots pose risks to cohesion, underscoring the importance of carefully designed bot behaviors. Our findings illuminate the potential of simple bots to support societal self-organization and offer critical insights into enhancing social cohesion in the era of human-machine collaboration.</description>

      <title>Modeling of obstacle avoidance by a dense crowd as a Mean-Field Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use a minimal model based on Mean-Field Games (a mathematical framework apt to describe situations where a large number of agents compete strategically) to simulate the scenario where a static dense human crowd is crossed by a cylindrical intruder. After a brief explanation of the mathematics behind it, we compare our model directly against the empirical data collected during a controlled experiment replicating the aforementioned situation. We then summarize the features that make the model adhere so well to the experiment and clarify the anticipation time in this framework.</description>

      <title>Impact of Diffusion on synchronization pattern of epidemics in nonidentical metapopulation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a prior study, a novel deterministic compartmental model known as the SEIHRK model was introduced, shedding light on the pivotal role of test kits as an intervention strategy for mitigating epidemics. Particularly in heterogeneous networks, it was empirically demonstrated that strategically distributing a limited number of test kits among nodes with higher degrees substantially diminishes the outbreak size. The network's dynamics were explored under varying values of infection rate. In this research, we expand upon these findings to investigate the influence of migration on infection dynamics within distinct communities of the network. Notably, we observe that nodes equipped with test kits and those without tend to segregate into two separate clusters when coupling strength is low, but beyond a critical threshold coupling coefficient, they coalesce into a unified cluster. Building on this clustering phenomenon, we develop a reduced equation model and rigorously validate its accuracy through comprehensive simulations. We show that this property is observed in both complete and random graphs.</description>

      <title>Solving Jigsaw Puzzles using Iterative Random Sampling: Parallels with Development of Skill Mastery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skill mastery is a priority for success in all fields. We present a parallel between the development of skill mastery and the process of solving jigsaw puzzles. We show that iterative random sampling solves jigsaw puzzles in two phases: a lag phase that is characterized by little change and occupies the majority of the time, and a growth phase that marks rapid and imminent puzzle completion. Changes in the proportions of the number of single pieces and larger pieces can be overlaid on the timeline and progression of skill mastery. An emphasis is placed on the development of connections between pieces, which serves as an indicator of increasing puzzle completion and increasing skill mastery. Our manuscript provides a straightforward visual of skill mastery in the context of a common recreational activity.</description>

      <title>Pattern-detection in the global automotive industry: a manufacturer-supplier-product network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Production networks arise from supply and customer relations among firms. These systems are gaining growing attention as a consequence of disruptions due to natural or man-made disasters that happened in the last years, such as the Covid-19 pandemic or the Russia-Ukraine war. However, data constraints force the few, available studies to consider only country-specific production networks. In order to fully capture the cross-country structure of modern supply chains, here we focus on the global automotive industry as represented by the MarkLines Automotive dataset. After representing this data as a network of manufacturers, suppliers, and products, we perform a pattern-detection exercise using a statistically grounded validation technique based on the maximum entropy principle. We reveal the presence of a significantly large number of V-shaped and square-shaped motifs, indicating that manufacturing firms compete and are seldom engaged in a buyer-supplier relationship, while they typically have many suppliers in common. Interestingly, generalist and specialist suppliers coexist in the network. Additionally, we unveil the presence of geographical patterns, with manufacturers clustering around groups of suppliers; for instance, Chinese firms constitute a disconnected community, likely an effect of the protectionist policies promoted by the Chinese government. We also show the tendency of suppliers to organize their production by targeting specific functional modules of a vehicle. Besides shedding light on the self-organising principles shaping production networks, our findings open up the possibility of designing realistic generative models of supply chains, to be used for testing the resilience of the interconnected global economy.</description>

      <title>The Face of Populism: Examining Differences in Facial Emotional Expressions of Political Leaders Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online media has revolutionized the way political information is disseminated and consumed on a global scale, and this shift has compelled political figures to adopt new strategies of capturing and retaining voter attention. These strategies often rely on emotional persuasion and appeal, and as visual content becomes increasingly prevalent in virtual space, much of political communication too has come to be marked by evocative video content and imagery. The present paper offers a novel approach to analyzing material of this kind. We apply a deep-learning-based computer-vision algorithm to a sample of 220 YouTube videos depicting political leaders from 15 different countries, which is based on an existing trained convolutional neural network architecture provided by the Python library fer. The algorithm returns emotion scores representing the relative presence of 6 emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and a neutral expression for each frame of the processed YouTube video. We observe statistically significant differences in the average score of expressed negative emotions between groups of leaders with varying degrees of populist rhetoric as defined by the Global Party Survey (GPS), indicating that populist leaders tend to express negative emotions to a greater extent during their public performance than their non-populist counterparts. Overall, our contribution provides insight into the characteristics of visual self-representation among political leaders, as well as an open-source workflow for further computational studies of their non-verbal communication.</description>
