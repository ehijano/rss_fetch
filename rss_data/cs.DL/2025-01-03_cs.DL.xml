      <title>Quantifying the Dynamics of Harm Caused by Retracted Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite enormous efforts devoted to understand the characteristics and impacts of retracted papers, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of their harm and the dynamics of its propagation. Here, we propose a citation-based framework to quantify the harm caused by retracted papers, aiming to uncover why their harm persists and spreads so widely. We uncover an ``attention escape'' mechanism, wherein retracted papers postpone significant harm, more prominently affect indirectly citing papers, and inflict greater harm on citations in journals with an impact factor less than $10$. This mechanism allows retracted papers to inflict harm outside the attention of authors and publishers, thereby evading their intervention. This study deepens understanding of the harm caused by retracted papers, emphasizes the need to activate and enhance the attention of authors and publishers, and offers new insights and a foundation for strategies to mitigate their harm and prevent its spread.</description>

      <title>Who Gets Recommended? Investigating Gender, Race, and Country Disparities in Paper Recommendations from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of several representative large models in the tasks of literature recommendation and explores potential biases in research exposure. The results indicate that not only LLMs' overall recommendation accuracy remains limited but also the models tend to recommend literature with greater citation counts, later publication date, and larger author teams. Yet, in scholar recommendation tasks, there is no evidence that LLMs disproportionately recommend male, white, or developed-country authors, contrasting with patterns of known human biases.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Driven Database for Thermoelectric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials provide a sustainable way to convert waste heat into electricity. However, data-driven discovery and optimization of these materials are challenging because of a lack of a reliable database. Here we developed a comprehensive database of 7,123 thermoelectric compounds, containing key information such as chemical composition, structural detail, seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivity, power factor, and figure of merit (ZT). We used the GPTArticleExtractor workflow, powered by large language models (LLM), to extract and curate data automatically from the scientific literature published in Elsevier journals. This process enabled the creation of a structured database that addresses the challenges of manual data collection. The open access database could stimulate data-driven research and advance thermoelectric material analysis and discovery.</description>

      <title>Navigating Knowledge: Patterns and Insights from Wikipedia Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Web has drastically simplified our access to knowledge and learning, and fact-checking online resources has become a part of our daily routine. Studying online knowledge consumption is thus critical for understanding human behavior and informing the design of future platforms. In this Chapter, we approach this subject by describing the navigation patterns of the readers of Wikipedia, the world's largest platform for open knowledge. We provide a comprehensive overview of what is known about the three steps that characterize navigation on Wikipedia: (1) how readers reach the platform, (2) how readers navigate the platform, and (3) how readers leave the platform. Finally, we discuss open problems and opportunities for future research in this field.</description>
