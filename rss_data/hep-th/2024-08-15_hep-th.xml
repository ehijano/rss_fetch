      <title>Diving inside holographic metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational dual of a fermionic field theory at finite temperature and charge density in two spatial dimensions, subject to a deformation by a relevant scalar operator. This makes a $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell system coupled to a free fermion fluid, known as an electron cloud, undergo a holographic renormalization group flow. The inner (Cauchy) horizon is destroyed and the near-singularity metric instead adopts the form of a positive-$p_t$ Kasner cosmology, signaling the collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge. Previous studies have suggested that this collapse hinders direct probing of the singularity. Nonetheless, we propose and compute several CFT observables that characterize the interior and near-singularity geometries. These include the thermal $a$-function, which decays with a specific power of $p_t$ as nearly all CFT degrees of freedom are integrated out, and two-point correlators for neutral and charged operators, with the latter directly probing the singularity despite the positive-$p_t$. We also calculate characteristic velocities related to entanglement and complexity growth in the time-evolved thermofield double state, as well as the butterfly effect indicative of operator spreading. Notably, the deformed electron cloud features a Lifshitz IR fixed point and an additional Kasner trans-IR fixed point, absent in neutral RG flows.</description>

      <title>An exercise in Color-Dual Cut Tiling: $\mathcal{N}=8$ Supergravity from Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BCJ duality between color and kinematics brings two advantages to calculating multi-loop scattering amplitudes. First the number of ordered cuts that need to be performed to fix the integrand to a gauge theory is minimal -- reducing the factorially-growing number of diagrams to a single-digit basis in all known cases. Second is the trivial generation of related gravitational amplitudes from gauge theory amplitudes via double-copy. Mounting evidence suggests there are some cases where no local color-dual representations exist, even when the semi-classical theory is color-dual. Can we still simplify the calculations without making the duality manifest at the level of the integrand? Here we take a non-trivial step in this direction by showing that the satisfaction of tree-level BCJ relations is sufficient to dramatically reduce the number of explicit cuts that must be performed, even when the loop-level relations are not explicitly satisfied. We introduce an agglomerative algorithm, color-dual cut tiling, that identifies and builds the entire integrand from the simplest on-shell conditions applied to a seed of off-shell integrand information. Specifically, we demonstrate that for two-to-two scattering at three loops in the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory there is sufficient information contained in planar cuts -- completely determined by positivity constraints -- to generate all of the non-planar sector. Additionally, we make use of the generalized double copy to generate a representation of maximally supersymmetric gravity as a functional of the planar SYM input. We discuss how the process might generalize, and then close by commenting on the applicability of this method for additional cases of interest where performing explicit unitarity cuts is expensive.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons theories with defects, Rogers-Ramanujan type functions and eta-products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the line defect half-indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons (CS) theories with (special)unitary, symplectic, orthogonal and exceptional gauge groups. We find that they have several beautiful infinite product $q$-series expressions in terms of Ramanujan's general theta function. For the theories with fundamental chiral multiplets, the pairs of the Neumann half-indices and one-point functions of the fundamental Wilson lines form a basis for the line defect indices in terms of the Rogers-Ramanujan type functions. Furthermore, the theories with an adjoint chiral admit the expressions as the eta-products. In particular, for the $SU(N)_{-2N}$ CS theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the BPS boundary local operators and the $N$-core partitions.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap 2024: Lectures on "The algebraic approach: when, how, and why?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes formed the basis of a mini-course on algebraic quantum field theory presented at the Bootstrap 2024 conference in Madrid. The goal of the notes is to explain the merits of algebraic quantum field theory to a broad audience, and to explore (i) how to know when a particular question calls for an algebraic answer, (ii) how to apply the tools of algebraic QFT to such a problem, and (iii) why quantum field theorists of all stripes stand to benefit from a basic knowledge of algebraic quantum fields. The first lecture focuses on the big-picture motivation behind the algebraic approach to quantum field theory, and an elaboration of its basic tools. Subsequent lectures explain some of the modern achievements of the algebraic toolkit, including an argument for the averaged null energy condition and an enhanced understanding of entropy for semiclassical black holes.</description>

      <title>Perturbing a quantum black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the analytic structure of correlators in the field theory dual to the quantum Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (qBTZ) black hole, a braneworld model incorporating exact backreaction from quantum conformal matter. We first compute the quasi-normal mode (QNM) spectrum of operators with dimension $\Delta$ and spin $s=0,\pm 1/2$. The leading QNMs and their overtones display qualitatively different behavior depending on the branch of qBTZ solution; branch 1 is a conical singularity dressed with a horizon while branch 2 is a quantum-corrected BTZ black hole. Hence the relaxation of probe matter distinguishes the type of singularity cloaked by the horizon. We then turn to pole-skipping locations where Green's functions are not unique. At these points, frequency is proportional to temperature, but momentum exhibits complex temperature dependence due to quantum effects. Under the assumption that the pole-skipping point closest to the origin reflects quantum chaos, we infer the likely behavior of the quantum Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity in the dual theory. Finally, we examine pole collisions in complex momentum space, showing that quantum corrections imprint a unique signature on the analytic structure of the poles in retarded Green's functions, resulting in level-crossing phenomena that differ notably from the level-touching phenomena in the uncorrected BTZ geometry.</description>

      <title>Spectral Projections for Density Matrices in Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral projection of density matrices in quantum field theory. With appropriate regularization, the spectral projectors of density matrices are expected to be well-defined. These projectors can be obtained using the Riesz projection formula, which allows us to compute both the density of eigenvalues and the expectation values of local operators in the projected states. We find that there are universal divergent terms in the expectation value of the stress energy tensor, where the coefficients depend universally on the density of eigenvalues and a function that describes the dependence of eigenvalues on boundary location. Using projection states, we can construct a series of new states in quantum field theories and discuss their general properties, focusing on the holographic aspects. We observe that quantum fluctuations are suppressed in the semiclassical limit. We also demonstrate that the fixed area state, previously constructed using gravitational path integrals, can be constructed by suitably superposition of appromiate amount of projection states. Additionally, we apply spectral projection to non-Hermitian operators, such as transition matrices, to obtain their eigenvalues and densities. Finally, we highlight potential applications of spectral projections, including the construction of new density and transition matrices and the understanding of superpositions of geometric states.</description>

      <title>On geometric bases for {\it quantum} A-polynomials of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple geometric way is suggested to derive the Ward identities in the Chern-Simons theory, also known as quantum $A$- and $C$-polynomials for knots. In quasi-classical limit it is closely related to the well publicized augmentation theory and contact geometry. Quantization allows to present it in much simpler terms, what could make these techniques available to a broader audience. To avoid overloading of the presentation, only the case of the colored Jones polynomial for the trefoil knot is considered, though various generalizations are straightforward. Restriction to solely Jones polynomials (rather than full HOMFLY-PT) is related to a serious simplification, provided by the use of Kauffman calculus. Going beyond looks realistic, however it remains a problem, both challenging and promising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to reliably calculate quantum gravitational corrections to cosmological models using the unique effective action formalism for quantum gravity. Our calculations are model independent and apply to any ultra-violet complete theory of quantum gravity that admit general relativity as a low energy theory. We show that it is important to consider the full effective action to obtain renormalization group invariant solutions. We investigate the validity range of our techniques within simple cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Integrable RG Flows on Topological Defect Lines in 2D Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defect lines (TDLs) in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) are standard examples of generalized symmetries in quantum field theory. Integrable lattice incarnations of these TDLs, such as those provided by spin/anyonic chains, provide a crucial playground to investigate their properties, both analytically and numerically. Here, a family of parameter-dependent integrable lattice models is presented, which realize different TDLs in a given CFT as the parameter is varied. These models are based on the general quantum-inverse scattering construction, and involve inhomogeneities of the spectral parameter. Both defect hamiltonians and (defect) line operators are obtained in closed form. By varying the inhomogeneities, renormalization group flows between different TDLs (such as the Verlinde lines associated with the Virasoro primaries $(1,s)$ and $(s,1)$ in diagonal minimal CFTs) are then studied using different aspects of the Bethe-ansatz as well as ab-initio numerical techniques. Relationships with the anisotropic Kondo model as well as its non-Hermitian version are briefly discussed</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by gauged supergravities, we consider gravitational systems coupled to arbitrary numbers of fluxes and scalar fields. We show that simple ansatze for asymptotically AdS solutions in these systems fully determine the potential for the scalars, and we construct the black hole geometries which generalize the solutions known in gauged supergravities to an arbitrary number of dimensions. We also construct branes and brane intersections supported by an arbitrary number of higher--form fluxes and a correlated number of scalars.</description>

      <title>Weak gauge PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge PDEs generalise AKSZ sigma models to the case of general local gauge theories. Despite being very flexible and invariant these geometrical objects are usually infinite-dimensional and are difficult to define explicitly, just like standard infinitely-prolonged PDEs. We propose a notion of a weak gauge PDE where the nilpotency of the BRST differential is relaxed in a controllable way. In this approach a nontopological local gauge theory can be described in terms of a finite-dimensional geometrical object. Moreover, among such objects one can find a minimal one which is unique in a certain sense. In the case of a Lagrangian system, the respective weak gauge PDE naturally arise from its weak presymplectic formulation. We prove that any weak gauge PDE determines the standard jet-bundle BV formulation of the underlying gauge theory, giving an unambiguous physical interpretation of these objects. The formalism is illustrated by a few examples including the non-Lagrangian self-dual Yang-Mills theory. We also discuss possible applications of the approach to characterisation of those infinite-dimensional gauge PDEs which correspond to local theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A charged particle in a suitably strong magnetic field spirals along the field lines while slowly drifting transversely. This note provides a brief derivation of an effective Lagrangian formulation for the guiding center approximation that captures this dynamics without resolving the gyro motion. It also explains how the effective Lagrangian may, for special magnetic fields, admit a ``quasisymmetry'' which can give rise to a conserved quantity helpful for plasma confinement in fields lacking a geometric isometry. The aim of this note is to offer a pedagogical introduction and some perspectives on this well established subject.</description>

      <title>No Warm Inflation From Sphaleron Heating With a Vanilla Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At finite temperature, the coupling of an axion to non-Abelian gauge fields causes dissipation due to sphaleron heating. This mechanism is ideally suited for realizing warm inflation since it can lead to large thermal friction while preserving the flatness of the potential. We show, however, that requiring standard properties of an axion $-$ in particular a discrete shift symmetry and a potential generated non-perturbatively by instanton effects $-$ excludes the strong regime of warm slow-roll inflation, in which thermal friction dominates. The derivation of this result does not require any phenomenological input. While non-minimal (axion-like) models provide a way out, sphaleron heating with a standard axion is capable of enabling the weak regime of warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Is Lattice Quantum Gravity Asymptotically Safe? Making contact between Causal Dynamical Triangulations and the Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the effective action of the scale factor obtained from lattice quantum gravity (in the form of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)) to the corresponding effective action obtained from the simplest Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) calculation. In this way, we can identify the generic infinite four-volume limit of the lattice theory in the so-called de Sitter phase with the Gaussian fixed-point limit or the IR fixed-point limit obtained by FRG. We also show how to identify a putative UV lattice gravity fixed point. Our Monte Carlo simulations of CDT allow for the existence of such a UV fixed point, although the data precision does not yet provide a proof of its existence. The concept of a correlation length relevant for the lattice gravity fixed points is argued to be different from the concept of correlation lengths encountered in field theories in a fixed spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonians for Free Fermion Chains with Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the half system entanglement Hamiltonians of the ground state of free fermion critical transverse field Ising model with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of defects. In general, we see that these defects introduce non-local terms into the entanglement Hamiltonian with the largest being couplings across the defect that decay with distance. It is also shown that the entanglement Hamiltonian does know of the defect even if the defect is outside of the subsystem. We also discuss what happens when defects are on the boundaries of the subsystem, and in particular, we investigate the behavior as the bond leading into the subsystem is cut. Finally, we examine the non-local behavior of the antiperiodic defect and duality defect, both of which introduce zero modes.</description>

      <title>The Baker-Coon-Romans $N$-point amplitude and an exact field theory limit of the Coon amplitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04130v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $N$-point Coon amplitude discovered first by Baker and Coon in the 1970s and then again independently by Romans in the 1980s. This Baker-Coon-Romans (BCR) amplitude retains several properties of tree-level string amplitudes, namely duality and factorization, with a $q$-deformed version of the string spectrum. Although the formula for the $N$-point BCR amplitude is only valid for ${q &gt; 1}$, the four-point case admits a straightforward extension to all ${q \geq 0}$ which reproduces the usual expression for the four-point Coon amplitude. At five points, there are inconsistencies with factorization when pushing ${q &lt; 1}$. Despite these issues, we find a new relation between the five-point BCR amplitude and Cheung and Remmen's four-point basic hypergeometric amplitude, placing the latter within the broader family of Coon amplitudes. Finally, we compute the $q \to \infty$ limit of the $N$-point BCR amplitudes and discover an exact correspondence between these amplitudes and the field theory amplitudes of a scalar transforming in the adjoint representation of a global symmetry group with an infinite set of non-derivative single-trace interaction terms. This correspondence at $q = \infty$ is the first definitive realization of the Coon amplitude (in any limit) from a field theory described by an explicit Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Scaffolded Gluons and the Combinatorial Origins of Yang-Mills Theory</title>

Abstract: We present a new formulation for Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes in any number of dimensions and at any loop order, based on the same combinatorial and binary-geometric ideas in kinematic space recently used to give an all-order description of Tr $\phi^3$ theory. We propose that in a precise sense the amplitudes for a suitably "stringy" form of these two theories are identical, up to a simple shift of kinematic variables. This connection is made possible by describing the amplitudes for $n$ gluons via a "scalar scaffolding", arising from the scattering of $2n$ colored scalars coming in $n$ distinct pairs of flavors fusing to produce the gluons. Fundamental properties of the "$u$-variables", describing the "binary geometry" for surfaces appearing in the topological expansion, magically guarantee that the kinematically shifted Tr $\phi^3$ amplitudes satisfy the physical properties needed to be interpreted as scaffolded gluons. These include multilinearity, gauge invariance, and factorization on tree- and loop- level gluon cuts. Our "stringy" scaffolded gluon amplitudes coincide with amplitudes in the bosonic string for extra-dimensional gluon polarizations at tree-level, but differ (and are simpler) at loop-level. We provide many checks on our proposal, including matching non-trivial leading singularities through two loops. The simple counting problem underlying the $u$ variables autonomously "knows" about everything needed to convert colored scalar to gluon amplitudes, exposing a striking "discovery" of Yang-Mills amplitudes from elementary combinatorial ideas in kinematic space.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the data-driven holographic transport models without translation symmetry, focusing on the real part of frequency-dependent shear viscosity, $\eta_{\mathrm{re}}(\omega)$. We develop a radial flow equation of the shear response and establish its relation to $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega)$ for a wide class of holographic models. This allows us to determine $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$ of a strongly coupled field theory by the black hole metric and the graviton mass. The latter serves as the bulk dual to the translation symmetry breaking on the boundary. We convert the flow equation to a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE), which is a neural network with continuous depth and produces output through a black-box ODE solver. Testing the Neural ODE on three well-known holographic models without translation symmetry, we demonstrate its ability to accurately learn either the metric or mass when given the other. Additionally, we illustrate that the learned metric can be used to predict the derivative of entanglement entropy $S$ with respect to the size of entangling region $l$.</description>

Abstract: We study closed universes in simple models of two dimensional gravity, such as Jackiw-Teiteilboim (JT) gravity coupled to matter, and a toy topological model that captures the key features of the former. We find there is a stark contrast, as well as some connections, between the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of the theory. We find rich semi-classical physics. However, when non-perturbative effects are included there is a unique closed universe state in each theory. We discuss possible meanings and interpretations of this observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12972v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stokes-Mueller method is used to analyze the scattering of entangled photon pairs in a two-photon system. This study examines the scenario where one of the photons, part of a pair of maximally entangled annihilation photons, undergoes intermediate Compton scattering before both photons are detected using Compton polarimeters. The method also accounts for potential quantum-decoherence effects resulting from Compton scattering. The analysis investigates the scattering behavior in both parallel and perpendicular planes, identifying variations in the modulation factor that affect azimuthal correlations. These variations include increases, decreases, sign changes, or disappearances at certain intermediate scattering angles. This work aims to provide theoretical results that support the testing and verification of predictions made by quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Relational bulk reconstruction from modular flow</title>

Abstract: The entanglement wedge reconstruction paradigm in AdS/CFT states that for a bulk qudit within the entanglement wedge of a boundary subregion $\bar{A}$, operators acting on the bulk qudit can be reconstructed as CFT operators on $\bar{A}$. This naturally fits within the framework of quantum error correction, with the CFT states containing the bulk qudit forming a code protected against the erasure of the boundary subregion $A$. In this paper, we set up and study a framework for relational bulk reconstruction in holography: given two code subspaces both protected against erasure of the boundary region $A$, the goal is to relate the operator reconstructions between the two spaces. To accomplish this, we assume that the two code subspaces are smoothly connected by a one-parameter family of codes all protected against the erasure of $A$, and that the maximally-entangled states on these codes are all full-rank. We argue that such code subspaces can naturally be constructed in holography in a "measurement-based" setting. In this setting, we derive a flow equation for the operator reconstruction of a fixed code subspace operator using modular theory which can, in principle, be integrated to relate the reconstructed operators all along the flow. We observe a striking resemblance between our formulas for relational bulk reconstruction and the infinite-time limit of Connes cocycle flow, and take some steps towards making this connection more rigorous. We also provide alternative derivations of our reconstruction formulas in terms of a canonical reconstruction map we call the modular reflection operator.</description>

Abstract: A recently proposed pregeometric auxiliary vector mediated gauge theory is studied in its canonical domain, by performing the Legendre transform on a curved background and by considering its covariant phase space, with further application to duality. The constraints become differential equations, but the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm appears consistent with electromagnetic degrees of freedom, metric background permitting. Solving the consistency conditions provides a preferred direction in an intermediary form of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In parallel, the covariant phase space defines the symplectic structure, and establishes the conserved currents and quantum phenomenology with the generated background. The formalism immediately allows to study the parent path integrals of dual theories, with quartic Proca to Kalb-Ramond inequivalence and Maxwell-Chern-Simons path integral consistency as practical applications, while the differential geometry gives a global description of the issue of Yang-Mills duality rotations. Properties of degenerate metric geometry are discussed throughout, and the viability of inherent backgrounds leads into the fundamental question of background independence in all physical theories.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of braneworld holography, we construct a quantum charged black hole localized on a three-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) brane that intersects the asymptotic boundary of the four-dimensional AdS spacetime at the conformal defects and incorporates quantum backreaction effects from the conformal field theory (CFT) on the brane. This quantum charged black hole is an exact solution of the semiclassical gravitational equation corresponding to a theory with higher curvature gravity and nonminimally coupled nonlinear gauge field. In the framework of double holography, we investigate the thermodynamics of the quantum charged black hole from three perspectives: a pure bulk perspective, in which four-dimensional classical Einstein gravity couples to Maxwell electrodynamics and a codimension-one tensional brane; a brane perspective, where semiclassical higher curvature gravity is subject to quantum backreaction from the holographic CFT on the brane, yielding a quantum charged black hole; and a boundary perspective, where the defect CFT is coupled to a boundary CFT at the asymptotic boundary and the degrees of freedom for defect quantum conformal matter is considered. In so doing, we obtain doubly holographic formulations of both the first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr (energy) relations for the quantum charged black holes.</description>

      <title>Towards bit threads in general gravitational spacetimes</title>

Abstract: The concept of the generalized entanglement wedge was recently proposed by Bousso and Penington, which states that any bulk gravitational region $a$ possesses an associated generalized entanglement wedge $E(a)\supset a$ on a static Cauchy surface $M$ in general gravitational spacetimes, where $E(a)$ may contain an entanglement island $I(a)$. It suggests that the fine-grained entropy for bulk region $a$ is given by the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$. Motivated by this proposal, we extend the quantum bit thread description to general gravitational spacetimes, no longer limited to the AdS spacetime. By utilizing the convex optimization techniques, a dual flow description for the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ of a bulk gravitational region $a$ is established on the static Cauchy surface $M$, such that $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ is equal to the maximum flux of any flow that starts from the boundary $\partial M$ and ends at bulk region $a$, or equivalently, the maximum number of bit threads that connect the boundary $\partial M$ to the bulk region $a$. In addition, the nesting property of flows is also proved. Thus the basic properties of the entropy for bulk regions, i.e. the monotonicity, subadditivity, Araki-Lieb inequality and strong subadditivity, can be verified from flow perspectives by using properties of flows, such as the nesting property. Moreover, in max thread configurations, we find that there exists some lower bounds on the bulk entanglement entropy of matter fields in the region $E(a)\setminus a$, particularly on an entanglement island region $I(a) \subset (E(a)\setminus a)$, as required by the existence of a nontrivial generalized entanglement wedge. Our quantum bit thread formulation may provide a way to investigate more fine-grained entanglement structures in general spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Recent developments in static patch holography proposed that quantum gravity in de Sitter space admits a dual description in terms of a quantum mechanical theory living on a timelike surface near the cosmological horizon. In parallel, geometric observables associated with the Einstein-Rosen bridge of a black hole background were suggested to compute the computational complexity of the state dual to a gravitational theory. In this work, we pursue the study of the complexity=volume and complexity=action conjectures in a Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry perturbed by the insertion of a shockwave at finite boundary times. This analysis extends previous studies that focused either on the complexity=volume 2.0 conjecture, or on the case of a shockwave inserted along the cosmological horizon. We show that the switchback effect, describing the delay in the evolution of complexity in reaction to a perturbation, is a universal feature of the complexity proposals in asymptotically de Sitter space. The geometric origin of this phenomenon is related to the causal connection between the static patches of de Sitter space when a positive pulse of null energy is inserted in the geometry.</description>

      <title>Emergent Non-Invertible Symmetries Bridging UV and IR Phases -- The Adjoint QCD Example</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate how an emergent non-invertible symmetry along a renormalization group (RG) flow reveals connections between microscopic and macroscopic physics. We illustrate this using (3+1)-dimensional Adjoint QCD with two flavors of Weyl fermions as an example. For the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ case, C\'ordova and Dumitrescu proposed a non-supersymmetric deformation of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theory leading to dynamical abelianization, followed by monopole condensation, and resulting in a confining infrared (IR) phase characterized by disjoint copies of the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model. In this scenario, we point out that the abelianized phase has an emergent non-invertible symmetry, which is matched with the non-invertible symmetry of the IR $\mathbb{CP}^1$ phase, associated to the Hopf solitons. This result illustrate how an emergent non-invertible symmetry can be used to provide a bridge connecting the IR solitons and their properties with the ones of microscopic degrees of freedom in gauge theories with one-form symmetries. Moreover, based on this insight we generalize these results to other gauge theories with any number of colors, and propose a candidate for the UV baryon operator in all these cases.</description>

Abstract: We formulate general conditions under which the strong CP problem is solved by spontaneous CP violation. Quark-mass matrix elements are polynomials in the CP-breaking order parameters, engineered such that their determinant is a real constant. This scheme permits only a limited number of textures. These conditions can be realized in supersymmetric theories with CP as an anomaly-free local flavour symmetry, suggesting a unified solution to the strong CP problem and the flavour puzzle. Our solution can be implemented using either modular invariance or a local U(1) symmetry. We present modular-invariant realizations where matter fields are assigned small modular weights $\pm2$ ($\pm1$), utilising higher levels $N=2$ ($N=3$). Heavy quarks are in general not required, but their presence allows for models where colored particles fill non-singlet representations of the flavour group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in the $f(Q)$ gravity with a non-metricity scalar $Q$, the curvatures in Einstein's gravity, that is, the Riemann curvature constructed from the standard Levi-Civita connection, could not be excluded or naturally appear. The first observation is that even in $f(Q)$ gravity, the conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor is not described by the covariant derivatives in the non-metricity gravity but that is given by the Levi-Civita connection. The commutator of the covariant derivatives in Einstein's gravity inevitably induces the Riemann curvature. There is no symmetry nor principle which prohibits the Riemann curvature in non-metricity gravity. Based on this observation, we propose and investigate $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant $\mathcal{G}$ and its generalisations. We show how $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ models realising any given the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime can be reconstructed. We apply the reconstruction formalism to cosmology. Explicitly, the gravity models which realise slow roll or constant roll inflation, dark energy epoch as well as the unification of the inflation and dark energy are found. The dynamical autonomous system and the gravitational wave in the theory under investigation are discussed. It is found the condition that the de Sitter spacetime becomes the (stable) fixed point of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a geometrical object that generalizes the quantum geometric tensor; we call it $N$-bein. Analogous to the vielbein (orthonormal frame) used in the Cartan formalism, the $N$-bein behaves like a ``square root'' of the quantum geometric tensor. Using it, we present a quantum geometric tensor of two states that measures the possibility of moving from one state to another after two consecutive parameter variations. This new tensor determines the commutativity of such variations through its anti-symmetric part. In addition, we define a connection different from the Berry connection, and combining it with the $N$-bein allows us to introduce a notion of torsion and curvature \`{a} la Cartan that satisfies the Bianchi identities. Moreover, the torsion coincides with the anti-symmetric part of the two-state quantum geometric tensor previously mentioned, and thus, it is related to the commutativity of the parameter variations. We also describe our formalism using differential forms and discuss the possible physical interpretations of the new geometrical objects. Furthermore, we define different gauge invariants constructed from the geometrical quantities introduced in this work, resulting in new physical observables. Finally, we present two examples to illustrate these concepts: a harmonic oscillator and a generalized oscillator, both immersed in an electric field. We found that the new tensors quantify correlations between quantum states that were unavailable by other methods.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes of Loop Quantum Black Holes Formed from Gravitational Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field in the background of a large class of quantum black holes that can be formed from gravitational collapse of a dust fluid in the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. The loop quantum black holes (LQBHs) are characterized by three free parameters, one of which is the mass parameter, while the other two are purely due to quantum geometric effects. Among these two quantum parameters, one is completely fixed by black hole thermodynamics and its effects are negligible for macroscopic black holes, while the second parameter is completely free (in principle). In the studies of the QNMs of such LQBHs, we pay particular attention to the difference of the QNMs between LQBHs and classical ones, so that they can be observed for the current and forthcoming gravitational wave observations, whereby place the LQBH theory directly under the test of observations.</description>
