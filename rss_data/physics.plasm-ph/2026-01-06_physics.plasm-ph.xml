      <title>Plasma-Activated Water (PAW) for the Degradation of Organic Pollutants in Diluted Industrial Effluents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma activated water (PAW) offers a sustainable, nonthermal solution for degrading persistent organic pollutants in industrial effluents. This study employed a gliding arc plasma system to generate PAW for treating diluted waste water containing dyes, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. Experimental parameters such as exposure time, dilution ratio, and pollutant concentration were varied, with analysis conducted using UV Vis spectroscopy, HPLC, TOC, and COD. Results showed high degradation efficiencies, up to 90% for dyes, 85% for pesticides, and 80% for pharmaceuticals following pseudo first order kinetics driven by hydroxyl and nitrate or nitrite radicals. The findings demonstrate PAWs potential as a green, scalable wastewater treatment strategy that minimizes chemical use, supports water reuse, and enhances environmental safety, with future scope for pilot scale applications.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the space-charge dilemma in low-energy heavy ion beams via a multistage acceleration lens system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy heavy-ion beams are fundamentally limited by severe space-charge divergence, which constrains the transportable beam current to a few microamperes in conventional electrostatic accelerators. This limitation is particularly critical for high-mass ions, where the generalized perveance increases rapidly because of their low velocity. Here, we demonstrate that this apparent space-charge limit can be overcome by shaping the electrostatic potential configuration of an existing multistage accelerator, thereby transforming the acceleration column itself into a combined acceleration-focusing column. By optimizing the interstage voltage configuration, a strong electrostatic lens effect is superimposed on the accelerating field to counteract space-charge-driven expansion. We formulate a generalized design framework that quantitatively maps the transport 'design window' in terms of beam current, ion mass, and acceleration voltage. For gold ions at 64 keV, this approach enables stable transport of beam currents exceeding 100 microA, more than an order of magnitude higher than the conventional limit. Numerical phase-space analysis shows that this improvement is achieved by prioritizing envelope control over emittance preservation, a trade-off intrinsic to space-charge-dominated regimes. Our results establish a universal and practical guideline for high-current heavy-ion beam transport, relevant to fusion plasma diagnostics, ion implantation, and massive molecular ion applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid PIC-fluid model for numerical simulation of laser-plasma interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid PIC-fluid model is proposed for three dimensional numerical simulation of laser-plasma interaction. Ions are treated kinetically, electrons as a ten-moment fluid, capturing ion-scale dynamics, pressure anisotropy, and non-Maxwellian distributions efficiently. A laser-envelope model handles energy deposition and ponderomotive heating without resolving optical oscillations. Collisional and ionisation processes ensure self-consistent evolution of energy and charge states. The model is implemented in the AKAM code, providing a scalable framework that bridges fully kinetic and fluid approaches for high-energy-density and laboratory plasma applications.</description>

      <title>Excess energy of strongly coupled one-component plasma from variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excess energy of the one-component plasma fluid is calculated using the variational approach combined with different variants of the excess entropy of the hard-sphere fluid, which is used as a reference system. Our comparison with recent Monte Carlo results for the excess energy of the one-component plasma identifies the Percus-Yevick virial entropy as the most accurate entropy to be used in the variational calculation of this kind. The reason for this and potential developments of the present analysis are briefly discussed. We demonstrate that the original Rosenfeld-Tarazons scaling of the thermal component of the excess energy of the one-component plasma fluid is in excellent agreement with recent Monte Carlo results.</description>

      <title>Partially Ionized Plasma Physics and Technological Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially ionized plasma physics has attracted a lot of attention recently due to numerous technological applications made possible by the increased sophistication of computer modelling, the depth of the theoretical analysis, and the technological applications to a vast field of the manufacturing for computer components. The partially ionized plasma is characterized by a significant presence of neutral particles in contrast to fully ionized plasma. The theoretical analysis is based upon solutions of the kinetic Boltzmann equation yielding the non-Maxwellian electron energy distribution function (EEDF) thereby emphasizing the difference with a fully ionized plasma. The impact of the effect on discharges in inert and molecular gases is described in detail yielding the complex nonlinear phenomena in plasma self-organization. A few examples of such phenomena are given including the non-monotonic EEDFs in the discharge afterglow in mixture of argon with the molecular gas NF3; the explosive generation of cold electron populations in capacitive discharges, hysteresis of EEDF in inductively coupled plasmas. Recently, highly advanced computer codes were developed in order to address the outstanding problems of plasma technology. These developments are briefly described in general terms.</description>

      <title>Photonic Interactions with Semiconducting Barrier Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting Barrier Discharges (SeBDs) generate uniform ionization waves in air at atmospheric pressure. In this work, we investigate how externally applied irradiation synchronized with the discharge can mimic photoconductive-type coupling between the plasma and the semiconductor surface. By illuminating the Si-SiO$_2$ interface with nanosecond pulsed irradiation at wavelengths from 532 nm to 1064 nm, and using fast imaging, optical emission spectroscopy, and current-voltage measurements, we demonstrate that the photoexcitation of charge carriers in silicon enhances the plasma emission and increases the reduced electric field, with no detectable change in the electrical energy. The magnitude and thresholds of these responses depend on wavelength. By comparing the SeBD to a MOS photodetector, this behaviour can be explained by the absorption length. This length determines whether carriers are photogenerated inside the depletion region at the SiO$_2$-Si interface, where they are efficiently separated and undergo impact-ionization amplification, or deeper in the silicon bulk where carrier separation is weaker and free-carrier absorption diminishes the quantum efficiency. These results focus on the microscopic processes governing the plasma-semiconductor coupling and demonstrate how the optoelectronic properties of silicon can influence surface ionization waves.</description>

      <title>Towards solving the ICRH wave and Fokker-Planck equations self-consistently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper sketches a framework for solving the wave and Fokker-Planck equations in the ion cyclotron resonance frequency domain fully selfconsistently. It illustrates this can be done by first constructing "building blocks" that are commonly needed by the wave and Fokker-Planck equations, allowing e.g. to account for wave coupling in plasmas containing non-Maxwellian distributions. Up to details, the paper exploits known expressions and methods to solve the two intimately connected aspects of the description of the wave-particle interaction underlying ion cyclotron resonance heating. Two cases are presented: the case where the guiding centre motion is limited to just following magnetic field lines, and the extended case accounting for drifts away from magnetic surfaces but assuming axisymmetry. A limited set of analytical results is included. As combining wave and Fokker-Planck solving is the focus, the computation of the dielectric response for arbitrary distribution functions is illustrated as well.</description>

      <title>Variability of MHD Instabilities in Benign Termination of High-Current Runaway Electron Beams in the JET and DIII-D Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benign termination, in which magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities deconfine runaway electrons (REs) following hydrogenic injections, is a promising strategy for mitigating dangerous RE loads after disruptions. Recent experiments on the Joint European Torus (JET) have explored this scenario at higher pre-disruptive plasma currents than are achievable on other devices, revealing challenges in obtaining benign terminations at $I_p \geq 2.5$ MA. This work analyzes the evolution of these high-current RE beams and their terminating MHD events using fast magnetic sensor measurements and EFIT equilibrium reconstructions for approximately $40$ JET and $20$ DIII-D tokamak discharges. On JET, unsuccessful non-benign terminations occur at low edge safety factor ($q_{\text{edge}} \approx 2$), and are preceded by intermittent, non-terminating MHD events at higher rational $q_{\text{edge}}$. Trends in the internal inductance $l_i$ indicate more peaked RE current profiles in the high-$I_p$ non-benign population, which may hinder successful recombination through re-ionization. In contrast, benign terminations on JET typically occur at higher $q_{\text{edge}} \geq 3$ and exhibit less peaked RE current profiles. DIII-D displays a range of terminating edge safety factors, correlated with the measured $l_i$ values. Across both tokamaks, the RE current peaking is therefore found to determine which MHD instability boundary is encountered, confirmed by linear resistive MHD modeling with the CASTOR3D code. Measured growth rates are similar for benign and non-benign cases, indicating that ideal MHD timescales at low density after hydrogenic injection do not alone explain efficient RE deconfinement. Instead, non-benign cases are characterized by their lower MHD perturbation amplitudes $\delta B$. These observations suggest that the interplay between ideal and resistive dynamics governs the termination process.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional PIC Simulation of Induced Compton Scattering in Magnetized Electron-Positron Pair Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate induced Compton scattering of a circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave propagating in a magnetized electron-positron pair plasma using one-dimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. In this system, two distinct modes of density fluctuations, referred to as the charged mode and the neutral mode, are theoretically expected to arise through parametric instabilities. Our simulations confirm these predictions: in the charged mode, the electron and positron densities fluctuate oppositely (Langmuir-like), while in the neutral mode, the charge is Debye-screened and both species fluctuate in phase (acoustic-like). The linear growth rates obtained from the simulations are in good agreement with analytical estimates for both modes. We also find that, in some cases, the linear growth saturates before full scattering occurs, allowing the incident wave to propagate without significant attenuation. Our results allow us to determine whether induced Compton scattering grows linearly in magnetized pair plasmas, offering a foundation for studies of fast radio bursts and laser-plasma experiments.</description>

      <title>Ion Temperature Inference from Neutron Counting in Maxwellian Deuterium Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for inferring the deuterium fuel ion temperature from neutron counts measured with fast liquid scintillators in conditions where the ion velocity distribution is Maxwellian. Local neutron count rates at each scintillator position are combined to estimate total neutron yield from the plasma, where absolute detection efficiency is determined via MCNP neutron scattering simulation based on a 3D model of the experiment structure. This method is particularly advantageous for Magnetized Target Fusion applications as it yields a time-resolved diagnostic and does not require direct line-of-sight to the plasma or collimation of the neutrons. The instrumentation configuration, pulse-shape discrimination and pile-up correction algorithms, detector calibration, and ion temperature calculation method with uncertainty characterization are discussed. An application of the method to General Fusion's Plasma Injector~3 (PI3) spherical tokamak device is demonstrated and the results are compared to an Ion Doppler spectroscopy ion temperature diagnostic.</description>

      <title>Proton Acceleration by Collisionless Shocks in Supermassive Black Hole Coronae: Implications for High-Energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC~1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($&lt;1\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.</description>

      <title>Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thea Energy, Inc. has developed the preconceptual design for "Helios," a fusion power plant based on the planar coil stellarator architecture. In this overview paper, the design is summarized and the reader is referred to the other papers for more detail. The Helios design is based around a two-field-period quasi-axisymmetric ("QA") stellarator equilibrium with aspect ratio 4.5 and a novel tokamak-like X-point divertor. The natural stability, low recirculating power, and steady-state capability of the stellarator are leveraged. Stability and transport are calculated using state-of-the-art, high-fidelity codes and grounded in measured performance of existing experiments. The electromagnetic coil set is high-temperature superconducting ("HTS") and consists of 12 large, plasma-encircling coils like the toroidal field coils of a tokamak, and 324 smaller, field-shaping coils. All coils are planar and convex. A maximum of 20 T on-coil is enforced, a value which has been achieved in existing large-bore HTS coils. There is a minimum of 1.2 m between plasma and coils, leaving space for tritium breeding blanket and neutron shielding. Because of this thick shielding, all coils have a minimum 40-year operational lifetime, the same minimum lifetime of the power plant system. 1.1 GW of thermal power and 390 MW of net electric power are produced. The shaping coils are individually controllable, enabling a uniquely configurable magnetic field for relaxed manufacturing and assembly tolerances and plasma control. A practical maintenance architecture is a primary driver of the design; maintenance is performed on entire toroidal sectors that are removed from between the encircling coils. A biennial maintenance cycle is estimated to take approximately 84 days, resulting in an 88% capacity factor. Rigorous engineering constraints such as temperature and stress limits are enforced.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Surrogate Models using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models offer quick approximations to complex numerical and experimental systems but typically lack uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. While Bayesian methods provide uncertainty estimates, they offer no statistical guarantees and struggle with high-dimensional spatio-temporal problems due to computational costs. We present a conformal prediction (CP) framework that provides statistically guaranteed marginal coverage for surrogate models in a model-agnostic manner with near-zero computational cost. Our approach handles high-dimensional spatio-temporal outputs by performing cell-wise calibration while preserving the tensorial structure of predictions. Through extensive empirical evaluation across diverse applications including fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, weather forecasting, and fusion diagnostics, we demonstrate that CP achieves empirical coverage with valid error bars regardless of model architecture, training regime, or output dimensionality. We evaluate three nonconformity scores (conformalised quantile regression, absolute error residual, and standard deviation) for both deterministic and probabilistic models, showing that guaranteed coverage holds even for out-of-distribution predictions where models are deployed on physics regimes different from training data. Calibration requires only seconds to minutes on standard hardware. The framework enables rigorous validation of pre-trained surrogate models for downstream applications without retraining. While CP provides marginal rather than conditional coverage and assumes exchangeability between calibration and test data, our method circumvents the curse of dimensionality inherent in traditional uncertainty quantification approaches, offering a practical tool for trustworthy deployment of machine learning in physical sciences.</description>
