      <title>Practical Causal Evaluation Metrics for Biological Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating causal networks from biological data is a critical step in systems biology. When evaluating the inferred network, assessing the networks based on their intervention effects is particularly important for downstream probabilistic reasoning and the identification of potential drug targets. In the context of gene regulatory network inference, biological databases are often used as reference sources. These databases typically describe relationships in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner. However, few evaluation metrics have been developed that take this qualitative nature into account. To address this, we developed a metric, the sign-augmented Structural Intervention Distance (sSID), and a weighted sSID that incorporates the net effects of the intervention. Through simulations and analyses of real transcriptomic datasets, we found that our proposed metrics could identify a different algorithm as optimal compared to conventional metrics, and the network selected by sSID had a superior performance in the classification task of clinical covariates using transcriptomic data. This suggests that sSID can distinguish networks that are structurally correct but functionally incorrect, highlighting its potential as a more biologically meaningful and practical evaluation metric.</description>

      <title>Bifunctional enzyme action as a source of robustness in biochemical reaction networks: a novel hypergraph approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Substrate modification networks are ubiquitous in living, biochemical systems. A higher-level hypergraph "skeleton" captures key information about which substrates are transformed in the presence of modification-specific enzymes. Many different detailed models can be associated to the same skeleton, however uncertainty related to model fitting increases with the level of detail. We show that essential dynamical properties such as existence of positive steady states and concentration robustness can be extracted directly from the skeleton independent of the detailed model. The novel formalism of directed hypergraphs is used to prove that bifunctional enzyme action plays a key role in generating robustness. Moreover, we use another novel concept of "current" on a directed hypergraph to establish a link between potentially remote network components. Current is an essential notion required for existence of positive steady states, and furthermore, current-matching combined with bifunctionality generates concentration robustness.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Reinforcement Learning for Controlling Biological Networks - the GATTACA Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, identifying effective reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs.
  In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode, specifically in the context of cellular reprogramming. To solve it, we devise GATTACA, a scalable computational framework.
  To facilitate scalability of our framework, we consider previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and improve the procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. We then incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolution operations into the artificial neural network approximator of the DRL agent's action-value function. This allows us to leverage the available knowledge on the structure of a biological system and to indirectly, yet effectively, encode the system's modelled dynamics into a latent representation.
  Experiments on several large-scale, real-world biological networks from the literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.</description>
