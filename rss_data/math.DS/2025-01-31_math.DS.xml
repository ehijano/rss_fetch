      <title>A new family of integrable differential systems in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a wide class of differential systems in any dimension that are either integrable or complete integrable. In particular, our result enlarges a known family of planar integrable systems. We give an extensive list of examples that illustrates the applicability of our approach. For instance, in the plane this list includes some Li\'enard, Lotka--Volterra and quadratic systems; in the space, some Kolmogorov, Rikitake and R\"ossler systems. Examples of complete integrable systems in higher dimensions are also provided.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystals in pattern formation. Part II: Spatially almost-periodic profiles and global existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues our study of quasicrystals initiated in Part I. We propose a general mechanism for constructing quasicrystals, existing globally in time, in spatially-extended systems (partial differential equations with Euclidean symmetry) and demonstrate it on model examples of the Swift-Hohenberg and Brusselator equations. In contrast to Part I, our approach here emphasises the theory of almost-periodic functions as well as the global solvability of the corresponding equations in classes of spatially non-decaying functions. We note that the existence of such time-evolving quasicrystals with rotational symmetry of all orders, icosahedral symmetry, etc., does not require technical issues such as Diophantine properties and hard implicit function theorems, which look unavoidable in the case of steady-state quasicrystals.
  This paper can be largely read independently of Part I. Background material and definitions are repeated for convenience, but some elementary calculations from Part I are omitted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field complete with respect to a discrete valuation $v$ of residue characteristic $p$, and let $f(z) = z^\ell - c \in K[z]$ be a separable polynomial. We explore the connection between the valuation $v(c)$ and the Berkovich Julia set of $f$. Additionally, we examine the field extensions generated by the solutions to $f^n(z) = \alpha$ for a root point $\alpha \in K$, highlighting the interplay between the dynamics of $f$ and the ramification in the corresponding extensions.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive numerical investigation of a coupled mathematical model of neuronal excitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being an example for a relaxation oscillator, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model has been widely employed for describing the generation of action potentials. In this paper, we begin with a biological interpretation of what the subsequent mathematical and numerical analyses of the model entail. The interaction between action potential variable and recovery variable is then revisited through linear stability analysis around the equilibrium and local stability conditions are determined. Analytical results are compared with numerical simulations. The study aims to show an alternative approach regarding Taylor polynomials and constructed difference scheme which play a key role in the numerical approach for the problem. The robustness of the schemes is investigated in terms of convergency and stability of the techniques. This systematic approach by the combination of numerical techniques provides beneficial results which are uniquely designed for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. We describe the matrix representations with the collocation points. Then the method is applied in order to acquire a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. On the other hand, we apply finite difference scheme and its stability is also performed. Moreover, the numerical simulations are shown. Consequently, a comprehensive investigation of the related model is examined.</description>

      <title>Estimating unknown dynamics and cost as a bilinear system with Koopman-based Inverse Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of approximating unknown system dynamics and costs by representing them as a bilinear system using Koopman-based Inverse Optimal Control (IOC). Using optimal trajectories, we construct a bilinear control system in transformed state variables through a modified Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (EDMDc) that maintains exact dynamical equivalence with the original nonlinear system. We derive Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) optimality conditions for this system, which closely resemble those of the inverse Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem due to the consistent control input and state independence from the control. This similarity allows us to apply modified inverse LQR theory, offering a more tractable and robust alternative to nonlinear Inverse Optimal Control methods, especially when dealing with unknown dynamics. Our approach also benefits from the extensive analytical properties of bilinear control systems, providing a solid foundation for further analysis and application. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis, simulation studies and a robotic experiment, highlighting its potential for broader applications in the approximation and design of control systems.</description>

      <title>Real-analyticity of 2-dimensional superintegrable metrics and solution of two Bolsinov-Kozlov-Fomenko conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Riemannian metrics which are superintegrable in the class of polynomial in momenta integrals. The study is based on our main technical result, Theorem 3, which states that the Poisson bracket of two polynomial in momenta integrals is an algebraic function of
  the integrals and of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that two-dimensional superintegrable Riemannian metrics are necessary real-analytic in isothermal coordinate systems, and give arguments supporting this conjecture. Small modification of the arguments, discussed in the paper, provides a methods to construct new superintegrable systems. We prove a special case of the above conjecture which is sufficient to show that
  the metrics constructed by K. Kiyohara in 2001, which admit irreducible polynomial in momenta integrals of arbitrary high degree $k$, are not superintegrable and in particular do not admit nontrivial polynomial in momenta integral of degree less than $k$. This result solves Conjectures (b) and (c) explicitly formulated in Bolsinov, KOzlov and Fomenko in 1995.</description>

      <title>A minimal model for multigroup adaptive SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the adaptive N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (aNIMFA) model studied in Achterberg and Sensi (2023) to a heterogeneous network of communities. In particular, the multigroup aNIMFA model describes the impact of both local and global disease awareness on the spread of a disease in a network. We obtain results on existence and stability of the equilibria of the system, in terms of the basic reproduction number $R_0$. Assuming individuals have no reason to decrease their contacts in the absence of disease, we show that the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is equivalent to the basic reproduction number of the NIMFA model on static networks. Based on numerical simulations, we demonstrate that with just two communities periodic behaviour can occur, which contrasts the case with only a single community, in which periodicity was ruled out analytically. We also find that breaking connections between communities is more fruitful compared to breaking connections within communities to reduce the disease outbreak on dense networks, but both strategies are viable to networks with fewer links. Finally, we emphasize that our method of modelling adaptivity is not limited to SIS models, but has huge potential to be applied in other compartmental models in epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Seminorm estimates and joint ergodicity for pairwise independent Hardy sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) strongly irrationally independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations.
  We use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences, showing for instance that all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper density contain patterns
  \[ (m_1, m_2),\; (m_1 + \lfloor{n^{3/2}}\rfloor, m_2),\; (m_1, m_2 + \lfloor{n^{3/2} + n^{1/2}}\rfloor).\]
  Last but not least, we positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned families are special cases.
  While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own. We construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively control ergodic averages along Hardy sequences. We subsequently use them to obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. Furthermore, we develop an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument that has recently found extensive use in combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Lastly, we improve simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences.</description>

      <title>Studying network of symmetric periodic orbit families of the Hill problem via symplectic invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the spatial circular Hill three-body problem we illustrate the application of symplectic invariants to analyze the network structure of symmetric periodic orbit families. The extensive collection of families within this problem constitutes a complex network, fundamentally comprising the so-called basic families of periodic solutions, including the orbits of the satellite $g$, $f$, the libration (Lyapunov) $a,c$, and collision $\mathcal B_0$ families. Since the Conley-Zehnder index leads to a grading on the local Floer homology and its Euler characteristics, a bifurcation invariant, the computation of those indices facilitates the construction of well-organized bifurcation graphs depicting the interconnectedness among families of periodic solutions. The critical importance of the symmetries of periodic solutions in comprehending the interaction among these families is demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a smooth vector field $F$ of $S^3$ generates a sufficiently complicated heteroclinic knot, the flow also generates infinitely many periodic orbits, which persist under smooth perturbations which preserve the heteroclinic knot. Consequentially, we then associate a Template with the flow dynamics - regardless of whether $F$ satisfies any hyperbolicity condition or not. In addition, inspired by the Thurston-Nielsen Classification Theorem, we also conclude topological criteria for the existence of chaotic dynamics for three-dimensional flows - which we apply to study both the R\"ossler and Lorenz attractors.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the FitzHugh-Nagumo $(1,1)$--fast-slow system where the vector fields associated to the slow/fast equations come from the reduction of the Hodgin-Huxley model for the nerve impulse. After deriving dynamical properties of the singular and regular cases, we perform a bifurcation analysis and we investigate how the parameters (of the affine slow equation) impact the dynamics of the system. The study of codimension one bifurcations and the numerical locus of canards concludes this case-study. All theoretical results are numerically illustrated.</description>

  As applications: 1) An invariant measure for a locally compact amenable group action has a discrete spectrum if and only if it has bounded mean-complexity along F\o lner sequences; 2) An invariant measure for a locally compact amenable group action has a discrete spectrum if and only if it is mean equicontinuous along a tempered F\o lner sequence, or equicontinuous in the mean along a tempered F\o lner sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent demonstration of drastically different turbulent flow dynamics of an EVP fluid by Abdelgawad et al. (Nat. Phys., 2023, 1-5.), we analyse the linear stability of the sliding Couette flow of an EVP fluid. After yielding, the EVP fluid behaves as an Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM) fluid. In the creeping-flow limit, in the absence of yield stress, two discrete linearly stable Gorodtsov and Leonov (GL) modes exist for an arbitrarily high value of the Weissenberg number. As yield stress effects, i.e., Bingham number increases, the GL modes become unstable, leading to the novel instability. Analysis reveals that these modes originate near the boundaries due to the `extra normal stress' arising from the interplay between yield stress and elasticity. The extra normal stress is an inherent feature of an EVP fluid. Thus, the predicted novel instability is expected to be present in wall-bounded flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A one-dimensional cellular automaton $\tau : A^\mathbb{Z} \to A^\mathbb{Z}$ is a transformation of the full shift defined via a finite neighborhood $S \subset \mathbb{Z}$ and a local function $\mu : A^S \to A$. We study the family of cellular automata whose finite neighborhood $S$ is an interval containing $0$, and there exists a pattern $p \in A^S$ satisfying that $\mu(z) = z(0)$ if and only if $z \neq p$; this means that these cellular automata have a unique \emph{active transition}. Despite its simplicity, this family presents interesting and subtle problems, as the behavior of the cellular automaton completely depends on the structure of $p$. We show that every cellular automaton $\tau$ with a unique active transition $p \in A^S$ is either idempotent or strictly almost equicontinuous, and we completely characterize each one of these situations in terms of $p$. In essence, the idempotence of $\tau$ depends on the existence of a certain subpattern of $p$ with a translational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dynamics and Probability Analysis for a Generalized Epidemic Model with Environmental Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a stochastic SEIQR (susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered) epidemic model with a generalized incidence function. Using the Lyapunov method, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the model, ensuring that it remains well-defined over time. Through the application of Young's inequality and Chebyshev's inequality, we demonstrate the concepts of stochastic ultimate boundedness and stochastic permanence, providing insights into the long-term behavior of the epidemic dynamics under random perturbations. Furthermore, we derive conditions for stochastic extinction, which describe scenarios where the epidemic may eventually die out, and V-geometric ergodicity, which indicates the rate at which the system's state converges to its equilibrium. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our theoretical results and assess the model's behavior under different parameters.</description>
