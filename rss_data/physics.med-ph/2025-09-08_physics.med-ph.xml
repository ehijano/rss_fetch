      <title>Characterization of a novel plastic scintillation detector for in vivo electron dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Real-time dosimetry of surface dose in electron beams has not been widely established yet, but offers further insights for radiotherapy. Plastic scintillation detectors (PSD) promise high spatial resolution and real-time dosimetry with minimum perturbation of the radiation field. This study characterizes a novel PSD for the first time in an electron beam with the purpose of in-vivo dosimetry. Methods: Dosimetric characterization and dual channel Cherenkov correction were investigated using reference ionization chambers. Percentage depth dose curves, lateral profiles and output-factors were compared to reference ionization chambers. Surface doses were measured on solid water and on an anthropomorphic phantom and compared to ionization chamber and radiochromic film measurements. Results: The investigated PSD demonstrated clinically acceptable linearity, dose rate independence, isotropy and reproducibility (total variation &lt;2%). The detector measured R50 and R80 to 0.5 mm accuracy and lateral profiles with a mean absolute error below 1.5%. Small field measurements were within 2% of reference ionization chamber. Surface dose measurements had a relative deviation of 0.9% from ionization chamber and 2.6% from radiochromic film measurements. Conclusion: The PSD investigated in the present study is suitable for clinically acceptable electron beam dosimetry and provides accurate surface dose measurements in phantom experiments. It has the potential to be used in vivo for real-time dosimetry.</description>

      <title>Object independent scatter sensitivities for PET, applied to scatter estimation through fast Monte Carlo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattered coincidences introduce quantitative bias in positron emission tomography and must be compensated during reconstruction using an estimated scatter sinogram. These estimates are typically derived from simulators with simplified cylindrical scanner models that omit detector physics. Incorporating detector sensitivities for scatter is challenging, as scattered coincidences exhibit less constrained properties (e.g., incidence angles) than true events. We integrated a 5D single-photon detection probability lookup table (LUT; based on photon properties) into the simulator logic. The resulting scatter sinogram is scaled by a precomputed, LUT-specific scatter sensitivity sinogram to yield the final estimate. Scatter was simulated using MCGPU-PET, a fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulator with a simplified scanner model, and applied to phantom data from a simulated GE Signa PET/MR in GATE. We evaluated three scenarios: (1) long, high-count simulations from a known activity distribution (reference); (2) same distribution with limited simulation time and counts; (3) same low-count data with joint estimation of activity and scatter during reconstruction. In scenario 1, scatter-compensated reconstructions achieved &lt;1% global bias in all active regions relative to true-only reconstructions. In scenario 2, noisy scatter estimates caused strong positive bias, but Gaussian smoothing restored accuracy to scenario 1 levels. In scenario 3, joint estimation under low-count conditions maintained &lt;1% global bias in nearly all regions. Though demonstrated with a fast MC simulator, the proposed scatter sensitivity modeling could enhance existing single scatter simulators used clinically, which typically neglect detector physics. This proof-of-concept supports the feasibility of scatter estimation for real scans using fast MC simulation, offering improved accuracy and robustness to acquisition noise.</description>

      <title>HEEPidermis: a versatile SoC for BioZ recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological impedance (BioZ) is an information-packed modality that allows for non-invasive monitoring of health and emotional state. Currently, most research involving tissue impedance is based on bulky or fixed-purpose hardware, which limits the scope of research and the possibilities of experiments. In this work, we present HEEPidermis: a System-on-Chip (SoC) which integrates all the blocks needed for tissue impedance measurement, including two 8-bit, arbitrary-signal current DACs, two VCO-based ADCs, and a RISC-V CPU to enable on-chip feature extraction for closed-loop operation. An event-based sub-sampler improves storage and energy efficiency for long-term recording. In addition to the versatile SoC, the digital back-end and behavioral models of the analog front-end are open-source, allowing fast system-level simulations or repurposing. The SoC was taped out on TSMC 65 nm LP process.</description>

      <title>Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of AI-driven MRI Motion Artifact Detection and Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions. Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models, show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed, including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient care outcomes.</description>

      <title>HDN: Hybrid Deep-Learning and Non-Line-of-Sight Reconstruction Framework for Transcranial Photoacoustic Imaging of Human Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the deep penetration depth of ultrasonic imaging, showing great potential in cerebrovascular disease detection. However, the ultrasonic wave suffers strong attenuation and multi-scattering when it passes through the skull tissue, resulting in the distortion of the collected photoacoustic signal. In this paper, inspired by the principles of deep learning and non-line-of-sight imaging, we propose an image reconstruction framework named HDN (Hybrid Deep-learning and Non-line-of-sight), which consists of the signal extraction part and difference utilization part. The signal extraction part is used to correct the distorted signal and reconstruct an initial image. The difference utilization part is used to make further use of the signal difference between the distorted signal and corrected signal, reconstructing the residual image between the initial image and the target image. The test results on a photoacoustic digital brain simulation dataset show that compared with the traditional method (delay-and-sum) and deep-learning-based method (UNet), the HDN achieved superior performance in both signal correction and image reconstruction. Specifically for the structural similarity index, the HDN reached 0.661 in imaging results, compared to 0.157 for the delay-and-sum method and 0.305 for the deep-learning-based method.</description>

      <title>Minibeam-pLATTICE: A novel proton LATTICE modality using minibeams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: LATTICE, a form of spatially fractionated radiation therapy that delivers high-dose peaks and low-dose valleys within the target, has been clinically utilized for treating bulky tumors. However, its application to small-to-medium-sized target remains challenging due to beam size limitations. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel proton LATTICE (pLATTICE) modality using minibeams, namely minibeam-pLATTICE, that extends LATTICE approach for small-to-medium targets. Methods: Three minibeam-pLATTICE methods are introduced. (1) M0: a fixed minibeam orientation for all beam angles; (2) M1: alternated minibeam orientations, for consecutive beam angles; (3) M2: multiple minibeam orientations for each beam angle. For each minibeam-pLATTICE method, an optimization problem is formulated to optimize dose uniformity in target peaks and valleys, as well as dose-volume-histogram-based objectives. This problem is solved using iterative convex relaxation and alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Three minibeam-pLATTICE methods are validated to demonstrate the feasibility of minibeam-pLATTICE for head-and-neck cases. The advantages of this modality over conventional beam (CONV) pLATTICE are evaluated by comparing peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR) and dose delivered to organs at risk (OAR). All three minibeam-pLATTICE modalities achieved improved plan quality compared to CONV, with M2 yielding the best results. For example, in terms of PVDR, M2=5.89, compared to CONV=4.13, M0=4.87 and M1=4.7. Conclusion: A novel minibeam-pLATTICE modality is proposed that generates lattice dose patterns for small-to-medium targets, which are not achievable with conventional pLATTICE due to beam size limitations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing normal tissue sparing via spatiotemporal optimization under equivalent tumor-radical efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Spatiotemporal optimization in radiation therapy involves determining the optimal number of dose delivery fractions (temporal) and the optimal dose per fraction (spatial). Traditional approaches focus on maximizing the biologically effective dose (BED) to the target while constraining BED to organs-at-risk (OAR), which may lead to insufficient BED for complete tumor cell kill. This work proposes a formulation that ensures adequate BED delivery to the target while minimizing BED to the OAR. Approach: A spatiotemporal optimization model is developed that incorporates an inequality constraint to guarantee sufficient BED for tumor cell kill while minimizing BED to the OAR. The model accounts for tumor proliferation dynamics, including lag time (delay before proliferation begins) and doubling time (time for tumor volume to double), to optimize dose fractionation. Results: The performance of our formulation is evaluated for varying lag and doubling times. The results show that mean BED to the target consistently meets the minimum requirement for tumor cell kill. Additionally, the mean BED to OAR varies based on tumor proliferation dynamics. In the prostate case with lag time of 7 days and doubling time of 2 days, it is observed that mean BED delivered to femoral head is lowest at around 20 fractions, making this an optimal choice. While in the head-and-neck case, mean BED to OAR decreases as the number of fractions increases, suggesting that a higher number of fractions is optimal. Significance: A spatiotemporal optimization model is presented that minimizes BED to the OAR while ensuring sufficient BED for tumor cell kill. By incorporating tumor lag and doubling time, the approach identifies optimal number of fractions. This model can be extended to support hyperfractionation or accelerated fractionation strategies, offering a versatile tool for clinical treatment planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Beam angle optimization (BAO) is a critical component of radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning, where small changes in beam configuration can significantly impact treatment quality, especially for proton RT. Mathematically, BAO is a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, which is NP-hard due to its exponential growing search space. Traditional optimization techniques often struggle with computational efficiency, necessitating the development of novel approaches. Purpose: This study introduces QC-BAO, a hybrid quantum-classical approach that leverages quantum computing to solve the MIP formulation of BAO. Methods: The proposed approach, QC-BAO, models BAO as an MIP problem, incorporating binary variables for beam angle selection and continuous variables for optimizing spot intensities for proton therapy. The proposed approach employs a hybrid quantum-classical framework, utilizing quantum computing to solve the binary decision component while integrating classical optimization techniques, including iterative convex relaxation and alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Computational experiments were conducted on clinical test cases to evaluate QC-BAO's performance against clinically verified angles and a heuristic approach, GS-BAO. QC-BAO demonstrated improved treatment plan quality over both clinical and GS-BAO. The method consistently increased the conformity index (CI) for target coverage while reducing mean and maximum doses to organs-at-risk (OAR). Additionally, QC-BAO produced the lowest objective function value, confirming its superior optimization capability. Conclusions: The findings highlight the potential of quantum computing to enhance the solution to BAO problem by demonstrated improvement in plan quality using the proposed method, QC-BAO. This study paves the way for future clinical implementation of quantum-accelerated optimization in RT.</description>

      <title>Generating Synthetic Contrast-Enhanced Chest CT Images from Non-Contrast Scans Using Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for diagnosing and monitoring thoracic diseases, including aortic pathologies. However, contrast agents pose risks such as nephrotoxicity and allergic-like reactions. The ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) images without contrast administration would be transformative, enhancing patient safety and accessibility while reducing healthcare costs. In this study, we propose the first bridge diffusion-based solution for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CTA images from non-contrast CT scans. Our approach builds on the Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SC-BBDM), leveraging its ability to model complex mappings while maintaining consistency across slices. Unlike conventional slice-wise synthesis methods, our framework preserves full 3D anatomical integrity while operating in a high-resolution 2D fashion, allowing seamless volumetric interpretation under a low memory budget. To ensure robust spatial alignment, we implement a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that includes resampling, registration using the Symmetric Normalization method, and a sophisticated dilated segmentation mask to extract the aorta and surrounding structures. We create two datasets from the Coltea-Lung dataset: one containing only the aorta and another including both the aorta and heart, enabling a detailed analysis of anatomical context. We compare our approach against baseline methods on both datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving vascular structures while enhancing contrast fidelity.</description>
