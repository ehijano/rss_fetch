      <title>Quasi-periodic pulsations in extreme-ultraviolet brightenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observations have revealed small-scale transient brightenings that may share common physical mechanisms with larger-scale solar flares. A notable feature of solar and stellar flares is the presence of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), which are considered a common and potentially intrinsic characteristic. Aims. We investigate the properties of QPPs detected in EUV brightenings, which are considered small-scale flares, and compare their statistical properties with those observed in solar and stellar flares. Methods. We extracted integrated light curves of 22,623 EUV brightenings in two quiet Sun regions observed by the Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager and identified QPPs in their light curves using Fourier analysis. Results. Approximately 2.7 % of the EUV brightenings exhibited stationary QPPs. The QPP occurrence rate increased with the surface area, lifetime, and peak brightness of the EUV brightenings. The detected QPP periods ranged from approximately 15 to 260 seconds, which is comparable to the periods observed in solar and stellar flares. Consistent with observations of QPPs in solar and stellar flares, no correlation was found between the QPP period and peak brightness. However, unlike the trend observed in solar flares, no correlation was found between the QPP period and lifetime/length scale. Conclusions. The presence of QPPs in EUV brightenings supports the interpretation that these events may be small-scale manifestations of flares, and the absence of period scaling with loop length further suggests that standing waves may not be the primary driver of QPPs in these events.</description>

      <title>Starspots on eclipsing giant stars I.: The sample and eclipse mapping examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spotted stars in eclipsing binary systems allow us to gather significant information about the stellar surface inhomogeneities that is otherwise impossible from only photometric data. Starspots can be scanned using the eclipse (or transit) mapping technique, which takes advantage of the passage of a companion star (or planet) in front of a spotted giant star in a binary system. Based on the characteristics of their ultra-precise space photometric light curves, we compile a list of eclipsing binaries whose primary component is a spotted subgiant or giant star, with the aim of applying the eclipse mapping technique to them. Eclipsing binaries with giant primaries were selected from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves by visual inspection. Spots showing up as bumps during eclipses are modeled with an eclipse mapping technique specialized for two stars, and the number of spots are found with the help of Bayes factors. The full light curves themselves were analyzed with time series spot modeling, and the results of the two approaches were compared. We present a catalog of 29 eclipsing close binaries with active giant components and analyze TIC 235934420, TIC 271892852 and TIC 326257590 from the Continuous Viewing Zones (CVZ) of TESS. Remarkable agreement is found between the starspot temperatures, sizes, and longitudes from the eclipse mapping results and the corresponding full light curve solutions. Spots are always present at the substellar points of the tidally locked binaries. Data from the TESS CVZ allow us to follow the changes of spot patterns on yearly timescales.</description>

      <title>[PK2008] HalphaJ115927 and IGR J14091-6108: Two new intermediate polars above the period gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed timing analyses of two cataclysmic variables (CVs), [PK2008] HalphaJ115927 and IGR J14091-610, utilizing the optical data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Periods of 7.20$\pm$0.02 h, 1161.49$\pm$0.14 s, and 1215.99$\pm$0.15 s are presented for [PK2008] HalphaJ115927, and are interpreted as the probable orbital, spin, and beat periods of the system, respectively. The presence of multiple periodic variations suggests that it likely belongs to the intermediate polar (IP) category of magnetic CVs. Interestingly, [PK2008] HalphaJ115927 exhibits a unique and strong periodic modulation at 5.66$\pm$0.29 d, which may result from the precession of an accretion disc, similar to the IP TV Col. The detection of a spin signal of 576.63$\pm$0.03 s and inferred orbital signal of $\sim$ 15.84 h supports the classification of IGR J14091-610 as an IP. The identification of such a long orbital period adds a new example to the limited population of long-period IPs. The observed dominant signal at the second harmonic of the orbital frequency also suggests ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary in this system. The observed double-peaked spin pulse profile in [PK2008] HalphaJ115927 likely results from two-pole accretion, where both poles contribute to the spin modulation, and their geometry allows equal visibility of both accreting poles. In contrast, IGR J14091-610 exhibits a single-peaked sinusoidal like spin pulse, attributed to the changing visibility of the accretion curtains due to a relatively low dipole inclination. The present observations indicate that accretion in both systems occurs predominantly through a disc.</description>

      <title>Policy-Based Radiative Transfer: Solving the $2$-Level Atom Non-LTE Problem using Soft Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach for solving the classical 2-level atom non-LTE radiative transfer problem by framing it as a control task in which an RL agent learns a depth-dependent source function $S(\tau)$ that self-consistently satisfies the equation of statistical equilibrium (SE). The agent's policy is optimized entirely via reward-based interactions with a radiative transfer engine, without explicit knowledge of the ground truth. This method bypasses the need for constructing approximate lambda operators ($\Lambda^*$) common in accelerated iterative schemes. Additionally, it requires no extensive precomputed labeled datasets to extract a supervisory signal, and avoids backpropagating gradients through the complex RT solver itself. Finally, we show through experiment that a simple feedforward neural network trained greedily cannot solve for SE, possibly due to the moving target nature of the problem. Our $\Lambda^*-\text{Free}$ method offers potential advantages for complex scenarios (e.g., atmospheres with enhanced velocity fields, multi-dimensional geometries, or complex microphysics) where $\Lambda^*$ construction or solver differentiability is challenging. Additionally, the agent can be incentivized to find more efficient policies by manipulating the discount factor, leading to a reprioritization of immediate rewards. If demonstrated to generalize past its training data, this RL framework could serve as an alternative or accelerated formalism to achieve SE. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first application of reinforcement learning in solar physics that directly solves for a fundamental physical constraint.</description>

      <title>Detection of an Explosive Outflow in G34.26+0.15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on the detection of a likely explosive outflow in the high-mass star-forming complex G34.26+0.15, adding to the small number (six) of explosive outflows detected so far. ALMA CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) archival observations reveal multiple outflow streamers from G34.26+0.15, which correlate well with H2 jets identified from Spitzer-IRAC 4.5 um and [4.5]/[3.6] flux ratio maps. These nearly linear outflow streamers originate from a common center within an ultracompact HII region located in the complex. The velocity spread of the outflow streamers ranges from 0 to 120 km/s. The radial velocities of these streamers follow the Hubble-Lema\^itre velocity law, indicating an explosive nature. From the CO emission, the total outflow mass, momentum, and outflow energy are estimated to be ~264 M_sun, 4.3*10^3 M_sun km/s, and 10^48 erg, respectively. The event triggering the outflow may have occurred about 19,000 years ago and could also be responsible for powering the expanding UC HII region, given the similar dynamical ages and positional coincidence of the UC HII region with the origin of the outflow. The magnetic field lines in the region associated with G34.26+0.15 also appear to align with the direction of the outflow streamers and jets, possibly being dragged by the explosive outflow.</description>

      <title>3D Maser polarization simulation for J=1-0 SiO masers in the circumstellar envelope of an AGB star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SiO masers from AGB stars exhibit variability in intensity and polarization during a pulsation period. This variability is explained by radiative transfer and magnetic properties of the molecule. To investigate this phenomenon, a 3D maser simulation is employed to study the SiO masers based on Zeeman splitting. We demonstrate that the magnetic field direction affects maser polarization within small tubular domains with isotropic pumping, and yields results that are similar to those obtained from 1D modelling. This work also studies larger clouds with different shapes. We use finite-element domains with internal node distributions to represent the maser-supporting clouds. We calculate solutions for the population inversions in all transitions and at every node. These solutions show that saturation begins near the middle of a domain, moving towards the edges and particularly the ends of long axes, as saturation progresses, influencing polarization. When the observer's view of the domain changes, the plane of linear polarization responds to the projected shape and the projected magnetic field axis. The angle between the observer's line of sight and the magnetic field may cause jumps in the plane of polarization. Therefore, we can conclude that polarization is influenced by both the cloud's major axis orientation and magnetic field direction. We have investigated the possibility of explaining observed polarization plane rotations, apparently within a single cloud, by the mechanism of line-of-sight overlap of two magnetized maser clouds.</description>

      <title>Stochastic low-frequency variability of 50 massive stars in the Cygnus OB associations and the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, high-precision high-cadence space photometry has revealed that stochastic low frequency (SLF) variability is common in the light curves of massive stars. We use the data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study and characterize the SLF variability found in a sample of 49 O- and B-type main-sequence stars across six Cygnus OB~associations and one low-metallicity SMC star AV~232. We compare these results to 53 previously studied SLF variables. We adopt two different methods for characterizing the signal. In the first, we follow earlier work and fit a Lorentzian-like profile to the power density spectrum of the residual light curve to derive the amplitude $\alpha_0$, characteristic frequency $\nu_{\rm char}$, and slope $\gamma$ of the variability. In our second model-independent method, we calculate the root-mean-square (RMS) of the photometric variability as well as the frequency at 50\% of the accumulated power spectral density, $\nu_{50\%}$, and the width of the cumulative integrated power density, $w$. For the full sample of 103 SLF variables, we find that $\alpha_0$, $\gamma$, RMS, $\nu_{50\%}$, and $w$ correlate with the spectroscopic luminosity of the stars. Both $\alpha_0$ and RMS appear to increase for more evolved stars whereas $\nu_{\rm char}$ and $\nu_{50\%}$ both decrease. Finally, we compare our results to 2-D and 3-D simulations of subsurface convection, core-generated internal gravity waves, and surface stellar winds, and find good agreement between the observed $\nu_{\rm char}$ of our sample and predictions from sub-surface convection.</description>

      <title>Identifying eclipsing binary stars with TESS data based on a new hybrid deep learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing binary systems (EBs), as foundational objects in stellar astrophysics, have garnered significant attention in recent years. These systems exhibit periodic decreases in light intensity when one star obscures the other from the observer's perspective, producing characteristic light curves (LCs). With the advent of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), a vast repository of stellar LCs has become available, offering unprecedented opportunities for discovering new EBs. To efficiently identify such systems, we propose a novel method that combines LC data and generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms (GLS) data to classify EBs. At the core of this method is CNN Attention LSTM Net (CALNet), a hybrid deep learning model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and an Attention Mechanism based on the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We collected 4,225 EB samples, utilizing their 2-minute cadence LCs for model training and validation. CALNet achieved a recall rate of 99.1%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Applying it to TESS 2-minute LCs from Sectors 1 to 74, we identified 9,351 new EBs after manual visual inspection, significantly expanding the known sample size. This work highlights the potential of advanced deep-learning techniques in large-scale astronomical surveys and provides a valuable resource for further studies on EBs.</description>

      <title>Small-scale dynamic phenomena associated with interacting fan-spine topologies: quiet-Sun Ellerman bombs, UV brightenings, and chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QSEBs are small-scale magnetic reconnection events in lower solar atmosphere. Sometimes, they exhibit transition region counterparts, known as UV brightenings. Magnetic field extrapolations suggest that QSEBs can occur at various locations of a fan-spine topology, with UV brightening occurring at null point through a common reconnection process. We aim to understand how complex magnetic configurations like interacting fan-spine topologies can cause small-scale dynamic phenomena in lower atmosphere. QSEBs were detected using k-means clustering on Hbeta observations from Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). Further, chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets were identified in the Hbeta blue wing. Magnetic field topologies were determined through potential field extrapolations from photospheric magnetograms using the Fe I 6173 A line. UV brightenings were detected in IRIS 1400 A SJI. We identify two distinct magnetic configurations associated with QSEBs, UV brightenings, and chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets. The first involves a nested fan-spine structure where, due to flux emergence, an inner 3D null forms inside fan surface of an outer 3D null with some overlap. QSEBs occur at two footpoints along the shared fan surface, with UV brightening located near the outer 3D null point. The jet originates close to the two QSEBs and follows the path of high squashing factor Q. We discuss a comparable scenario using a numerical simulation. In second case, two adjacent fan-spine topologies share fan footpoints at a common positive polarity patch, with the QSEB, along with a chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jet, occurring at the intersection having high Q values. This study demonstrates through observational and modelling support that associated QSEBs, UV brightenings, and chromospheric inverted-Y-shaped jets share a common origin driven by magnetic reconnection between interacting fan-spine topologies.</description>

      <title>The jet and circumstellar environment of the young binary DF Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets and disc winds play an important role in the evolution of protoplanetary discs and the formation of planetary systems. However, there is still a lack of observational data regarding the presence and parameters of outflows, especially for close young binaries. In this study, we aim to find the HH flow near the young sub-arcsecond binary DF Tau and explore its morphology. Narrow-band H$\alpha$ and H$_2$ 2.12 $\mu$m imaging and spectroscopic observations of DF Tau and its vicinity were performed. We have discovered several emission nebulae near the binary, which likely result from the interaction of gas outflow from the binary components with the surrounding medium. The outflow appears to occur both in the form of jets, generating numerous Herbig-Haro objects (HH 1266 flow), and as a weakly collimated wind responsible for the formation of the ring-like nebula around the binary and the rim of the cometary globule. We have found that the angle between the jet and the counter-jet is $168^\circ$ and discuss the complex morphology of the HH flow.</description>

      <title>Enhancing SED-Based Astrometric, Photometric, and Kinematic Studies of SAI 72 and SAI 75 Using Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the open clusters SAI 72 and SAI 75 using Gaia DR3 data, employing the Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis (ASteCA) tool to determine their structural and fundamental properties, including center coordinates, size, age, distance, mass, luminosity, and kinematics. Based on membership probabilities (P &gt;= 50%), we identified 112 and 115 stars as probable members of SAI 72 and SAI 75, respectively. Radial density profile (RDP) analysis yielded cluster radii of 2.35 arcmin for SAI 72 and 2.19 arcmin for SAI 75. The spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting was performed to refine metallicity, distance, and color excess parameters, ensuring consistency within 1 sigma of isochrone-based estimates. Isochrone fitting of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) suggests ages of 316 Myr and 302 Myr, with corresponding distances of 3160 +/- 80 pc and 3200 +/- 200 pc. We derived their Galactic positions, projected distances (X_sun, Y_sun), and vertical displacements (Z_sun). Mass function analysis estimates cluster masses of 612 +/- 174 solar masses for SAI 72 and 465 +/- 90 solar masses for SAI 75. Kinematic studies indicate that both clusters have reached dynamical equilibrium. The AD diagram method provided convergent point coordinates of (A, D)_o = (97.016 +/- 0.09, 4.573 +/- 0.05) for SAI 72 and (99.677 +/- 0.10, 1.243 +/- 0.09) for SAI 75. Orbital analysis confirms that both clusters follow nearly circular trajectories with low eccentricities and minor variations in apogalactic and perigalactic distances. Furthermore, we determine that SAI 72 and SAI 75 originated beyond the solar circle at R_Birth = 10.825 +/- 0.068 kpc and R_Birth = 9.583 +/- 0.231 kpc, respectively. Their maximum heights above the Galactic plane, Z_max, are 109 +/- 9 pc for SAI 72 and 232 +/- 24 pc for SAI 75, reinforcing their classification as part of the young stellar disc population.</description>

Based on the ASteCA code, we determined the most probable star candidates (P &gt;= 50%) and estimated the number of star members of each cluster as 125, 158, and 138, respectively. We estimated the internal structural parameters by fitting the King model to the observed RDPs, including the core, limited, and tidal radii. The isochrone fitting to the color-magnitude diagram provided log(age) values of 9.13 +/- 0.04, 8.10 +/- 0.04, and 8.65 +/- 0.04 and distances of 3790 +/- 94 pc, 3900 +/- 200 pc, and 3120 +/- 30 pc for SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86, respectively. We also calculated their projected distances from the Galactic plane (X_sun, Y_sun) as well as their vertical distances (Z_sun), Galactocentric distances (R_gc), and total masses (M_C) in solar units, which are about 142 +/- 12, 302 +/- 17, and 192 +/- 14 for SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86, respectively. Examining the dynamical relaxation state indicates that all three clusters are dynamically relaxed. By undertaking a kinematic analysis of the cluster data, the space velocity was determined. We calculated the coordinates of the apex point (A_o, D_o) using the AD diagram method along with the derivation of the solar motion parameters (S_sun, l_A, b_A). Through our detailed dynamic orbit analysis, we determined that the three SAI clusters belong to the young stellar disc, confirming their membership within this component of the Galactic structure.</description>

      <title>Are Kronberger 80 and/or Kronberger 82 regions PeVatron candidates for LHAASO J2108+5157?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays have been detected in the region of LHAASO~J2108+5157 by the Fermi--LAT, HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observatories. Cygnus~OB2 in Cygnus--X has been confirmed as the first strong stellar cluster PeVatron in our Galaxy. Thus, the star--forming regions Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82, located in the field of LHAASO~J2108+5157, are analyzed to evaluate their stellar population and potential as associated PeVatron candidates. A distance of 10~kpc is adopted for Kronberger~80, while $\sim$1.6~kpc is estimated for Kronberger~82. Based on stellar densities, we report that their cluster radii are 2.5$\arcmin$ and 2.0$\arcmin$, while IR photometry reveals poor stellar content in massive O-type stars in both cases. From optical data, the estimation of cluster ages are 5--12.6~Myr and $\lesssim$ 5~Myr, respectively. We conclude that, in contrast to the stellar content of Cygnus~OB2, it is unlikely that Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82 are PeVatrons associated with LHAASO~J2108+5157. The presence of a PeVatron in this region remains a mystery, but we confirm that the two Kronberger regions are star--forming regions undergoing formation rather than evolution.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits to the Proper Motions of JuMBO 24, a Jupiter-Mass Binary Object Candidate in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using JWST near-infrared data of the inner Orion Nebula, \citet{Pearson_McCaughrean_2023} detected 40 binary systems they proposed to be Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) -- although their actual nature is still in debate. Only one of the objects, JuMBO\,24, was detected in the radio continuum. Here, we report on new radio continuum (10 GHz) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) detections of the radio counterpart to JuMBO\,24, and on an unsuccessful search for 5 GHz continuum emission with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). From our new VLA detections and adopting a distance to the region, we set an upper limit of $\simeq 6$~km~s$^{-1}$ to the velocity of the radio source in the plane of the sky. This upper limit favors an origin for this source similar to that of stars, that is, from a stationary contracting core. The nature of the radio emission remains uncertain but the lack of strong variability (all VLA observations are consistent with a steady flux of $\sim$50 $\mu$Jy), of detection on long HSA baseline, and of detectable circular polarization in VLA data do not favor a non-thermal origin.</description>

      <title>Temperature anisotropy instabilities of solar wind electrons with regularized Kappa-halos resolved with ALPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space plasmas in various astrophysical setups can often be both very hot and dilute, making them highly susceptible to waves and fluctuations, which are generally self-generated and maintained by kinetic instabilities. In this sense, we have in-situ observational evidence from the solar wind and planetary environments, which reveal not only wave fluctuations at kinetic scales of electrons and protons, but also non-equilibrium distributions of particle velocities. This paper reports on the progress made in achieving a consistent modeling of the instabilities generated by temperature anisotropy, taking concrete example of those induced by anisotropic electrons, such as, electromagnetic electron-cyclotron (whistler) and firehose instabilities. The effects of the two main electron populations, the quasi-thermal core and the suprathermal halo indicated by the observations, are thus captured. The low-energy core is bi-Maxwellian, and the halo is described for the first time by a regularized (bi-)$\kappa$-distribution (RKD), which was recently introduced to fix inconsistencies of standard $\kappa$-distributions (SKD). In the absence of a analytical RKD dispersion kinetic formalism (involving tedious and laborious derivations), both the dispersion and (in)stability properties are directly solved numerically using the numerical Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (ALPS). The results have an increased degree of confidence, considering the successful testing of the ALPS on previous results with established distributions.</description>

      <title>SN 2023vbg: A Type IIn Supernova Resembling SN 2009ip, with a Long-Duration Precursor and Early-Time Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 2009ip (09ip-like SNe) originate from the interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the ejecta. This subclass not only shares similar observational properties around the maximum, but is commonly characterized by a long duration precursor before its maximum. Investigating the observed properties of the precursor provides constraints on the mass-loss history of the progenitor.We present observational data of SN 2023vbg, a 09ip-like type IIn SN that displayed unique observational properties compared to other 09ip-like SNe. SN 2023vbg showed a long-duration precursor at $M_g\sim-14$ mag lasting for $\sim100$ days, followed by a bright bump at $M_g\sim-17$ mag at 12-25 days before the maximum. The luminosity of the precursor is similar to those of other 09ip-like SNe, but the bright bump has not been observed in other cases.After reaching the peak luminosity, the light curve exhibited a peculiar smooth decline.While the H$\alpha$ profile displays two velocity components ($\sim 500$ and $3000\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$), a broad component observed in other 09ip-like SNe was not detected. We suggest that these properties are explained by the difference in the CSM structure as compared to other 09ip-like SNe; SN 2023vbg had an inner denser CSM component, as well as generally smooth CSM density distribution in a more extended scale, than in the others. Such diversity of CSM likely reflects the diversity of pre-SN outbursts, which in turn may mirror the range of evolutionary pathways in the final stages of the progenitors.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}E$ and fallback rate $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A Triple Scenario for the Formation of Wide Black Hole Binaries Such As Gaia BH1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several non-interacting black hole-stellar binaries have been identified in Gaia data. For example, Gaia BH1, where a Sun-like star is in a moderate eccentricity (e=0.44), 185-day orbit around a black hole. This orbit is difficult to explain through binary evolution. The present-day separation suggests the progenitor system would have undergone an episode of common envelope evolution, but a common envelope should shrink the period below the observed one. Since the majority of massive stars form in higher multiplicity systems, a triple evolution scenario is more likely for the progenitors of BH binaries. Here we show that such systems can indeed be more easily explained via evolution in hierarchical triple systems. von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations or instabilities can delay the onset of the common envelope phase in the inner binary of the triple, so that the black hole progenitor and low-mass star are more widely separated when it begins, leading to the formation of wider binaries. There are also systems with similar periods but larger eccentricities, where the BH progenitor is a merger product of the inner binary in the triple. Such mergers lead to a more top-heavy black hole mass function.</description>

      <title>The Legacy of Henrietta Leavitt: A Re-analysis of the First Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.</description>

      <title>A New Formation Mechanism of Counterstreaming Mass Flows in Filaments and the Doppler Bullseye Pattern in Prominences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eruption of solar prominences can eject substantial mass and magnetic field into interplanetary space and cause geomagnetic storms. However, various questions about prominences and their eruption mechanism remain unclear. In particular, what causes the intriguing Doppler bullseye pattern in prominences has not yet been solved, despite some preliminary studies proposing that they are probably associated with counterstreaming mass flows. Previous studies are mainly based on single-angle and short timescale observations, making it difficult to determine the physical origin of Doppler bullseye patterns in prominences. Here, taking advantage of stereoscopic observations taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory and a three-dimensional numerical simulation, we investigate the origin of prominence Doppler bullseye pattern by tracing a long-lived transequatorial filament/prominence from July 23 to August 4, 2012. We find that repeated coronal jets at one end of the prominence can launch the Doppler bullseye pattern. It is evidenced in our observations and simulation that during the forward traveling of jet plasma along the helical magnetic field structure of the prominence, part of the ejecting plasma can not pass through the apex of the prominence due to the insufficient kinetic energy and therefore forms a backward-moving mass flow along the same or neighboring magnetic field lines. This process finally forms counterstreaming mass flows in on-disk filaments. When the on-disk filament rotates to the solar limb to be a prominence, the counterstreaming mass flows are naturally observed as a Doppler bullseye pattern.</description>

      <title>Dust Clumping in Outer Protoplanetary Disks: the Interplay Among Four Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dust concentration in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is the first step towards planetesimal formation, a crucial yet highly uncertain stage in planet formation. Although the streaming instability (SI) is widely recognized as a powerful mechanism for planetesimal formation, its properties can be sensitive to the gas dynamical environment. The outer region of PPDs is subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), which could further induce the Rossby wave instability (RWI) to generate numerous vortices. In this work, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to perform a 3D global simulation with mesh refinement to achieve adequate domain size and resolution to resolve and accommodate all these instabilities. The VSI mainly governs the overall gas dynamics, dominated by the breathing mode due to dust mass loading. The dust strongly settles to the midplane layer, which is much more densely populated with small vortices compared to the dust-free case. Strong dust clumping is observed, which is likely owing to the joint action of the SI and dusty RWI, and those sufficient for planetesimal formation reside only in a small fraction of such vortices. Dust clumping becomes stronger with increasing resolution, and has not yet achieved numerical convergence in our exploration. In addition, we find evidence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) operating at certain parts of the dust-gas interface, which may contribute to the temporary destruction of dust clumps.</description>
