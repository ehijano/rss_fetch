      <title>Quantum Kinetic Modeling of KEEN waves in a Warm-Dense Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a fully kinetic, quantum study of Kinetic Electrostatic Electron Nonlinear (KEEN) waves, showing that quantum diffraction systematically erodes the classical trapping mechanism, narrow harmonic locking to the fundamental, and hasten post-drive decay. Electrons are evolved with a second-order Strang-split 1D1V Wigner-Poisson solver that couples conservative semi-Lagrangian WENO advection to an analytic Fourier space update for the non-local Wigner term, while ions remain classical. Short, frequency-tuned ponderomotive pulses drive KEEN formation in a uniform Maxwellian plasma; as the dimensionless quantum parameter H rises from the classical limit to values relevant to warm-dense matter, doped semiconductors, and 2D electron systems, the drive threshold increases, higher harmonics are damped, trapped electron vortices diffuse, and the subplasma electrostatic energy relaxes to a lower stationary level, as confirmed by continuous wavelet analysis. These microscopic changes carry macroscopic weight. Ignition-scale capsules now compress matter to regimes where the electron de Broglie wavelength rivals the Debye length, making classical kinetic descriptions insufficient. By extending KEEN physics into this quantum domain, our results offer a potential diagnostic of nonequilibrium electron dynamics for next-generation inertial-confinement designs and high-energy-density platforms, indicating that predictive fusion modeling may benefit from the integration of kinetic fidelity with quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Effect of flow-aligned external magnetic fields on mushroom instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mushroom instability (MI) is a shear instability considered responsible for generating and amplifying magnetic fields in relativistic jets. While astrophysical jets are usually considered to be magnetized, how MI acts in magnetized jets remains poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a flow-aligned external magnetic field on MI, with both theoretical analyses and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In the limit of a cold and collisionless plasma, we derive a generalized dispersion relation for linear growth rates of the magnetized MIs. Numerical solutions of the dispersion relation reveal that the external magnetic field always suppresses the growth of MI, though MIs are much more robust to the external magnetic field than electron-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (ESKHIs). Analyses are also extended to instabilities with an arbitrary wavevector in the shear interface plane. Two-dimensional PIC simulations of single-mode MIs reach a good agreement with our analytical predictions. In simulations with finite temperatures, we observe the competition and cooperation between MIs and a diffusion-induced DC magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Visual MARFE Prediction on the HL-3 Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multifaceted Asymmetric Radiation From the Edge (MARFE) is a critical plasma instability that often precedes density-limit disruptions in tokamaks, posing a significant risk to machine integrity and operational efficiency. Early and reliable alert of MARFE formation is therefore essential for developing effective disruption mitigation strategies, particularly for next-generation devices like ITER. This paper presents a novel, physics-informed indicator for early MARFE prediction and disruption warning developed for the HL-3 tokamak. Our framework integrates two core innovations: (1) a high-fidelity label refinement pipeline that employs a physics-scored, weighted Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to systematically correct noise and artifacts in raw visual data from cameras, and (2) a continuous-time, physics-constrained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) model that predicts the short-horizon ``worsening" of a MARFE. By conditioning the model's dynamics on key plasma parameters such as normalized density ($f_G$, derived from core electron density) and core electron temperature ($T_e$), the predictor achieves superior performance in the low-false-alarm regime crucial for control. On a large experimental dataset from HL-3, our model demonstrates high predictive accuracy, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.969 for 40ms-ahead prediction. The indicator has been successfully deployed for real-time operation with updates every 1 ms. This work lays a very foundation for future proactive MARFE mitigation.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Shaping in Wakefield Accelerators due to Betatron Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma-based accelerators are beginning to employ relativistic beams with unprecedented charge and ultrashort durations. These dense driver beams can drive wakes even in high-density plasmas ($\gtrsim10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$), where betatron radiation becomes increasingly important and begins to affect the dynamics of the accelerated beam. In this Letter, we show that betatron cooling leads to a strong, structuring of the phase space of the beam. This gives rise to bunched, ring-like structures with positive radial position and momentum gradients, \emph{i.e.}, population inversion of the amplitude of oscillation. We derive the characteristic timescales for this process analytically and confirm our predictions with multi-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations. The radiation-dominated regime of beam dynamics fundamentally alters the acceleration process and produces self-structured beams capable of triggering coherent betatron emission in ion channels.</description>

      <title>Wave Topology in Hall MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18830v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hall Magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) extends ideal MHD by incorporating the Hall effect via the induction equation, making it more accurate for describing plasma behavior at length scales below the ion skin depth. Despite its importance, a comprehensive description of the eigenmodes in HMHD has been lacking. In this work, we derive the complete spectrum and eigenvectors of HMHD waves and identify their underlying topological structure. We prove that the HMHD wave spectrum is homotopic to that of ideal MHD, consisting of three distinct branches: the slow magnetosonic-Hall waves, the shear Alfv\'en-Hall waves, and the fast magnetosonic-Hall waves, which continuously reduce to their ideal MHD counterparts in the limit of vanishing Hall parameter. Contrary to a recent claim, we find that HMHD does not admit any additional wave branches beyond those in ideal MHD. The key qualitative difference lies in the topological nature of the HMHD wave structure: it exhibits nontrivial topology characterized by a Weyl point-an isolated eigenmode degeneracy point-and associated nonzero Chern numbers of the eigenmode bundles over a 2-sphere in k-space surrounding the Weyl point.</description>

      <title>Laboratory formation of scaled astrophysical outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical systems exhibit a rich diversity of outflow morphologies, yet their mechanisms and existence conditions remain among the most persistent puzzles in the field. Here we present scaled laboratory experiments based on laser-driven plasma outflow into magnetized ambient gas, which mimic five basic astrophysical outflows regulated by interstellar medium, namely collimated jets, blocked jets, elliptical bubbles, as well as spherical winds and bubbles. Their morphologies and existence conditions are found to be uniquely determined by the external Alfvenic and sonic Mach numbers Me-a and Me-s, i.e. the relative strengths of the outflow ram pressure against the magnetic/thermal pressures in the interstellar medium, with transitions occurring at Me-a ~ 2 and 0.5, as well as Me-s ~ 1. These results are confirmed by magnetohydrodynamics simulations and should also be verifiable from existing and future astronomical observations. Our findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding astrophysical outflows.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation to equilibrium distributions in cold dark matter halos: origin of the NFW profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating in the pre-assembled halo develops an $r^{-\gamma}$ inner density cusp, accretion and relaxation in which develops an $r^{-\beta}$ outer fall-off with $\beta \approx 5 - 2\gamma$ in the quasi-steady state. Spherical collapse theory dictates that a quasi-steady outer halo must settle to $\beta \approx 3$, for which the mass enclosed within a shell barely changes with time. This implies that $\gamma\approx 1$, which is possible in the quasilinear framework only if (i) the pre-assembled halo harbors an $r^{-\gamma_{\mathrm{P}}}$ profile with $\gamma_{\mathrm{P}} \gtrsim 0.5$, (ii) its fluctuations are correlated in time (red noise), and (iii) the initial value of $\gamma$ is smaller than $1$, implying that the $r^{-1}$ cusp is a neutral equilibrium. We demonstrate for the first time how the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile emerges as a quasi-steady state of collisionless relaxation.</description>
