      <title>Measuring the Diffuse Interstellar Bands at 5780, 5797 and 6614 {\AA} in Low-Resolution Spectra of Cool Stars from LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We attempt to measure the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in over two million low-resolution spectra of cool stars from LAMOST. Based on the DIB measurements, the correlation between DIBs and extinction, the kinematics of DIBs, and the Galactic distribution of DIBs are reviewed and investigated from the perspective of statistics. A pipeline is developed to measure the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in the LAMOST low-resolution spectra. We obtain the DIB measurements of spectra of late-type stars from LAMOST, and screen out 176,831, 13,473 and 110,152 high-quality (HQ) measurements of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614, respectively, corresponding to 142,074, 11,480 and 85,301 unique sources. Utilizing these HQ measurements, we present the Galactic maps of the DIBs $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$6614 in the northern sky for the first time. The central wavelengths of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in air are determined to be 5780.48 $\pm$ 0.01, 5796.94 $\pm$ 0.02 and 6613.64 $\pm$ 0.01 {\AA}, respectively, based on their kinematics. The equivalent widths of these three DIBs per unit extinction are statistically fitted to be 0.565, 0.176 and 0.256 {\AA}/mag. As a part of our work, three catalogs of the HQ measurements for the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 are provided online. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number of measurements of these three DIBs to date. It is also the first time that the Galactic maps of the DIBs $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$6614 in the northern hemisphere are presented, and the central wavelengths of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 are estimated from the kinematics.</description>

      <title>Multifractality of complex networks is also due to geometry. The Geometric SandBox algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, describing the reality surrounding us using the language of complex networks has become very useful and therefore popular. One of the most important features, especially of real networks, is their complexity, which often manifests itself in a fractal or even multifractal structure. As a generalisation of fractal analysis, multifractal analysis of complex networks is a useful tool for the identification and quantitative description of the spatial hierarchy of both theoretical and numerical fractal patterns. Nowadays, there are many methods of multifractal analysis. However, all these methods take into account only the fact of connection between nodes (and eventually the weight of edges) and do not take into account the real positions (coordinates) of nodes in space. However, intuition suggests that the geometry of network nodes' position should have a significant impact on its true fractal structure. Many networks identified in nature (e.g. air connection networks, energy networks, social networks, mountain ridge networks, networks of neurones in the brain, street networks) have their own often unique and characteristic geometry, which is not taken into account in the identification process of multifractality in commonly used methods. In this paper, we propose a multifractal network analysis method that takes into account both connections between nodes and the location coordinates of nodes (network geometry). We show the results for different geometrical variants of the same network and reveal that this method, contrary to the commonly used method, is sensitive to changes in network geometry. We carry out tests for synthetic as well as for real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of personal relationships remain largely unexplored due to the inherent difficulties of the longitudinal data collection process. In this paper, we analyse a dataset tracking the temporal evolution of a network of personal relationships among 900 people over the course of four years. We search for evidence that the network is in equilibrium, meaning that all macroscopic properties remain constant, fluctuating around stable values, while the internal microscopic dynamics are active. We find that the probabilities governing the network dynamics are stationary over time and that the degree distributions, as well as edge and triangle abundances match the theoretical equilibrium distributions expected under these dynamics. Furthermore, we verify that the system satisfies the detailed balance condition, with only minor point deviations, confirming that it is indeed in equilibrium. Remarkably, this equilibrium persists despite a high turnover in network composition, suggesting that it is an inherent characteristic of human social interactions rather than a trait of the individuals themselves. We argue that this equilibrium may be a general feature of human social networks arising from the competition between different dynamical mechanisms and also from the cognitive and material resources management of individuals. From a practical perspective, the fact that networks are in equilibrium could simplify data collection processes, validate the use of cross-sectional data-based methods like Exponential Random Graph Models, and inform the design of interventions. Our findings advance the understanding of collective human behaviour predictability and our ability to describe it using simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of structural dynamics with neural operators enabled surrogate modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation generally involves inferring the values of mathematical models derived from first principles or expert knowledge, which is challenging for complex structural systems. In this work, we present a unified deep learning-based framework for parameterization, forward modeling, and inverse modeling of structural dynamics. The parameterization is flexible and can be user-defined, including physical and/or non-physical (customized) parameters. In forward modeling, we train a neural operator for response prediction -- forming a surrogate model, which leverages the defined system parameters and excitation forces as inputs. The inverse modeling focuses on estimating system parameters. In particular, the learned forward surrogate model (which is differentiable) is utilized for preliminary parameter estimation via gradient-based optimization; to further boost the parameter estimation, we introduce a neural refinement method to mitigate ill-posed problems, which often occur in the former. The framework's effectiveness is verified numerically and experimentally, in both interpolation and extrapolation cases, indicating its capability to capture intrinsic dynamics of structural systems from both forward and inverse perspectives. Moreover, the framework's flexibility is expected to support a wide range of applications, including surrogate modeling, structural identification, damage detection, and inverse design of structural systems.</description>

      <title>The Jaccard Similarity Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arithmetic mean plays a central role in science and technology, being directly related to the concepts of statistical expectance and centrality. Yet, it is highly susceptible to the presence of outliers or biased interference in the original dataset to which it is applied. Described recently, the concept of similarity means has been preliminary found to have marked robustness to those same effects, especially when adopting the Jaccard similarity index. The present work is aimed at investigating further the properties of similarity means, especially regarding their range, translating and scaling properties, sensitivity and robustness to outliers. Several interesting contributions are reported, including an effective algorithm for obtaining the similarity mean, the analytic and experimental identification of a number of properties, as well as the confirmation of the potential stability of the similarity mean to the presence of outliers. The present work also describes an application case-example in which the Jaccard similarity is successfully employed to study cycles of sunspots, with interesting results.</description>
