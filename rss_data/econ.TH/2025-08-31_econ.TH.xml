      <title>Contrarian Motives in Social Learning: Information Cascades with Nonconformist Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embed a taste for nonconformism into a canonical Bikhchandani-Hirshleifer-Welch social-learning model. Agents value both correctness and choosing the minority action (fixed or proportion-based bonus). We study exogenous signals and endogenous acquisition with a fixed entry cost and convex cost of precision in a Gaussian-quadratic specification. Contrarian motives shift equilibrium cutoffs away from 1/2 and expand the belief region where information is purchased, sustaining informative actions; conditional on investing, chosen precision is lower near central beliefs. Welfare is shaped by a trade-off: mild contrarianism counteracts premature herding, whereas strong contrarianism steers actions against informative social signals and induces low-value experimentation. A tractable characterization delivers closed-form cutoffs, comparative statics, and transparent welfare comparisons. Applications include scientific priority races and academic diffusion, where distinctiveness yields rents yet excessive contrarianism erodes information aggregation.</description>

      <title>A Non-Parametric Approach to Heterogeneity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a non-parametric methodology to quantify preference heterogeneity in consumer choices. By repeatedly sampling individual observations and partitioning agents into groups consistent with the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences (GARP), we construct a similarity matrix capturing latent preference structures. Under mild assumptions, this matrix consistently and asymptotically normally estimates the probability that any pair of agents share a common utility function. Leveraging this, we develop hypothesis tests to assess whether demographic characteristics systematically explain unobserved heterogeneity. Simulations confirm the test's validity. Applying the method to grocery expenditure data, we find robust evidence that larger families, higher income, and younger age are associated with greater similarity in revealed preferences, whereas low income and older age predict lower similarity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Delegation with Reputation Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dynamic delegation with reputation feedback: a long-lived expert advises a sequence of implementers whose effort responds to current reputation, altering outcome informativeness and belief updates. We solve for a recursive, belief-based equilibrium and show that advice is a reputation-dependent cutoff in the expert's signal. A diagnosticity condition - failures at least as informative as successes - implies reputational conservatism: the cutoff (weakly) rises with reputation. Comparative statics are transparent: greater private precision or a higher good-state prior lowers the cutoff, whereas patience (value curvature) raises it. Reputation is a submartingale under competent types and a supermartingale under less competent types; we separate boundary hitting into learning (news generated infinitely often) versus no-news absorption. A success-contingent bonus implements any target experimentation rate with a plug-in calibration in a Gaussian benchmark. The framework yields testable predictions and a measurement map for surgery (operate vs. conservative care).</description>

      <title>Risky Advice and Reputational Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study expert advice under reputational incentives, with sell-side equity research as the lead application. A long-lived analyst receives a continuous private signal about a binary payoff and recommends a risky (Buy) or safe action. Recommendations and outcomes are public, and clients' implementation effort depends on current reputation. In a recursive, belief-based equilibrium: (i) advice follows a cutoff in the signal; (ii) under a simple diagnosticity asymmetry, the cutoff is (weakly) increasing in reputation (reputational conservatism); and (iii) comparative statics are transparent - higher signal precision or a higher success prior lowers the cutoff, whereas stronger career concerns raise it. A success-contingent bonus implements any target experimentation rate via a closed-form mapping. The model predicts that high-reputation analysts make fewer risky calls yet attain higher conditional hit rates, and it clarifies how committee thresholds and monitoring regimes shift behavior.</description>
