      <title>First Passage Problem: Asymptotic Corrections due to Discrete Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How long a stochastic process survives before leaving a domain depends not only on its intrinsic dynamics but also on how it is observed. Classical first-passage theory assumes continuous monitoring with absorbing boundaries (``kill-on-touch''). In practice, however, measurements are often taken at discrete times. Between two checks, a trajectory may leave and re-enter the domain without being detected. Under this \emph{stroboscopic} rule (``kill-on-check''), exit statistics change qualitatively.
  We analyze one-dimensional Brownian motion confined to an interval of length $L$ and observed at frame intervals~$\Delta t$, with diffusive step scale $\sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}$. The dynamics collapse onto a single confinement ratio $\rho=L/(\sigma\sqrt{\Delta t})$. For boundary starts we obtain linear scaling of the mean number of frames until exit, while for bulk starts the survival is governed by the spectral gap of a one-step stroboscopic operator, leading to a quadratic law with linear corrections. These results identify the stroboscopic first-passage problem where the observation protocol itself reshapes the statistics of escape.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of quantizations of the dispersionless KdV hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wang recently constructed a quantization of the dispersionless KdV hierarchy using the Heisenberg vertex algebra. Independently, in joint work with Rossi, we obtained a quantization of the dispersionless KdV hierarchy as the trivial Cohomological Field Theory case of the meromorphic differential hierarchies. In this note, we prove that the two constructions coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holding a shell in their hands, one can apply six loads: three by pulling and shearing, and three by bending and twisting. Here, it is shown that the shell will resist exactly three load cases and comply with the other three, provided the shell is simply connected, meaning it has no holes and no handles.</description>

      <title>Area Law for the entanglement entropy of free fermions in nonrandom ergodic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with the asymptotic behavior of one of the widely used characteristics of correlations in large quantum systems. The correlations are known as quantum entanglement, the characteristic is called the entanglement entropy, and as large systems we consider an ideal gas of spinless lattice fermions. The system is determined by its one-body Hamiltonian. As shown in \cite{EPS}, if the Hamiltonian is an ergodic finite difference operator with exponentially decaying spectral projection, then the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy is the so-called Area Law. However, the only one-body Hamiltonian for which this spectral condition is verified is the $d$-dimensional discrete Schr\"odinger operators with random potential. In the present paper, we prove that the same asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy holds for a wide class of Schr\"odinger operators whose potentials are ergodic but nonrandom. We start with the quasiperiodic and limit periodic operators, and then pass to the interesting and highly non-trivial case of the potentials generated by subshifts of finite type. They arose in the theory of dynamical systems in the study of non-random chaotic phenomena. As it turns out, obtaining the asymptotics of the entanglement entropy of free fermions requires a quite involved spectral analysis of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. Specifically, we prove for this class two important and interesting in itself spectral properties, known as exponential dynamic localisation in expectation and the exponential decay of the eigenfunction correlator, implying the Area Law for the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>On the construction of Hadamard states from Feynman propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wightman two-point function of any Hadamard state of a linear quantum field theory determines a corresponding Feynman propagator. Conversely, however, a Feynman propagator determines a state only if certain positivity conditions are fulfilled. We point out that the construction of a state from a Feynman propagator involves a slightly subtle point that we address and resolve. Starting from a recent generalisation of the Duistermaat-H\"ormander theory of distinguished parametrices to normally hyperbolic and Dirac-type operators acting on sections of hermitian vector bundles, we complete this work by showing how Feynman propagators can be chosen so as to define Hadamard states. The theories considered are: the complex bosonic field governed by a normally hyperbolic operator; the corresponding hermitian theory if the operator commutes with a complex conjugation; the Dirac fermionic theory governed by a Dirac-type operator, and the corresponding Majorana theory in the case where the operator commutes with a skew complex conjugation. The additional key ingredients that we supply are simple domination properties of self-adjoint smooth kernels.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the propagation of harmonic and transient waves for systems governed by a wave equation with memory whose integral kernel involves ratios of modified Bessel functions of the first kind in the Laplace domain. In particular, the investigation of transient waves is carried out by means of a fully numerical approach based on the Talbot method for the numerical inversion of Laplace transforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a discrete version of the non-abelian X-ray transform, going back in particular to Manakov, Zakharov (1981) and Strichartz (1982). We extend to this transform non-overdetermined reconstruction results obtained for the abelian case in the recent article by Novikov, Sharma (2025). In addition, we establish relations with the continuous non-abelian X-ray transform. In this respect, our results include an explicit and exact non-overdetermined layer-stripping reconstruction procedure for piecewise constant matrix-valued functions from their continuous non-abelian X-ray transform. To our knowledge, this result is new even for the classical X-ray transform.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the wave equation with Dirac damping on a compact star graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the wave equation with a distributional Dirac damping and Dirichlet boundary conditions on a compact interval. It is shown that the spectrum of the corresponding wave operator is fully determined by zeroes of an entire function. Consequently, a considerable change of spectral properties is shown for certain critical values of the damping parameter. We also derive a definitive criterion for the Riesz basis property of the root vectors for an arbitrary placement of a complex-valued Dirac damping. Finally, we consider a generalisation of the problem for compact star graphs and provide insight into the essence of the critical damping constant.</description>

      <title>Analytic results in conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09868v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the 1980s, many exact results have been discovered in $2d$ CFT, from critical exponents to correlation functions to complete solutions of certain models. In $d&gt;2$, there is a wealth of numerical results as well as promising analytic approaches, but comparably fewer exact answers.
  The aim of this conference was to review the most promising analytic methods and results in CFT in any dimension. In particular we tried to understand to which extent the $2d$ methods can be extended to $d&gt;2$, and what is missing to exactly solve $d&gt;2$ CFTs.</description>

      <title>Weyl symmetry without the traceless condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the requirement that the trace of the stress-energy tensor of matter must vanish if invariance under Weyl rescalings is a symmetry of a given gravitational theory, is not a general result but depends on the gravitational theory and on whether the matter action is form-invariant under Weyl rescalings or not. We focus on conformal general relativity with a Weyl form-invariant matter action. In this case, a linear dependence of the variations of the metric and of the Brans-Dicke scalar field arises, which is a direct consequence of invariance under infinitesimal Weyl rescalings. We demonstrate how to apply the variational procedure properly and obtain the correct equations of motion. It results that the Klein-Gordon type equation for the Brans-Dicke scalar coincides with the trace of the Einstein-type equation of motion. In consequence, any matter fields, no matter whether the trace of their stress-energy tensor vanishes or not, can be coupled to gravity. The phenomenological consequences of the modified result are drawn.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Love number of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10036v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformation of compact objects, characterised by their Love numbers, provides insights into the internal structure of neutron stars and black holes. While bosonic tidal Love numbers vanish for black holes in general relativity, it has been recently revealed that fermionic tidal perturbations can induce non-zero Love numbers for Kerr black holes. In this paper, we investigate the response of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to the fermionic Weyl field. As a result, we find that the corresponding fermionic tidal Love numbers are also non-vanishing for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes except for the extremal ones, which highlights the universal distinct behavior of the fermionic tidal Love numbers compared to the bosonic counterparts.</description>

      <title>An efficient spectral Poisson solver for the nirvana-III code: the shearing-box case with vertical vacuum boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of a differentially rotating fluid subject to its own gravity is a problem with applications across wide areas of astrophysics--from protoplanetary discs (PPDs) to entire galaxies. The shearing box formalism offers a conceptually simple framework for studying differential rotation in the local approximation. Aimed at self-gravitating, and importantly, vertically stratified PPDs, we develop two novel methods for solving Poisson's equation in the framework of the shearing box with vertical vacuum boundary conditions (BCs). Both approaches naturally make use of multi-dimensional fast Fourier transforms for computational efficiency. While the first one exploits the linearity properties of the Poisson equation, the second, which is slightly more accurate, consists of finding the adequate discrete Green's function (in Fourier space) adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, we have revisited the method proposed by Vico et al. (2016) and have derived an analytical Green's function satisfying the shear-periodic BCs in the plane as well as vacuum BCs, vertically. Our spectral method demonstrates excellent accuracy, even with a modest number of grid points, and exhibits third-order convergence. It has been implemented in the NIRVANA-III code, where it exhibits good scalability up to 4096 CPU cores, consuming less than 6% of the total runtime. This was achieved through the use of P3DFFT, a fast Fourier Transform library that employs pencil decomposition, overcoming the scalability limitations inherent in libraries using slab decomposition. We have introduced two novel spectral Poisson solvers that guarantees high accuracy, performance, and intrinsically support vertical vacuum boundary conditions in the shearing-box framework. Our solvers enable high-resolution local studies involving self-gravity, such as MHD simulations of gravito-turbulence or gravitational fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Inspiral Transition and Induction to Plunge of a Compact Body in Equatorial Plane Around a Massive Kerr Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reconstructs the derivation process from the Kerr metric to the adiabatic inspiral, transition, and plunge regimes, aiming to highlight the details and logical connections often overlooked in previous derivations. The first half provides a comprehensive roadmap for readers familiar with advanced general relativity to follow the entire logic of the inspiral-transition-plunge regime from this paper alone. The second half addresses the discontinuity between the adiabatic inspiral and the plunge, including analyses and reinterpretations of the Ori-Thorne and Ori-Thorne-Kesden transition procedures, and proposes two new interpretations: a variant of the Kesden Y-correction and the Adiabatic Inspiral Perturbation-Induced Plunge. The paper also introduces the concept of the Most Stable Circular Orbit (MSCO) and analyzes its properties as a characteristic radius of Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>A continued fraction approximation for the effective elasticity tensor of two-dimensional polycrystals as a function of the crystal elasticity tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For two-dimensional polycrystals the effective elasticity tensor $C_*$ as a function $C_*(C_0)$ of the elasticity tensor $C_0$ of the constituent crystal is considered. It is shown that this function can be approximated by one with a continued fraction expansion resembling that associated with a class of microstructure known as sequential laminates. These are hierarchical microstructures defined inductively. Rank 0 sequential laminates are simply rotations of the pure crystal. Rank $j$ sequential laminates are obtained by laminating together, on a length scale much larger that the existing microstructure and with interfaces perpendicular to some direction $n_j$, rank $j-1$ sequential laminates with a rotation of the pure crystal. The continued fraction approximation for arbitrary polycrystal microstructures typically takes a more general form than that of sequential laminates, but has some free parameters. It is an open question as to whether these free parameters can always be adjusted so the continued fraction approximation matches exactly that of a sequential laminate. If so, one would have established that the elastic response of two-dimensional polycrystals can always be mimicked by that of sequential laminates. Our analysis carries over to the more general case where the strain is replaced by a field $E(x)$ that is the gradient of a vector potential $u(x)$, i.e. $E=\nabla u$ and the stress is replaced by a matrix valued field $J(x)$ that need not be symmetric but has zero divergence $\nabla\cdot J=0$. The tensor $L(x)$ entering the constitutive relation $J=L E$ is locally a rotation of the tensor $L_0$ of the pure crystal that need not have any special symmetries and has 16 independent tensor elements.</description>

We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a special family of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle (OPUC). These OPUC satisfy a mirror symmetry property of their Verblunsky coefficients. Several equivalent conditions for the OPUC to be mirror symmetric are presented. Corresponding unitary CMV matrices satisfy simple algebraic relations similar to relations for persymmetric tridiagonal matrices. We present three explicit examples of mirror symmetric OPUC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the polyatomic Boltzmann equation based on continuous internal energy, focusing on physically relevant collision kernels of the hard potentials type with integrable angular part. We establish three main results: smoothing effects of the gain collision operator, propagation of velocity and internal energy first-order derivatives of solutions, and exponential decay estimates for singularities of the initial data. These results ultimately lead to a decomposition theorem, showing that any solution splits into a smooth part and a rapidly decaying rough component.</description>

      <title>Determining nonlinear balance laws in product-type domains by a single local passive boundary observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-theoretic paradigm for solving inverse problems in nonlinear balance laws, shifting the focus from identifying specific functional forms to recovering the input-output actions of the associated flux and source operators. It is established that a single local passive boundary observation suffices to uniquely determine realizations of these operators for systems posed on product-type domains. This framework, which encompasses dynamical regimes, reveals a holographic-type principle where macroscopic boundary data encodes microscopic dynamical information, with broad implications for fluid dynamics and reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>A proof of Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture for WRT invariants of Seifert fibered homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a general Seifert fibered integral homology $3$-sphere with $r\ge3$ exceptional fibers. For every root of unity $\zeta\not=1$, we show that the SU(2) WRT invariant of $X$ evaluated at $\zeta$ is (up to an elementary factor) the non-tangential limit at $\zeta$ of the GPPV invariant of $X$, thereby generalizing a result from [Andersen-Mistegard 2022]. Based on this result, we apply the quantum modularity results developed in [Han-Li-Sauzin-Sun 2023] to the GPPV invariant of $X$ to prove Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture [Witten 1989] for the WRT invariant of $X$. We also prove that the GPPV invariant of $X$ induces a higher depth strong quantum modular form. Moreover, when suitably normalized, the GPPV invariant provides an ``analytic incarnation'' of the Habiro invariant.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Dynamical Analysis of Fractional Discrete Laplacians on the Half-Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate discrete fractional Laplacians defined on the half-lattice in several dimensions, allowing possibly different fractional orders along each coordinate direction. By expressing the half-lattice operator as a boundary restriction of the full-lattice one plus a bounded correction that is relatively compact with respect to it, we show that both operators share the same essential spectrum and the same interior threshold structure. For perturbations by a decaying potential, the conjugate-operator method provides a strict Mourre estimate on any compact energy window inside the continuous spectrum, excluding threshold points. As a consequence, a localized Limiting Absorption Principle holds, ensuring the absence of singular continuous spectrum, the finiteness of eigenvalues, and weighted propagation (transport) bounds. The form-theoretic construction also extends naturally to negative fractional orders. Overall, the relative compactness of the boundary correction guarantees that the interior-energy spectral and dynamical results obtained on the full lattice remain valid on the half-lattice without modification.</description>

Abstract: For a finite group $G$, and level $\alpha\in Z^3(BG;{\rm U}(1))$, Freed and Quinn construct a line bundle over the moduli space of $G$-bundles on surfaces. Global sections determine the values of Chern--Simons theory at level $\alpha$ on surfaces. In this paper, we provide an alternate construction using tools from higher geometry: the pair $(G,\alpha)$ determines a 2-group group, and the Freed--Quinn line arises as a categorical truncation of the bicategory of 2-group bundles.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases on spherical Fermi surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the description of a Fermi gas of free electrons given by the Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation, and aim at providing a precise mathematical understanding of the Fermi ground state and its first-order approximation of excited states on the Fermi sphere.
  In order to achieve that, using the framework of hydrodynamic limits in collisional kinetic theory, we identify the low-temperature regimes in which charge-density fluctuations concentrate on the Fermi sphere. In three spatial dimensions or higher, we also characterize the thermodynamic equilibra and energy spectra of fluctuations. This allows us to derive the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations describing how charge densities flow and propagate in metals, thereby providing a precise description of plasma oscillations in conductors. The two-dimensional case is fundamentally different and is handled in a companion article.
  Remarkably, our results establish that excited electrons and their energy can be distributed on the Fermi sphere anisotropically, which deviates from the common intuitive assumption that electrons and their energy should be distributed uniformly in all directions.
  The hydrodynamic regimes featured in this work are akin to the acoustic limit of the classical Boltzmann equation. However, we emphasize that our derivation holds for arbitrarily fast rates of convergence of the Knudsen number, which significantly extends the applicability of the known proofs of the classical acoustic limit. This suggest that low-temperature limits of Fermi gases provide a promising avenue of research toward a complete understanding of the compressible Euler limit.</description>

      <title>Analysis of bio-nanofluid flow over a stretching sheet with slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A viscous, incompressible, micropolar bio-nanofluid flowing across a stretching sheet in three dimensions while being driven to convect several slip boundaries in the presence of a magnetic field was studied. With the assistance of the relevant transformations, a mathematical model is presented. The finite difference method numerically solves the converted non-linear ordinary differential equations. A comprehensive assessment was conducted to examine the impact of governing parameters on dimensionless velocity, micro-rotation, temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, microorganisms, and heat transfer rate. The findings of this investigation showed a strong correlation when compared to previous studies, indicating a high level of agreement and consistency between the results. The study's conclusions indicate that the velocity profile increases with higher values of {\lambda} and {\delta}, while it decreases with higher values of A, {\delta}v, and M. The micro-rotation profile F({\eta}) drops as the spin gradient viscosity parameter rises, but G({\eta}) increases. The temperature profile decreases with higher Prandtl numbers but increases with higher thermophoresis parameters. The concentration profile decreases with higher Schmidt numbers and Brownian motion parameters. The microorganism profile increases with higher Peclet numbers and microorganism slip parameters but decreases with higher bio-convection Schmidt numbers. Lastly, the local Nusselt number grows with increasing values of the stretching parameter {\lambda}.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical investigation of heat transfer of porous fin in a local thermal non-equilibrium state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research employs a local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model to analyze the heat transfer phenomenon through a porous fin, considering natural convection and radiation effects. The infiltration velocity within the porous medium is evaluated using the Darcy model, and buoyancy effects are accounted for using the Boussinesq approximation. The Akbari-Ganji method (AGM) is applied to address the governing energy equations. The accuracy of the proposed solution is verified by comparing it with numerical results obtained from the finite difference method (FDM), the finite element method (FEM), and earlier investigations. The results are presented regarding the total average Nusselt number and temperature profiles. These results shed light on the influence of several important parameters, such as the thermal conductivity ratio, dimensionless thickness, convectional heat transfer, and external and internal radiation. The analysis reveals that decreasing Rayleigh and Biot numbers reduces the temperature profiles of the solid phase. Additionally, when the Rayleigh number is low but the assigned Biot number is high, the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases diminishes. Furthermore, increased thermal conductivity ratio and dimensionless thickness for assigned Biot and Rayleigh numbers lead to higher solid phase temperatures. The Nusselt number exhibits a decreasing trend with a decreasing thermal conductivity ratio but increases with higher Rayleigh and Biot numbers and increased external radiation.</description>

Abstract: We prove a sharp Weyl estimate for the number of eigenvalues belonging to a fixed interval of energy of a self-adjoint difference operator acting on $\ell^2(\epsilon\mathbb{Z}^d)$ if the associated symplectic volume of phase space in ${\mathbb R}^d \times {\mathbb T}^d$ accessible for the Hamiltonian flow of the principal symbol is finite. Here $\epsilon$ is a semiclassical parameter. Our proof depends crucially on the construction of a good semiclassical approximation for the time evolution induced by the self-adjoint operator on $\ell^2(\epsilon \mathbb{Z}^d)$. This extends previous semiclassical results to a broad class of difference operators on a scaled lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on recent advances in fibration symmetry theory, we investigate how structural symmetries influence synchronization in systems with higher-order interactions (HOI). Using bipartite graph representations, we identify a node partition in fibres, based on equivalent incidence relations in hypergraphs. We study how identical nodes with an isomorphic input set can synchronize due to structural properties under our specific model assumptions, examining the dynamical model of Kuramoto with higher-order interactions and frustration parameters. Recent works established for directed hypergraphs that balanced partitions characterize robust synchrony, invariant under all admissible dynamics, whereas our contribution isolates the case of Kuramoto dynamics and shows that synchrony under homogeneous initial conditions and natural frequencies necessarily coincides with the fibration partition. As a conclusion, let us examine situations that require adjustments to the hypergraph topology to handle redundancy or to align with a target cluster configuration, especially in the presence of noise or incomplete information. These considerations open up new questions for future investigations. Our methodology combines theoretical modeling and simulations with applications to real-world data topologies, highlighting how representational choices and local input equivalence influence synchronization behavior.</description>

      <title>A minimal and universal representation of fermionic wavefunctions (fermions = bosons + one)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing fermionic wavefunctions efficiently is a central problem in quantum physics, chemistry and materials science. In this work, we introduce a universal and exact representation of continuous antisymmetric functions by lifting them to continuous symmetric functions defined on an enlarged space. Building on this lifting, we obtain a \emph{parity-graded representation} of fermionic wavefunctions, expressed in terms of symmetric feature variables that encode particle configuration and antisymmetric feature variables that encode exchange statistics. This representation is both exact and minimal: the number of required features scales as $D\sim N^d$ ($d$ is spatial dimension) or $D\sim N$ depending on the symmetric feature maps employed. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for efficient representations of fermionic wavefunctions and enable scalable and systematically improvable neural network solvers for many-electron systems.</description>

Abstract: One key theme of Basil Hiley's work was the development of David Bohm's approach to Quantum Mechanics; in particular the concept of the quantum potential. Another theme was the importance of Clifford Algebras in fundamental physics. In this paper I will combine these approaches by looking at how the quantum potential can be extended to the Dirac equation. I will begin by discussing the geometry of the Dirac equation, and how this is made clearer by the use of Clifford algebras .Next, I will rewrite the Cl(2) Dirac wavefunction in Polar form, and show that new behaviour arises due to topological nonlocality. Finally, I discuss the relationship between the Dirac and Schroedinger equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a geometric Satake equivalence for affine Kac-Moody groups as an equivalence of abelian semisimple categories over algebraically closed fields. We define a well-behaved category of equivariant sheaves on the double affine grassmannian \Gr_{G}, seen as a infty-stack, that we equip with a t-structure. We obtain an Braden's hyperbolic localization theorem for such a stack and prove that the constant term functor is t-exact using dimension estimates for affine MV-cycles. We then deduce the sought-for equivalence and prove that the IC-complexes match with the irreducible highest weight representations of the Langlands dual group G^{\vee}.</description>

      <title>Invariant volume form for 3D QRT maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we proposed a three-dimensional generalization of QRT maps. These novel maps can be associated with pairs of pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. By construction, these maps have two rational integrals (parameters of both pencils). In the present paper, we find an invariant volume form for these maps, thus finally establishing their integrability.</description>

      <title>An adaptive time-stepping strategy for the modified phase field crystal model with a strong nonlinear vacancy potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops three linear and energy-stable schemes for a modified phase field crystal model with a strong nonlinear vacancy potential (VMPFC model). This sixth-order phase-field model enables realistic crystal growth simulation. Starting from a Crank-Nicolson scheme based on the stabilized-SAV (S-SAV) method, we optimize it via the generalized positive auxiliary variable (GPAV) and modified exponential scalar auxiliary variable (ESAV) methods, thereby reducing computational complexity or eliminating the requirement for the nonlinear free energy potential to be bounded from below. The newly developed Energy-Variation Moving Average (EV-MA) adaptive time-stepping strategy resolves numerical instabilities and mitigates the high parameter sensitivity of the conventional adaptive time algorithm during rapid energy decay in the strongly nonlinear system. Unlike conventional instantaneous energy-derivative monitors, the EV-MA technique incorporates a moving average of the energy variation. Additionally, the rate of change between adjacent time steps is constrained by a maximum change factor. This design effectively dampens spurious oscillations and enhances the robustness of time step selection. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy and energy stability of the proposed schemes. The EV-MA strategy is also demonstrated to perform robustly across a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Networks Multiscale Entropy Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structural complexity and predictability of complex networks is a central challenge in network science. Although recent studies have revealed a relationship between compression-based entropy and link prediction performance, existing methods focus on single-scale representations. This approach often overlooks the rich hierarchical patterns that can exist in real-world networks. In this study, we introduce a multiscale entropy framework that extends previous entropy-based approaches by applying spectral graph reduction. This allows us to quantify how structural entropy evolves as the network is gradually coarsened, capturing complexity across multiple scales. We apply our framework to real-world networks across biological, economic, social, technological, and transportation domains. The results uncover consistent entropy profiles across network families, revealing three structural regimes$\unicode{x2013}$stable, increasing, and hybrid$\unicode{x2013}$that align with domain-specific behaviors. Compared to single-scale models, multiscale entropy significantly improves our ability to determine network predictability. This shows that considering structural information across scales provides a more complete characterization of network complexity. Together, these results position multiscale entropy as a powerful and scalable tool for characterizing, classifying, and assessing the structure of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Vandermonde Cells Through the Lens of Positive Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric and algebraic structure of Vandermonde cells, defined as images of the standard probability simplex under the Vandermonde map given by consecutive power sum polynomials. Motivated by their combinatorial equivalence to cyclic polytopes, which are well-known examples of positive geometries and tree amplituhedra, we investigate whether Vandermonde cells admit the structure of positive geometries. We derive explicit parametrizations and algebraic equations for their boundary components, extending known results from the planar case to arbitrary dimensions. By introducing a mild generalization of the notion of positive geometry, allowing singularities within boundary interiors, we show that planar Vandermonde cells naturally fit into this extended framework. Furthermore, we study Vandermonde cells in the setting of Brown-Dupont's mixed Hodge theory formulation of positive geometries, and show that they form a genus zero pair.
  These results provide a new algebraic and geometric understanding of Vandermonde cells, establishing them as promising examples within the emerging theory of positive geometries.</description>

      <title>Electric potentials and field lines for uniformly-charged tube and cylinder expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function and integration of $Z(u|m) \mathrm{sc}(u|m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11693v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas. In the Addendum appended after the main article, several relevant references are provided and the decomposition of the solution by ``degrees of transcendence'' is proposed. The attached supplementary calculations provide detailed derivations of several formulas including the integral in the title and discuss the resemblance between the field line potential for tube and the electric potential for disk.</description>

      <title>On novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional non-conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional systems including two well-known systems describing the three-wave-interaction problem and some well-known chaotic systems, namely, the Chen, L\"u, and Qi systems. We show that all of these systems can be described in a Hamiltonian framework in which the Poisson matrix $\mathcal{J}$ is supplemented by a resistance matrix $\mathcal{R}$. While such resistive-Hamiltonian systems are manifestly non-conservative, we construct higher-degree Poisson matrices via the Jordan product as $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{J} \mathcal{R} + \mathcal{R} \mathcal{J}$, thereby leading to new bi-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we discuss conformal Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds and demonstrate that by appropriately choosing the underlying parameters, the reduced three-wave-interaction model as well as the Chen and L\"u systems can be described in this manner where the concomitant non-conservative part of the dynamics is described with the aid of the Euler vector field.</description>

      <title>A study of path measures based on second-order Hamilton--Jacobi equations and their applications in stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic investigation of the mathematical structure of path measures and their profound connections to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) through the framework of second-order Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equations. This approach establishes a unified methodology for analyzing large deviation principles (LDPs), entropy minimization, entropy production, and inverse learning problems in stochastic systems. The second-order HJ equations are shown to play a central role in bridging stochastic dynamics and measure theory while forming the foundation of stochastic geometric mechanics and their applications in stochastic thermodynamics.
  The large deviation rate function is rigorously derived from the probabilistic structure of path measures and demonstrated to be equivalent to the Onsager--Machlup functional of stochastic gradient systems coupled with second-order HJ equations. We revisit entropy minimization problems, including finite time horizon problems and Schr\"{o}dinger's problem, demonstrating the connections with stochastic geometric mechanics. In the context of stochastic thermodynamics, we present a novel decomposition of entropy production, revealing that thermodynamic irreversibility can be interpreted as the difference of the corresponding forward and backward second-order HJ equations. Furthermore, we tackle the challenging problem of identifying stochastic gradient systems from observed most probable paths by reformulating the original nonlinear and non-convex problem into a linear and convex framework through a second-order HJ equation. Together, this work establishes a comprehensive mathematical study of the relations between path measures and stochastic dynamical systems, and their diverse applications in stochastic thermodynamics and beyond.</description>

Abstract: We propose and study blowup relations obeyed by the partition functions of $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ (quiver) SYM theories with $SU(2)$ gauge group and four flavours. By analyzing the Weyl group action on the sets of blowup relations, we identify the integer parameters of a blowup relation with the weights of a corresponding Lie algebra. We also explain how this action of the Weyl group follows from the Weyl group symmetry of the partition function. Finally, we use these relations to derive bilinear relations on the $q$-Painlev\'e VI tau functions.</description>

      <title>A dynamical approach to studying the Lee-Yang zeros for the Potts Model on the Cayley Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Z_n(z,t)$ denote the partition function of the $q$-state Potts Model on the rooted binary Cayley tree of depth~$n$. Here, $z = {\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \in \mathbb{R}$, $T &gt; 0$, and $J \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \in (0,\infty)$ and $z \in (0,\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ and fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J &gt; 0$ or equivalently $t \in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J &lt; 0$ or equivalently $t \in (1,\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two.
  These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by M\"uller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0912</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.0912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between gauge and gravity amounts to understanding underlying new geometrical local structures. These structures are new tetrads specially devised for Yang-Mills theories, Abelian and Non-Abelian in four-dimensional Lorentzian curved spacetimes. In the present manuscript a new tetrad is introduced for the Yang- Mills SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) formulation. These new tetrads establish a link between local groups of gauge transformations and local groups of spacetime transformations that we previously called LB1 and LB2. New theorems are proved regarding isomorphisms between local internal SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) groups and local tensor products of spacetime LB1 and LB2 groups of transformations. These new tetrads define at every point in spacetime two orthogonal planes that we called blades or planes one and two. These are the local planes of covariant diagonalization of the stress-energy tensor. These tetrads are gauge dependent. Tetrad local gauge transformations leave the tetrads inside the local original planes without leaving them. These local tetrad gauge transformations enable the possibility to connect local gauge groups Abelian or non-Abelian with local groups of tetrad transformations. These new tetrads have displayed manifestly and non-trivially the coupling between Yang-Mills fields and gravity. The new tetrads and the stress-energy tensor allow for the introduction of three new local gauge invariant objects. Using these new gauge invariant objects and in addition a new general local duality transformation, a new algorithm for the gauge invariant diagonalization of the Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor is developed as an application. This is a paper about grand Standard Model gauge theories - General Relativity gravity unification and grand group unification in four-dimensional curved Lorentzian spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Chigusa, Moroi, and Shoji, we propose a new simple gradient flow equation to derive the bounce solution which contributes to the decay of the false vacuum. Our discussion utilizes the discussion of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin and we solve a minimization problem of the kinetic energy while fixing the potential energy. The bounce solution is derived as a scale-transformed of the solution of this problem. We also show that the convergence of our method is robust against a choice of the initial configuration.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff measure of sets of non-Lyapunov behaviour, and a Jarnik-type theorem for random Schroedinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the growth of the norms of transfer matrices of ergodic discrete Schr\"odinger operators in one dimension. It is known that the set of energies at which the rate of exponential growth is slower than prescribed by the Lyapunov exponent is residual in the part of the spectrum at which the Lyapunov exponent is positive. On the other hand, this exceptional set is of vanishing Hausdorff measure with respect to any gauge function $\rho(t)$ such that $\rho(t)/t$ is integrable at zero. Here we show that this condition on $\rho(t)$ can not in general be improved: for operators with independent, identically distributed potentials of sufficiently regular distribution, the set of energies at which the rate of exponential growth is arbitrarily slow has infinite Hausdorff measure with respect to any gauge function $\rho(t)$ such that $\rho(t)/t$ is non-increasing and not integrable at zero. The main technical ingredient, possibly of independent interest, is a Jarn\'ik-type theorem describing the Hausdorff measure of the set of real numbers well approximated by the eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger operator. The proof of this result relies on the theory of Anderson localisation and on the mass transference principle of Beresnevich--Velani.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the notion of a curved pre-Calabi--Yau algebra is equivalent to the notion of a curved homotopy double Poisson gebra, thereby settling the equivalence between the two ways to define derived noncommutative Poisson structures. We actually prove that the respective differential graded Lie algebras controlling both deformation theories are isomorphic.This allows us to apply the recent developments of the properadic calculus in order to establish the homotopical properties of curved pre-Calabi--Yau algebras: infinity-morphisms, homotopy transfer theorem, formality, Koszul hierarchy, and twisting procedure.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Quantum Unique Ergodicity at the Spectral Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the eigenvector mass distribution of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix on a set of coordinates $I$ satisfying $| I | \ge c N$ for some constant $c &gt;0$. For eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues at the spectral edge, we show that the sum of the mass on these coordinates converges to a Gaussian in the $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit, after a suitable rescaling and centering. The proof proceeds by a two moment matching argument. We directly compare edge eigenvector observables of an arbitrary Wigner matrix to those of a Gaussian matrix, which may be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Optimal Convergence Rate of Lie-Trotter Approximation for Quantum Thermal Averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf non-invertible symmetry-protected topological spin liquid and lattice realization of (1+1)D symmetry topological field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce weak Hopf symmetry as a tool to explore (1+1)-dimensional topological phases with non-invertible symmetries. Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Superspace and Bloch Electron Systems with Zeeman Effects: *-Bracket Formalism for Super Curtright-Zachos Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case, we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading, revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems while preserving essential algebraic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of varying system conditions on the single-particle entanglement entropy for an arbitrary eigenstate of a complex system that can be described by a multiparametric Gaussian ensemble. Our theoretical analysis leads to the identification of a single functional of the system parameters that governs the entropy dynamics. This reveals a sensitivity of the entropy to collective information content, characterized by the functional, instead of the individual system details. The functional can further be used to identify the universality classes as well as a deep web of connection underlying different quantum states.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of the largest eigenvalue for deformed GOE/GUE random matrices via replica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function $P(\lambda)$ of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of $N \times N$ random matrices of the form $H + V$, where $H$ belongs to the GOE/GUE ensemble and $V$ is a full rank deterministic diagonal perturbation. This model is related to spherical spin glasses and semi-discrete directed polymers. In the large $N$ limit, using the replica method introduced in Ref. \cite{TrivializationUs2014}, we obtain the rate function ${\cal L}(\lambda)$ which describes the upper large deviation tail $P(\lambda) \sim e^{- \beta N {\cal L}(\lambda) }$. We also obtain the moment generating function $\langle e^{N s {\lambda}_{\max} } \rangle \sim e^{N \phi(s)}$ and the overlap of the optimal eigenvector with the perturbation $V$. For suitable $V$, a transition generically occurs in the rate functions. For the GUE it has a direct interpretation as a localisation transition for tilted directed polymers with competing columnar and point disorder. Although in a different form, our results are consistent with those obtained recently by Mc Kenna in \cite{McKenna2021}. Finally, we consider briefly the quadratic optimisation problem in presence of an additional random field and obtain its large deviation rate function, although only within the replica symmetric phase.</description>

      <title>On the open TS/ST correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the property of complete monotonicity within a special family $\mathcal{F}_s$ of functions in $s$ variables involving logarithms. The main result of this work provides a linear isomorphism between $\mathcal{F}_s$ and the space of real multivariate polynomials. This isomorphism identifies the cone of completely monotone functions with the cone of non-negative polynomials. We conclude that the cone of completely monotone functions in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is semi-algebraic. This gives a finite time algorithm to decide whether a function in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is completely monotone</description>

      <title>Schramm-Loewner evolution contains a topological Sierpi\'nski carpet when $\kappa$ is close to 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE$_\kappa$) for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, which is the regime where the curve is self-intersecting but not space-filling. We show that there exists $\delta_0&gt;0$ such that for $\kappa \in (8 - \delta_0,8)$, the range of an SLE$_\kappa$ curve almost surely contains a topological Sierpi\'nski carpet. Combined with a result of Ntalampekos (2021), this implies that in this parameter range, SLE$_\kappa$ is almost surely conformally non-removable, and the conformal welding problem for SLE$_\kappa$ does not have a unique solution. Our result also implies that for $\kappa \in (8 - \delta_0,8)$, the adjacency graph of the complementary connected components of the SLE$_\kappa$ curve is disconnected.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Discontinuous Galerkin Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of the Navier--Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. The DG discretization of the adapted second-order viscous terms is carried out via the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method, obviating auxiliary variables. Based on this spatial discretization, we compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) a higher-order DG discretization for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, ii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iii) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving nonabelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multidimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to nonabelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of nonabelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of nonabelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Clean numerical simulation (CNS) of three-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering disciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by Orszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of numerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that turbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very sensitive to small disturbance. Thus, due to the famous butterfly-effect of chaos, unavoidable numerical noises of DNS might have great influence on spatiotemporal trajectories of turbulence. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov turbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than DNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS can greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required small level so that numerical noise can be rigorously negligible throughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In physics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence. Thus, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent Kolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with that given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal trajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are indeed badly polluted by numerical noise rather quickly, and besides the DNS result has significant deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the spatial symmetry of flow field and the energy cascade but also even in statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of chaos and relaxation to Gibbs equilibrium for a system of $N$ classical Brownian particles with weak mean-field interactions. It is well known that propagation of chaos holds uniformly in time with rate $O(N^{-1})$ and that Gibbs relaxation holds uniformly in $N$ with exponential rate $O(e^{-ct})$. We go one step further by establishing a cross estimate that simultaneously captures both effects: the joint deviation between chaos propagation and Gibbs relaxation is of order $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. In particular, for translation-invariant systems, this yields an accelerated propagation of chaos, with the mean-field approximation error at the level of the one-particle density improving from $O(N^{-1})$ to $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. Our approach relies on a detailed analysis of the BBGKY hierarchy for correlation functions, and applies to both underdamped and overdamped Langevin dynamics with merely bounded interaction forces. In addition, we obtain new quantitative results on Gibbs relaxation and provide partial extensions beyond the weak interaction regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the initial-boundary value problem for the Stokes system in the half-space, within the framework of weighted Lebesgue spaces. Introducing a new weight function defined via a product of powers of distances from fixed points, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity results for strong solutions to the Stokes problem in the half space. Our analysis generalizes previous results for the Stokes system in radial-weighted spaces (Galdi and Maremonti, J. Math. Fluid Mech. 25:7,2023; Maremonti and Pane, J. Math. Fluid Mech. 27:2,2025) and extends the theory to our setting. These results represent a first step toward the analysis of the Navier-Stokes system in weighted spaces, with applications in both half-space and exterior domain configurations.</description>

      <title>Extending fusion rules with finite subgroups: For a general understanding of quotient or gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.</description>

      <title>A geometric formulation of GENERIC stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a coordinate-invariant geometric formulation of the GENERIC stochastic differential equation, unifying reversible Hamiltonian and irreversible dissipative dynamics within a differential-geometric framework. Our construction builds on the classical GENERIC or metriplectic formalism, extending it to manifolds by introducing a degenerate Poisson structure, a degenerate co-metric, and a volume form satisfying a unimodularity condition. The resulting equation preserves a particular Boltzmann-type measure, ensures almost-sure conservation of energy, and reduces to the deterministic GENERIC/metriplectic formulation in the zero-noise limit. This geometrization separates system-specific quantities from the ambient space, clarifies the roles of the underlying structures, and provides a foundation for analytic and numerical methods, as well as future extensions to quantum and coarse-grained systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries and Deformations of Symmetric Product Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a bricklayer model: multi-walker realizations of true self-avoiding motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a multi-walker generalization of the true self-avoiding walk: the bricklayer model. We perform stochastic simulations, and solve the partial differential equations that describe the collective motion of $N$ bricklayers/walkers coupled to the contour of an expanding wall. In the large-$N$ limit, the results from simulation agree with the solution of the partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Emergence of Lorentzian Signature from Curvature-Minimizing Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple covariant model is presented where the signature of the metric is a dynamical field. Degenerate minima of a curvature-minimizing potential correspond to Euclidean, Lorentzian or mixed phases of geometry. The Lorentzian phase emerges as the only stable configuration supporting causal propagation.</description>
