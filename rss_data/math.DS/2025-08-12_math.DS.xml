      <title>Maximal dilatation on nonorientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On each nonorientable surface of even genus $g \geq 4$, we show that the Liechti-Strenner's polynomial in~\cite{LiechtiStrenner18} gives a maximal dilatation among pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms with an orientable invariant foliation. This is proved by showing that this polynomial is irreducible.</description>

      <title>On Irreversibility and Stochastic Systems: Part One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to characterize irreversibility of a dynamical system from the existence of different forward and backward mathematical representations depending on the direction of the time arrow. Such different representations have been studied intensively and are shown to exist for stochastic diffusion models. In this setting one has however to face the preliminary justification of stochastic description for physical systems which are described by classical mechanics as inherently deterministic and conservative.
  In part one of this paper we first address this modeling problem for linear systems in a deterministic context. We show that forward-backward representations can also describe conservative finite dimensional deterministic systems when they are coupled to an infinite-dimensional conservative heat bath. A novel key observation is that the heat bath acts on the finite-dimensional conservative system by {\em state-feedback} and can shift its eigenvalues to make the system dissipative but may also generate another totally unstable model which naturally evolves backward in time.
  In the second part, we address the stochastic description of these two representations. Under a natural family of invariant measures the heat bath can be shown to induce a white noise input acting on the system making it look like a true dissipative diffusion.</description>

      <title>Wave Propagation Dynamics via Lattice Difference Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a lattice difference equation (LDE) framework to model the spatial dynamics of invasion in populations. This framework extends beyond classical integro-difference and reaction-diffusion models by incorporating spatial discreteness and habitat fragmentation more faithfully, making it well-suited for urban and patchy landscapes. We characterize the local stability of equilibria, and demonstrate the existence of traveling wave solutions. A key focus is on how dispersal kernels--ranging from Gaussian to Cauchy--interact with the Allee effect to influence wave formation, propagation speed, and invasion success. Our numerical simulations reveal that long-tailed kernels can overcome the Allee threshold through seeding effects, significantly accelerating wave fronts. These findings have direct implications for vector control strategies, informing optimal release thresholds and spatial targeting in heterogeneous environments. Furthermore, we derive a stochastic characterization of outbreak size as a Poisson-binomial distribution, offering probabilistic insight into local infection burden and paving the way to a novel minimization criteria of release strategies based on bi-modality. Our results provide a mathematically grounded basis for predicting spatial spread and optimizing release strategies for {\it Wolbachia}-based vector control programs. This work bridges theory and application, providing both analytical insights and computational tools for understanding spatial epidemiology in discrete habitats.</description>

      <title>An abstract criterion on the existence and global stability of stationary solutions for random dynamical systems and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a concise and easily verifiable criterion on the existence and global stability of stationary solutions for random dynamical systems (RDSs). As a consequence, we can show that the $\omega$-limit sets of all pullback trajectories of semilnear/nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with additive/multiplicative white noise are composed of nontrivial random equilibria. The proof is different from the classical RDS scheme, which was established in \cite{CKS}. Furthermore, in the applications of stability analysis for SDEs, our conditions are not only sufficient but indeed sharp.</description>

      <title>Extension of generalized KYP lemma: from LTI systems to LPV systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (gKYP) lemma, established by Iwasaki and Hara (2005 IEEE TAC), has served as a fundamental tool for finite-frequency analysis and synthesis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Over the past two decades, efforts to extend the gKYP lemma from LTI systems to linear parameter varying (LPV) systems have been hindered by the intricate time-frequency inter-modulation effect between the input signal and the time-varying scheduling parameter. A key element in this framework is the frequency-dependent Integral Quadratic Constraint (IQC) function, which enables time-domain interpretation of the gKYP lemma, as demonstrated by Iwasaki et al in their companion 2005 System and Control Letter paper. The non-negativity property of this IQC function plays a crucial role in characterizing system behavior under frequency-limited inputs. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a counterexample that the IQC non-negativity property may fail for LPV systems, thereby invalidating existing results that rely on this assumption. To address this issue, we propose a reformulation strategy that replaces the original frequency range with an enlarged one, thereby restoring the non-negativity property for LPV systems. Moreover, we establish that the minimal required expansion depends on the interaction(or gap) between the system poles and the original frequency range, as well as a set of controllability Gramians. Building upon this results, an extension of gKYP lemma is presented, which allows us to conduct finite-frequency analysis of LPV systems in a direct and reliable manner. The potential and efficiency compared to existing results are demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Liv\v{s}ic regularity for random and sequential dynamics through transfer operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Liv\v{s}ic-type regularity results of coboundary representations for non-autonomous dynamical systems. Our results have an abstract nature and apply to several important specific situations, such as (higher-dimensional) random or sequential piecewise expanding maps and subshifts of finite type, which have applications to Markov interval maps and to finite state inhomogeneous elliptic Markov shifts, via symbolic representations. We also obtain results for some classes of non-autonomous hyperbolic systems. Our results can be seen as non-autonomous versions of a recent result obtained by Morris. However, we emphasize that our proof differs from the one mentioned previously even in the deterministic case.</description>

      <title>Billiards with singular invariant curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the regularity of invariant curves of rotation number $1/2$ for a special class of symplectic twist maps of the annulus, billiard maps. We construct strictly convex smooth tables close to the circle having singular (i.e. not $C^1$) invariant curves. Our method relies on a modification of the classical string construction and allows precise control over the location of singularities: they form a discrete set whose closure can contain virtually any closed subset of $\mathbb{S}^1$. Each singularity corresponds to a hyperbolic $2$-periodic trajectory and the invariant curves admit distinct one-sided derivatives at these points. An analogous construction yields perturbations of constant-width tables with invariant curves of rotation number $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Khintchine dichotomy and Schmidt estimates for self-similar measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical theorems of Khintchine and Schmidt in metric Diophantine approximation to the context of self-similar measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. For this, we establish effective equidistribution of associated random walks on $\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{Z})$.
  This generalizes our previous work which requires $d=1$ and restricts Schmidt-type counting estimates to approximation functions which decay fast enough.
  Novel techniques include a bootstrap scheme for the associated random walks despite algebraic obstructions, and a refined treatment of Dani's correspondence. We also establish non-concentration properties of self-similar measures near algebraic subvarieties of $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>On $q$-real and $q$-complex numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:1812.00170, S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko introduced the notion of the $q$-rational number $[x]_q$, $x\in \Bbb Q$, a rational function specializing to $x$ at $q=1$, obtained by $q$-deforming the continued fraction expansion of $x$. In arXiv:1908.04365 they introduced $q$-real numbers $[x]_q$, $x\in \Bbb R$ - a Laurent series in $q$ converging to the rational function $[x]_q$ when $x\in \Bbb Q$. In arXiv:2102.00891 it is proved that if $x\in \Bbb Q_{&gt;1}$ then the series $[x]_q$ converges for $|q|&lt;3-2\sqrt{2}\approx 0.17$ and conjectured that for all $x\in \Bbb R_{&gt;1}$ this series converges in some disk centered in the origin, with the expected common radius of convergence $R_*=\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx 0.38$, achieved when $x=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the golden ratio. This was proved for rational $x$ in arXiv:2405.15970 using the theory of Kleinian groups. In this paper we (partially) prove this conjecture by showing that for all $x\in \Bbb R_{&gt;1}$, the series $[x]_q$ converges in the disk $|q|&lt;3-2\sqrt{2}$ to a nonvanishing holomorphic function. This is achieved by giving an expansion of $1/[x]_q$ into a $q$-adically convergent series of rational functions converging absolutely and uniformly on compact sets in an explicit region $D$ containing this disk. We also show that this expansion converges to a positive analytic function on the interval $(-\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2},1)$, giving a definition of $[x]_q$ for $q$ from this interval. Moreover, we show that the result of arXiv:2405.15970 implies convergence of $[x]_q$ for $|q|&lt;2-\sqrt{3}\approx 0.27$. We also give examples of explicit computation of $[x]_q$ for transcendental numbers $x$, e.g. $x={\rm cotan}(1)$. Finally, we propose a definition of the $q$-complex number $[\tau]_q$, a meromorphic function of $\tau\in \Bbb C_+$ which expresses via hypergeometric functions of modular functions of $\tau$.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Benchmarking of GBEES Applied to Outer Planet Orbiter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moment-based estimation filters have successfully aided spacecraft navigation for decades. However, future missions plan to venture into deep-space regimes with significant round-trip light-time telecommunication delays, operate in unstable, quasi-periodic orbits, and perform highly precise, low-altitude flybys of outer planet moons. These complex trajectories may necessitate ensemble-based filters for accurate estimation over realistic measurement cadences. To mitigate the inherent risk associated with testing novel navigation software, ensemble filters must be accurate, efficient, and robust. Grid-based, Bayesian Estimation Exploiting Sparsity, a high-dimensional Godunov-type finite volume method that propagates the full probability distribution function, demonstrates strong overall performance across all these criteria when compared with the contemporary landscape of filters. These qualities are exhibited via a Bayesian investigation in which the state uncertainty of a Saturn-Enceladus Distant Prograde Orbit is propagated, incorporating infrequent, nonlinear measurement updates. Along with root mean square error, we use the Bhattacharyya coefficient, a non-normal metric for measuring the dissimilarity between distributions, and the Effective Sampling Size, a measure of particle degeneracy, to quantitatively ascertain that in this application, Grid-based, Bayesian Estimation Exploiting Sparsity outperforms the other ensemble filters assessed, though it comes at a nontrivial computational cost.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and Dynamical Systems of Dickson Polynomials in Finite Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical properties of Dickson polynomials over finite fields, focusing on the periodicity and structural behavior of their iterated sequences. We introduce and analyze the sequence \( [D_n(x, \alpha) \mod (x^q - x)]_n \), where \( D_n(x, \alpha) \) denotes a Dickson polynomial of the first kind, and explore its periodic nature when reduced modulo \( x^q - x \). We derive explicit formulas for the period of these sequences, particularly in the case when \( n \) is coprime to \( q^2 - 1 \). In addition, we identify a symmetric property of the polynomial coefficients that plays a crucial role in the analysis of these sequences. Using tools from combinatorics, elementary number theory, and finite fields, we present algorithms to compute the exact period and investigate the dynamical structure of these polynomials. We also highlight open problems in cases where the degree \( n \) is not coprime to \( q^2 - 1 \). Our results offer deep insights into the algebraic structure of Dickson polynomials and their role in dynamical systems over finite fields.</description>

Abstract: Consider a Berkovich space over a good Banach ring and the relative projective line over it. (It is a space whose fibers are projective lines over different complete valued fields.) For each polarized endomorphism of this line, we prove that the family of equilibrium measures associated to the restrictions of the endomorphism to the fibers is continuous. The result holds, in particular, when the Banach ring is a complete valued field, a hybrid field, a complete discrete valuation ring, or the ring of integers of a number field.</description>

      <title>Essential barrier height and a probabilistic approach in characterizing potential landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to investigate the shape of landscapes of multi-dimensional potential functions. Under a suitable coupling scheme, two copies of the overdamped Langevin dynamics associated with the potential function are coupled, and the coupling times are collected. Assuming a set of intuitive yet technically challenging conditions on the coupling scheme, it is shown that the tail distributions of the coupling times exhibit qualitatively different dependencies on the noise magnitude for single-well versus multi-well potential functions. More specifically, for convex single-well potentials, the negative tail exponent of the coupling time distribution is uniformly bounded away from zero by the convexity parameter and is independent of the noise magnitude. In contrast, for multi-well potentials, the negative tail exponent decreases exponentially as the noise vanishes, with the decay rate governed by the essential barrier height, a quantity introduced in this paper to characterize the non-convex nature of the potential function. Numerical investigations are conducted for a variety of examples, including the Rosenbrock function, interacting particle systems, and loss functions arising in artificial neural networks. These examples not only illustrate the theoretical results in various contexts but also provide crucial numerical validation of the conjectured assumptions, which are essential to the theoretical analysis yet lie beyond the reach of standard technical tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the concept of strong pluripotency of dynamical systems for a hyperbolic invariant set, as introduced in [KNS]. To the best of our knowledge, for the whole hyperbolic invariant set, the existence of robust strongly pluripotent dynamical systems has not been proven in previous studies. In fact, there is an example of strongly pluripotent dynamical systems in [CV01], but its robustness has not been proven. On the other hand, robust strongly pluripotent dynamical systems for some proper subsets of hyperbolic sets had been found in [KS17, KNS]. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial way to recognize strongly pluripotent diffeomorphisms in a Newhouse domain and prove that they are $C^r$-robust, $2\leq r&lt; \infty$. More precisely, we prove that there is a 2-dimensional diffeomorphism with a wild Smale horseshoe which has a $C^r$ neighborhood $\mathcal{U}_0$ where all elements are strongly pluripotent for the whole Smale horseshoe. Moreover, it follows from the result that any property, such as having a non-trivial physical measure supported by the Smale horseshoe or having historic behavior, is $C^r$-persistent relative to a dense subset of $\mathcal{U}_0$.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing for Gibbs measures on self-conformal sets and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that Gibbs measures on self-conformal sets generated by a $C^{1+\alpha}$ conformal IFS on $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying the OSC are exponentially mixing. We exploit this to obtain essentially sharp asymptotic counting statements for the recurrent and the shrinking target subsets associated with any such set. In particular, we provide explicit examples of dynamical systems for which the recurrent sets exhibit (unexpected) behavior that is not present in the shrinking target setup. In the process of establishing our exponential mixing result we extend Mattila's rigidity theorem for self-similar sets to self-conformal sets without any separation condition and for arbitrary Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems on torus related to general Heun equations: phase-lock areas and constriction breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity theory can be modeled by the family of dynamical systems on the torus, which is known as the RSJ model. This family admits an equivalent description by a family of second-order differential equations: special double confluent Heun equations. In the present paper, we construct two new families of dynamical systems on torus that can be equivalently described by a family of general Heun equations (GHE), with four singular points, and confluent Heun equations, with three singular points. The first family, related to GHE, is a deformation of the RSJ model, which will be denoted by dRSJ. The phase-lock areas of a family of dynamical systems on the torus are those level subsets of the rotation number function that have nonempty interiors. It is known that for the RSJ model, the rotation number quantization effect occurs: phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation number values. Moreover, each phase-lock area is a chain of domains separated by points. Those separation points that do not lie on the abscissa axis are called constrictions. In the present paper, we study phase-lock areas in the new family dRSJ. The quantization effect remains valid in this family. On the other hand, we show that in the new family dRSJ the constrictions break down.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation formula for transition paths in stochastic dynamical systems by spectral flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates bifurcation phenomena and stability of most probable transition paths (MPTPs) in stochastic dynamical systems through a combined variational and spectral flow approach. Within the Onsager-Machlup framework, MPTPs are characterized as minimizers of an energy-dependent Lagrangian functional incorporating noise intensity. Existence criteria for such minimizers are established through critical value analysis and variational techniques. The main theoretical advancement is a spectral flow formula that detects bifurcation points and quantifies stability changes under noise perturbations. Specifically, the analysis reveals: (i) noise-sensitive MPTPs where variations in noise intensity destroy the minimizer property, and (ii) noise-robust MPTPs where stability is maintained despite finite noise fluctuations. These results establish a correspondence between Lagrangian bifurcations and stochastic phase transitions, providing a mathematical foundation for predicting noise-driven transition mechanisms in stochastic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01574v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the mutual energy (or the intersection product in the sense of Arakelov theory) of two dynamical systems associated to Latt\`es morphisms over $\mathbf{\bar Q}$ is uniformly bounded below and deduce a proof of a conjecture of Bogomolov-Fu-Tschinkel: the number of common images of torsion points of two non-isomorphic elliptic curves over $\mathbf{C}$ by a standard morphism to the projective line is uniformly bounded. The proof crucially relies on the theory of Berkovich spaces over $\mathbf{Z}$ and on an original argument allowing to obtain a global estimate from a central estimate (over a trivially valued field).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new method to attempt to prove that, for a given $n$, there are finitely many equivalence classes of planar central configurations in the Newtonian $n$-body problem for generic masses.
  The human part of the proof relies on tropical geometry. The crux of our technique is in a computation that we have completed for $n\leq 5$, thus confirming the celebrated result of Albouy and Kaloshin.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic Floer homology via direct limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assume $M$ to be $\mathbb R^2$ or a closed surface of genus $g \geq 1$ and $\omega$ a symplectic form on $M$. Let $\varphi: M \to M$ be a symplectomorphism with hyperbolic fixed point $x$ and transversely intersecting stable and unstable manifolds $W^s(\varphi, x)$ and $ W^u(\varphi, x)$. The intersection points $W^s(\varphi, x) \cap\ W^u(\varphi, x)=:{\mathcal H}(\varphi, x)$ are called homoclinic points, and the (un)stable manifolds of a symplectomorphism are Lagrangian submanifolds.
  For this Lagrangian intersection problem with its wildly oscillating Lagrangian manifolds and infinite number of intersection points, we introduced in earlier works Floer homologies generated by so-called (semi)primary homoclinic points and analysed their dynamical and geometric properties.
  In this paper, we significantly generalise these earlier results by first defining a Floer homology generated by finite sets of contractible homoclinic points. These Floer homologies nevertheless still consider rather `local' aspects of $W^s(\varphi, x) \cap\ W^u(\varphi, x)$ since their generator sets are finite (but the number of contractible homoclinic points is infinite).
  To overcome this issue, we construct a direct limit of these `local' homoclinic Floer homologies over suitable index sets. These direct limits accumulate the information gathered by the finitely generated `local' homoclinic Floer homologies.</description>

      <title>Nearly geodesic surfaces are filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic $3$-manifold. A homotopy class $[S]$ of surfaces in $M$ is filling if any representative cuts $M$ into components contractible in $M$. We prove that there exist $\epsilon_0, g_0&gt;0$ such that every homotopy class of $(1+\epsilon)$-quasi-Fuchsian surfaces with $0&lt;\epsilon\leq \epsilon_0$ or totally geodesic surfaces of genus $\geq g_0$ in $M$ is filling. As a corollary, except for at most finitely many totally geodesic surfaces, embedded incompressible quasi-Fuchsian surfaces in $M$ have constants bounded below by $1+\epsilon_0$. This also gives a gap theorem for embedded minimal surfaces. Each of these surfaces separates any pair of distinct points at the sphere of infinity. Crucial tools include the rigidity results of Mozes-Shah, Ratner, and Shah. This work is inspired by a question of Wu and Xue whether random geodesics on random hyperbolic surfaces are filling.</description>

      <title>Notes on the Finiteness of Powers of Two with All Even Digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding positive integers $n$ such that all the decimal digits of $2^n$ are even, i.e., belong to $\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}$. Computational checks up to $n = 10^{15}$ reveal the known cases $n = 1, 2, 3, 6, 11$ and no additional instances. We present a self-contained argument, based on a dynamical Borel-Cantelli lemma, that establishes a metric result related to this problem. We show that the set of "initial phases" in a corresponding dynamical system that would generate infinitely many such powers is of Lebesgue measure zero, providing strong probabilistic support for the finiteness conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Let K be a number field and let f(x) = x^q + c where q is a prime power, c is in K, and f is not post-critically finite. We show that for any strictly preperiodic b in K, the iterated Galois group at b with respect to f has finite index in the generic iterated Galois group for f.</description>
