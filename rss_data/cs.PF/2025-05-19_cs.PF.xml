      <title>Effects of the Auto-Correlation of Delays on the Age of Information: A Gaussian Process Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The age of information (AoI) has been studied actively in recent years as a performance measure for systems that require real-time performance, such as remote monitoring systems via communication networks. The theoretical analysis of the AoI is usually formulated based on explicit system modeling, such as a single-server queueing model. However, in general, the behavior of large-scale systems such as communication networks is complex, and it is usually difficult to express the delay using simple queueing models. In this paper, we consider a framework in which the sequence of delays is composed from a non-negative continuous-time stochastic process, called a virtual delay process, as a new modeling approach for the theoretical analysis of the AoI. Under such a framework, we derive an expression for the transient probability distribution of the AoI and further apply the theory of stochastic orders to prove that the high dependence of the sequence of delays leads to the degradation of AoI performance. We further consider a special case in which the sequence of delays is generated from a stationary Gaussian process, and we discuss the sensitivity of the AoI to second-order statistics of the delay process through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>SageAttention3: Microscaling FP4 Attention for Inference and An Exploration of 8-Bit Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090. Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower convergence in pretraining tasks. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Automated Congestion Control Customization in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congestion control (CC) crucially impacts user experience across Internet services like streaming, gaming, AR/VR, and connected cars. Traditionally, CC algorithm design seeks universal control rules that yield high performance across diverse application domains and networks. However, varying service needs and network conditions challenge this approach. We share operational experience with a system that automatically customizes congestion control logic to service needs and network conditions. We discuss design, deployment challenges, and solutions, highlighting performance benefits through case studies in streaming, gaming, connected cars, and more.
  Our system leverages PCC Vivace, an online-learning based congestion control protocol developed by researchers. Hence, along with insights from customizing congestion control, we also discuss lessons learned and modifications made to adapt PCC Vivace for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>eBPF-Based Instrumentation for Generalisable Diagnosis of Performance Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Data Intensive applications (e.g. message brokers, ML inference and databases) are core components of the modern internet, providing critical functionalities to connecting services. The load variability and interference they experience are generally the main causes of Quality of Service (QoS) degradation, harming depending applications, and resulting in an impaired end-user experience. Uncovering the cause of QoS degradation requires detailed instrumentation of an application's activity. Existing generalisable approaches utilise readily available system metrics that encode interference in kernel metrics, but unfortunately, these approaches lack the required detail to pinpoint granular causes of performance degradation (e.g., lock, disk and CPU contention). In contrast, this paper explores the use of fine-grained system-level metrics to facilitate an application-agnostic diagnosis of QoS degradation. To this end, we introduce and implement $16$ $\textit{eBPF-based metrics}$ spanning over six kernel subsystems, which capture statistics over kernel events that often highlight obstacles impeding an application's progress. We demonstrate the use of our $\textit{eBPF-based metrics}$ through extensive experiments containing a representative set of online data-intensive applications. Results show that the implemented metrics can deconstruct performance degradation when applications face variable workload patterns and common resource contention scenarios, while also revealing applications' internal architecture constraints.</description>

      <title>Net-Zero: A Comparative Study on Neural Network Design for Climate-Economic PDEs Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate-economic modeling under uncertainty presents significant computational challenges that may limit policymakers' ability to address climate change effectively. This paper explores neural network-based approaches for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems arising from models that incorporate ambiguity aversion in climate mitigation decisions. We develop a continuous-time endogenous-growth economic model that accounts for multiple mitigation pathways, including emission-free capital and carbon intensity reductions. Given the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of these models, traditional numerical methods become computationally intractable. We benchmark several neural network architectures against finite-difference generated solutions, evaluating their ability to capture the dynamic interactions between uncertainty, technology transitions, and optimal climate policy. Our findings demonstrate that appropriate neural architecture selection significantly impacts both solution accuracy and computational efficiency when modeling climate-economic systems under uncertainty. These methodological advances enable more sophisticated modeling of climate policy decisions, allowing for better representation of technology transitions and uncertainty-critical elements for developing effective mitigation strategies in the face of climate change.</description>
