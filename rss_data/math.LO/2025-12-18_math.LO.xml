      <title>Uniform Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform interpolation is a strengthening of interpolation that holds for certain propositional logics. The starting point of this chapter is a theorem of A. Pitts, which shows that uniform interpolation holds for intuitionistic propositional logic. We outline how this theorem may be proved semantically via the definability of bisimulation quantifiers, and how it generalizes to an open mapping theorem between Esakia spaces. We also discuss connections between uniform interpolation and research in categorical logic, algebra, and model theory.</description>

      <title>Universally meager sets in the Miller model and similar ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work in the realm of sets of reals. We prove that in the Miller model and in a model constructed by Goldstern-Judah-Shelah all universally meager sets have size at most $\omega_1$. Some relations between combinatorial covering properties in these models allow to obtain the same limitations for sizes of Rothberger spaces and Hurewicz spaces with no homeomorphic copy of the Cantor set inside. It follows from our results that the existence of a strong measure zero set of size $\omega_2$ does not imply the existence of a Rothberger space of size $\omega_2$. We also prove that in the Miller model all strong measure zero sets have size at most $\omega_1$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic and relative characterization results for logics with negative modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce simulations for modal logics with subclassical negations and restoration modalities, establish an adequacy theorem, and prove intrinsic (Hennessy-Milner-type) and relative (Van Benthem-type) characterization results. These results identify each restorative language with the fragment of first-order logic invariant under its simulations and delineate the expressive profile of modal logics with non-classical negations.</description>

      <title>Expressibility and inexpressibility in propositional team logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop dimension theoretic methods for propositional team based logics. Such quantitative methods were defined for team based first-order logic in a recent paper by Hella, Luosto and the third author and were used to obtain strong hierarchy results in the first-order logic context. We show that in propositional logic and in several important cases, a team theoretical atom can be expressed in terms of atoms of lower arity. We estimate the `price' of such a reduction of arity, i.e. how much more complicated the new expression is. Our estimates involve as parameters the arity of the atoms involved, as well as the number of times the atom occurs in a formula. We also consider new variants of atoms and propositional operations, inspired by our work. We believe that our quantitative analysis leads to a deeper understanding of the scope and limits of propositional team based logic.</description>

      <title>A study of cut-elimination for a non-labelled cyclic proof system for propositional dynamic logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic logic is a logic for reasoning about programs. A cyclic proof system is a proof system that allows proofs containing cycles and is an alternative to a proof system containing (co-)induction. This paper introduces a sequent calculus and a non-labelled cyclic proof system for an extension of propositional dynamic logic obtained by adding backwards modal operators. We prove the soundness and completeness of these systems and show that cut-elimination fails in both. Moreover, we show the cut-elimination property of the cyclic proof system for propositional dynamic logic obtained by restricting ours.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Sequential Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of sequences is said to converge simultaneously if there exists an infinite subset $H$ of the index set $\omega$ such that all sequences converge when restricted to $H$. We discuss simultaneous convergence of sequences in the same or in different sequentially compact spaces; we link the results for different spaces to ones for the same space; we show that simultaneous convergence happens for less than $\mathfrak s$ sequences in spaces with weight bounded by $\mathfrak s$ and for less than $\mathfrak h$ sequences in general; we show a slight generalisation of these results in the context of Hausdorff spaces; and finally we investigate their optimality.</description>

      <title>A model for global compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a classical paper by Ben-David and Magidor, a model of set theory was exhibited in which $\aleph_{\omega+1}$ carries a uniform ultrafilter that is $\theta$-indecomposable for every uncountable cardinal $\theta&lt;\aleph_\omega$. In this paper, we give a global version of this result, as follows:
  Assuming the consistency of a supercompact cardinal, we produce a model of set theory in which for every singular cardinal $\lambda$, there exists a uniform ultrafilter on $\lambda^+$ that is $\theta$-indecomposable for every cardinal $\theta$ such that $cf(\lambda)&lt;\theta&lt;\lambda$. In our model, many instances of compactness for chromatic numbers hold, from which we infer that Hajnal's gap-1 counterexample to Hedetniemi's conjecture is best possible on the grounds of ZFC.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of valued fields: amalgamation and existential closedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study valued fields equipped with an automorphism. We prove that all of them have an extension admitting an equivariant cross-section of the valuation. In residual characteristic zero, and in the presence of such a cross-section, we show that amalgamation problems are solvable precisely when the induced residual problem is, characterise the existentially closed objects of this category, and prove that its positive theory does not have the tree property of the second kind. We prove analogous results with cross-sections replaced by angular components. Along the way, we show that array modelling does not require thickness.</description>

      <title>Homotopy type theory as a language for diagrams of $\infty$-logoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02444v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that certain diagrams of $\infty$-logoses are reconstructed in homotopy type theory extended with some lex, accessible modalities, which enables us to use plain homotopy type theory to reason about not only a single $\infty$-logos but also a diagram of $\infty$-logoses. This also provides a higher dimensional version of Sterling's synthetic Tait computability -- a type theory for higher dimensional logical relations.</description>

      <title>Embedding Borel graphs into grids of asymptotically optimal dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Borel graph all of whose finite subgraphs embed into the $d$-dimensional grid with diagonals. We show that then $G$ itself admits a Borel embedding into the Schreier graph of a free Borel action of $\mathbb Z^{O(d)}$. This strengthens an earlier result of the authors, in which $O(d)$ is replaced by $O(\rho \log \rho)$, where $\rho$ is the polynomial growth rate of $G$.</description>

      <title>Computable thermodynamic formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the theory of thermodynamic formalism from the perspective of computable analysis, with a special focus on the computability of equilibrium states. Specifically, we develop two complementary general approaches to verify the computability of equilibrium states for nonuniformly expanding computable dynamical systems. The first approach applies to dynamical systems whose topological pressure functions admit effective approximations and whose measure-theoretic entropy functions are upper semicontinuous. As a concrete application, we establish the computability of the equilibrium states for Misiurewicz-Thurston rational maps with H\"older continuous potentials. The second approach exploits prescribed Jacobians of equilibrium states through a local analysis and applies to settings where the measure-theoretic entropy functions may lack upper semicontinuity.</description>
