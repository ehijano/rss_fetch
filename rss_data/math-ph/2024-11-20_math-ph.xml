      <title>Exact physical quantities of the XYZ spin chain in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic limits of the XYZ spin chain with periodic or twisted boundary conditions are studied. By using the technique of characterizing the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix by the $T-Q$ relation and by the zeros of the associated polynomial, we obtain the constraints of the Bethe roots and the zeros for the eigenvalues. With the help of structure of Bethe roots, we obtain the distribution patterns of zeros. Based on them, the physical quantities such as the surface energy and excitation energy are calculated. We find that both of them depend on the parity of sites number due to the topological long-range Neel order on the Mobius manifold in the spin space. We also check our results with those obtaining by the density matrix renormalization group. The method provided in this paper can be applied to study the thermodynamic properties at the thermal equilibrium state with finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Qualitative analysis for finitely degenerate semilinear pseudo-parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the initial boundary value problem of finitely degenerate semilinear pseudo-parabolic equations associated with H\"{o}rmander's operator. For the low and critical initial energies, based on the global existence of solutions in the previous literature, we investigate the exponential decay estimate of the energy functional. Moreover, we provide a method different from the previous literature to prove the finite time blow-up of solutions under low and critical initial energies, and derive the upper bounds of blow-up time and the rate as well as the exponential growth estimate of blow-up solutions. Furthermore, we prove the existence of global solutions and blow-up solutions at high initial energy. In particular, we establish a blow-up condition independent of the mountain pass level and provide the upper bound of blow-up time and the exponential growth estimate of blow-up solutions, and further we prove the existence of blow-up solutions with arbitrary initial energy by utilizing this blow-up condition. Finally, we determine a lower bound of the blow-up rate for all the above-mentioned blow-up solutions. These results complement the ones obtained in the previous literature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic tunneling between disc-shaped obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive formulae for the semiclassical tunneling in the presence of a constant magnetic field in 2 dimensions. The `wells' in the problem are identical discs with Neumann boundary conditions, so we study the magnetic Neumann Laplacian in the complement of a set of discs. We provide a reduction method to an interaction matrix, which works for a general configuration of obstacles. When there are two discs, we deduce an asymptotic formula for the spectral gap. When the discs are placed along a regular lattice, we derive an effective operator which gives rise to the famous Harper's equation. Main challenges in this problem compared to recent results on magnetic tunneling are the fact that one-well ground states have non-trivial angular momentum which depends on the semiclassical parameter, and the existence of eigenvalue crossings.</description>

      <title>Trace formula for quantum chaotic systems with geometrical symmetries and spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a Gutzwiller-type trace formula for quantum chaotic systems that accounts for both particle spin precession and discrete geometrical symmetries. This formula generalises previous results that were obtained either for systems with spin [1,2] or for systems with symmetries [3,4], but not for a combination of both. The derivation requires not only a combination of methodologies for these two settings, but also the treatment of new effects in the form of double groups and spin components of symmetry operations. The resulting trace formula expresses the level density of subspectra associated to irreducible representations of the group of unitary symmetries in terms of periodic orbits in the system's fundamental domain. We also derive a corresponding expression for the spectral determinant. In a follow-up paper [5] we will show that our formula allows to study the impact of geometrical symmetries and spin on spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>The Nahm transform of multi-fractional instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We embed the multi-fractional instantons of $SU(N)$ gauge theories on $\mathbb T^4$ with 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions into $U(N)$ bundles and use the Nahm transform to study the corresponding configurations on the dual $\widehat{\mathbb T}^4$. We first show that $SU(N)$ fractional instantons of topological charge $Q={r \over N}$, $r \in \{1, 2,...,N-1\}$, are mapped to fractional instantons of $SU(\widehat N)$ of charge $\widehat Q = {r \over \widehat N}$, where $\widehat N = N q_1 q_3 - r q_3 + q_1$ and $q_{1,3}$ are integer-quantized $U(1)$ fluxes. We then explicitly construct the Nahm transform of constant field strength fractional instantons of $SU(N)$ and find the $SU(\widehat N)$ configurations they map to. Both the $\mathbb T^4$ instantons and their $\widehat {\mathbb T}^4$ images are self-dual for appropriately tuned torus periods. The Nahm duality can be extended to tori with detuned periods, with detuning parameter $\Delta$, mapping solutions with $\Delta &gt;0$ on $\mathbb T^4$ to ones with $\widehat\Delta &lt;0$ on $\widehat{\mathbb T}^4$. We also recall that fractional instantons appear in string theory precisely via the $U(N)$ embedding, suggesting that studying the end point of tachyon condensation for $\Delta \ne 0$ is needed -- and is perhaps feasible in a small-$\Delta$ expansion, as in field theory studies -- in order to understand the appearance and role of fractional instantons in $D$-brane constructions.</description>

      <title>The Hidden M-Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following arguments that the (hidden) M-algebra serves as the maximal super-exceptional tangent space for 11D supergravity, we make explicit here its integration to a (super-Lie) group. This is equipped with a left-invariant extension of the ''decomposed'' M-theory 3-form, such that it constitutes the Kleinian space on which super-exceptional spacetimes are to be locally modeled as Cartan geometries.
  As a simple but consequential application, we highlight how to describe lattice subgroups $\mathbb{Z}^{k \leq 528}$ of the hidden M-group that allow to toroidially compactify also the ''hidden'' dimensions of a super-exceptional spacetime, akin to the familiar situation in topological T-duality.
  In order to deal with subtleties in these constructions, we (i) provide a computer-checked re-derivation of the ''decompose'' M-theory 3-form, and (ii) present a streamlined conception of super-Lie groups, that is both rigorous while still close to physics intuition and practice.
  Thereby this article highlights modernized super-Lie theory along the example of the hidden M-algebra, with an eye towards laying foundations for super-exceptional geometry. Among new observations is the dimensional reduction of the hidden M-algebra to a ''hidden IIA-algebra'' which in a companion article we explain as the exceptional extension of the T-duality doubled super-spacetime.</description>

      <title>Mechanical presymplectic structures and Marsden-Weinstein reduction of time-dependent Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1986, Albert proposed a Marsden-Weinstein reduction process for cosymplectic structures. In this paper, we present the limitations of this theory in the application of the reduction of symmetric time-dependent Hamiltonian systems. As a consequence, we conclude that cosymplectic geometry is not appropriate for this reduction. Motived for this fact, we replace cosymplectic structures by more general structures: mechanical presymplectic structures. Then, we develop Marsden-Weinstein reduction for this kind of structures and we apply this theory to interesting examples of time-dependent Hamiltonian systems for which Albert's reduction method doesn't work.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis for different finite element types in strain-gradient elasticity simulations performed on Firedrake and FEniCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layer-upon-layer approach in additive manufacturing, open or closed cells in polymeric or metallic foams involve an intrinsic microstructure tailored to the underlying applications. Homogenization of such architectured materials creates metamaterials modeled by higher-gradient models, specifically when the microstructure's characteristic length is comparable to the length scale of the structure. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of various finite elements methods for solving problems in strain-gradient elasticity. We employ open-source packages from Firedrake and FEniCS. Different finite element formulations are tested: we implement Lagrange, Argyris, Hermite elements, a Hu--Washizu type (mixed) formulation, as well as isogeometric analysis with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). For the numerical study, we investigate one- and two-dimensional problems discussed in the literature of strain-gradient modeling. All developed codes are open-access to encourage research in Finite Element Method (FEM) based computation of generalized continua.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Boltzmann equation with the constant collision kernel in the case of spatially periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^d$, $d\geq 2$. Using the existing techniques from nonlinear dispersive PDEs, we prove the local well-posedness result in $L^{2,r}_vH^s_x$ for $s&gt;\frac{d}{2}-\frac{1}{4}$ and $r&gt;\frac{d}{2}$. To reach the result, the main tool we establish is the $L^4$ Strichartz estimate for solutions to the corresponding linear equation.</description>

      <title>Edge universality of $\beta$-additions through Dunkl operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the edge limit of Gaussian/Laguerre Beta ensembles is given by Airy($\beta$) point process. We prove an universality result that this also holds for a general class of additions of Gaussian and Laguerre ensembles. In order to make sense of $\beta$-addition, we introduce type A Bessel function as the characteristic function of our matrix ensemble following the line of Gorin-Marcus, Benaych Georges-Cuenca-Gorin. Then we extract its moment information through the action of Dunkl operators, a class of differential operators originated from special function theory. We do the action explicitly on the Bessel generating functions of our additions, and after the asymptotic analysis, we obtain certain limiting functional in terms of conditional Brownian bridges of the Laplace transform of Airy($\beta$), which is universal up to proper rescaling among all our additions.</description>

      <title>Nonassociative gauge gravity theories with R-flux star products and Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization in algebraic quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonassociative modifications of general relativity, GR, and quantum gravity, QG, models naturally arise as star product and R-flux deformations considered in string/ M-theory. Such nonassociative and noncommutative geometric and quantum information theories were formulated on phase spaces defined as cotangent Lorentz bundles enabled with nonassociative symmetric and nonsymmetric metrics and nonlinear and linear connection structures. We outline the analytic methods and proofs that corresponding geometric flow evolution and dynamical field equations can be decoupled and integrated in certain general off-diagonal forms. New classes of solutions describing nonassociative black holes, wormholes, and locally anisotropic cosmological configurations are constructed using such methods. We develop the Batalin-Vilkovisky, BV, formalism for quantizing modified gravity theories, MGTs, involving twisted star products and semi-classical models of nonassociative gauge gravity with de Sitter/affine/ Poincar\'{e} double structure groups. Such theories can be projected on Lorentz spacetime manifolds in certain forms equivalent to GR or MGTs with torsion generalizations etc. We study the properties of the classical and quantum BV operators for nonassociative phase spaces and nonassociative gauge gravity. Recent results and methods from algebraic QFT are generalized to involve nonassociative star product deformations of the anomalous master Ward identity. Such constructions are elaborated in a nonassociative BV perspective and for developing non-perturbative methods in QG.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Points and Stability in Nonlinear Models of Population Dynamics having $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, for example due to environmental gain-loss processes, are a common occurrence throughout numerous areas of science and lie at the root of many remarkable phenomena. For the latter, parity-time-reflection ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry has played an eminent role in understanding exceptional-point structures and phase transitions in these systems. Yet their interplay has remained by-and-large unexplored. We analyze models governed by the replicator equation of evolutionary game theory and related Lotka-Volterra systems of population dynamics. These are foundational nonlinear models that find widespread application and offer a broad platform for non-Hermitian theory beyond physics. In this context we study the emergence of exceptional points in two cases: (a) when the governing symmetry properties are tied to global properties of the models, and, in contrast, (b) when these symmetries emerge locally around stationary states--in which case the connection between the linear non-Hermitian model and an underlying nonlinear system becomes tenuous. We outline further that when the relevant symmetries are related to global properties, the location of exceptional points in the linearization around coexistence equilibria coincides with abrupt global changes in the stability of the nonlinear dynamics. Exceptional points may thus offer a new local characteristic for the understanding of these systems. Tri-trophic models of population ecology serve as test cases for higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework for maze solving using quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical framework for identifying the shortest path in a maze using a Grover walk, which becomes non-unitary by introducing absorbing holes. In this study, we define the maze as a network with vertices connected by unweighted edges. Our analysis of the stationary state of the Grover walk on finite graphs, where we strategically place absorbing holes and self-loops on specific vertices, demonstrates that this approach can effectively solve mazes. By setting arbitrary start and goal vertices in the underlying graph, we obtain the following long-time results: (i) in tree structures, the probability amplitude is concentrated exclusively along the shortest path between start and goal; (ii) in ladder-like structures with additional paths, the probability amplitude is maximized near the shortest path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional Burgers equation linearized at a stationary shock, and investigate its null-controllability cost with a control at the left endpoint. We give an upper and a lower bound on the control time required for this cost to remain bounded in the vanishing viscosity limit, as well as a rough description of an admissible control. The proof relies on complex analysis and adapts methods previously used to tackle the same issue with a constant transport term.</description>

Abstract: In spite of its unbroken ${\cal PT}-$symmetry, the popular imaginary cubic oscillator Hamiltonian $H^{(IC)}=p^2+{\rm i}x^3$ does not satisfy all of the necessary postulates of quantum mechanics. The failure is due to the ``intrinsic exceptional point'' (IEP) features of $H^{(IC)}$ and, in particular, to the phenomenon of a high-energy asymptotic parallelization of its bound-state-mimicking eigenvectors. In the paper it is argued that the operator $H^{(IC)}$ (and the like) can only be interpreted as a manifestly unphysical, singular IEP limit of a hypothetical one-parametric family of certain standard quantum Hamiltonians. For explanation, an ample use is made of perturbation theory and of multiple analogies between IEPs and conventional Kato's exceptional points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic and Poisson geometry emerged as a tool to understand the mathematical structure behind classical mechanics. However, due to its huge development over the past century, it has become an independent field of research in differential geometry. In this lecture notes, we will introduce the essential objects and techniques in symplectic geometry (e.g Darboux coordinates, Lagrangian submanifolds, cotangent bundles) and Poisson geometry (e.g symplectic foliations, some examples of Poisson structures). This geometric approach will be motivated by examples from classical physics, and at the end we will explore applications of symplectic and Poisson geometry to Lie theory and other fields of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity, Hydrodynamics and Emergent Cosmology: A Collection of Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This collection of perspective pieces captures recent advancements and reflections from a dynamic research community dedicated to bridging quantum gravity, hydrodynamics, and emergent cosmology. It explores four key research areas: (a) the interplay between hydrodynamics and cosmology, including analog gravity systems; (b) phase transitions, continuum limits and emergent geometry in quantum gravity; (c) relational perspectives in gravity and quantum gravity; and (d) the emergence of cosmological models rooted in quantum gravity frameworks. Each contribution presents the distinct perspectives of its respective authors. Additionally, the introduction by the editors proposes an integrative view, suggesting how these thematic units could serve as foundational pillars for a novel theoretical cosmology framework termed "hydrodynamics on superspace".</description>

Abstract: We study the fluctuations in equilibrium for a dynamics of rods with random length. This includes the classical hard rod elastic collisions, when rod lengths are constant and equal to a positive value. We prove that in the diffusive space-time scaling, an initial fluctuation of density of particles of velocity $v$, after recentering on its Euler evolution, evolve randomly shifted by a Brownian motion of variance $\mathcal D(v)$.</description>

      <title>Semimartingale driven mechanics and reduction by symmetry for stochastic and dissipative dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent interest in structure preserving stochastic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems raises questions regarding how such models are to be understood and the principles through which they are to be derived. By considering a mathematically sound extension of the Hamilton-Pontryagin principle, we derive a stochastic analogue of the Euler-Lagrange equations, driven by independent semimartingales. Using this as a starting point, we can apply symmetry reduction carefully to derive non-canonical stochastic Lagrangian / Hamiltonian systems, including the stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e / Lie-Poisson equations, studied extensively in the literature. Furthermore, we develop a framework to include dissipation that balances the structure-preserving noise in such a way that the overall stochastic dynamics preserves the Gibbs measure on the symplectic manifold, where the dynamics effectively take place. In particular, this leads to a new derivation of double-bracket dissipation by considering Lie group invariant stochastic dissipative dynamics, taking place on the cotangent bundle of the group.</description>

Abstract: A novel theorem in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven and applied to the topological classification of frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This theorem generalises a result which had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{AIII/BDI}$, and $\mathrm{AIII/CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of frustrated spin models and is compared to the one of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).</description>

      <title>On one-parameter families of hermiticity-preserving superoperators which are not positive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A one-parameter family of hermiticity-preserving superoperators is a time-dependent family $\{\Phi_{t}\colon\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C})\rightarrow\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C})\}_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ of hermiticity-preserving superoperators determined, in a certain sense, by real and complex polynomial functions in the variable $t\in\mathbb{R}$. The paper studies sufficient computable criteria for nonpositivity of superoperators in one-parameter families. More precisely, we give sufficient conditions for the following assertions to hold: $(1)$ every $\Phi_{t}$ is not positive, $(2)$ $\Phi_{t}$ is not positive for $t$ in some open interval $(u,v)\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ and $(3)$ there is some $\Phi_{t}$ which is not positive. We show that in some situations $(3)$ implies $(2)$. Our approach to the problem is based on the Descartes rule of signs and the Sturm-Tarski theorem. In order to apply these facts, we introduce the sign variation formulas. These formulas are first order logical formulas in one free variable $t$, generalising sign sequences of polynomials used in Descartes rule of signs.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Uniform Continuity Bounds on Entropies in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a variety of new and refined uniform continuity bounds for entropies of both classical random variables on an infinite state space and of quantum states of infinite-dimensional systems. We obtain the first tight continuity estimate on the Shannon entropy of random variables with a countably infinite alphabet. The proof relies on a new mean-constrained Fano-type inequality and the notion of maximal coupling of random variables. We then employ this classical result to derive the first tight energy-constrained continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy of states of infinite-dimensional quantum systems, when the Hamiltonian is the number operator, which is arguably the most relevant Hamiltonian in the study of infinite-dimensional quantum systems in the context of quantum information theory.
  The above scheme works only for Shannon- and von Neumann entropies. Hence, to deal with more general entropies, e.g. $\alpha$-R\'enyi and $\alpha$-Tsallis entropies, with $\alpha \in (0,1)$, for which continuity bounds are known only for finite-dimensional systems, we develop a novel approximation scheme which relies on recent results on operator H\"older continuous functions and the equivalence of all Schatten norms in special spectral subspaces of the Hamiltonian. This approach is, as we show, motivated by continuity bounds for $\alpha$-R\'enyi and $\alpha$-Tsallis entropies of random variables that follow from the H\"older continuity of the entropy functionals. Bounds for $\alpha&gt;1$ are provided, too. Finally, we settle an open problem on related approximation questions posed in the recent works by Shirokov on the so-called Finite-dimensional Approximation (FA) property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harmonic balls are domains which satisfy the mean-value property for harmonic functions. We establish the existence and uniqueness of harmonic balls on Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces using the obstacle problem formulation of Hele-Shaw flow. We show that LQG harmonic balls are neither Lipschitz domains nor LQG metric balls, and that the boundaries of their complementary connected components are Jordan curves.
  We conjecture that LQG harmonic balls are the scaling limit of internal diffusion limited aggregation (IDLA) on random planar maps. In a companion paper, we prove this in the special case of mated-CRT maps.</description>

Abstract: We present a framework for generating convex approximations of complex contact models, incorporating experimentally validated models like Hunt &amp; Crossley coupled with Coulomb's law of friction alongside the principle of maximum dissipation. Our approach is robust across a wide range of stiffness values, making it suitable for both compliant surfaces and rigid approximations. We evaluate these approximations across a wide variety of test cases, detailing properties and limitations. We implement a fully differentiable solution in the open-source robotics toolkit, Drake. Our novel hybrid approach enables computation of gradients for complex geometric models while reusing factorizations from contact resolution. We demonstrate robust simulation of robotic tasks at interactive rates, with accurately resolved stiction and contact transitions, supporting effective sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We produce examples of solutions to the non-abelian gravitating vortex equations, which are a dimensional reduction of the K\"aher-Yang-Mills- Higgs equations. These are equations for a K\"ahler metric and a metric on a vector bundle. We consider a symmetric situation on a sphere with a relationship between the parameters involved (criticality), and perform a non-trivial reduction of the problem to a system of ordinary differential equations on the real line with complicated boundary conditions at infinity. This system involves a parameter whose dependence on the volume of the K\"ahler metric is non-explicit. We prove existence to this system using the method of continuity. We then prove that the parameter can be varied to make sure that all possible admissible volumes are attained.</description>

Abstract: We present a formalism to describe the motion of a fluid that is fully covariant with respect to arbitrary observers. To achieve full covariance, we write prognostic equations for quantities that belong to the graded exterior algebra of the cotangent bundle of the manifold occupied by the fluid. In particular, equations are that are fully covariant can be written for a purely Lagrangian observer, for which the fluid velocity (qua section of the tangent bundle) is not a meaningful concept. With the new formalism, we consider problems of stability, and we derive a generalization of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation that describes the evolution of perturbations relative to an arbitrary observer. The latter is applied to cases where the observer is the Lagrangian observer comoving with the background flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently isotropic basis functions of $N$ unit vector arguments were presented; these are of significant use in measuring the N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs) of galaxy clustering. Here we develop the generating function for these basis functions -- $i.e.$ that function which, expanded in a power series, has as its angular part the isotropic functions. We show that this can be developed using basic properties of the plane wave. A main use of the generating function is as an efficient route to obtaining the Cartesian basis expressions for the isotropic functions. We show that the methods here enable computing difficult overlap integrals of multiple spherical Bessel functions, and we also give related expansions of the Dirac Delta function into the isotropic basis. Finally, we outline how the Cartesian expressions for the isotropic basis functions might be used to enable a faster NPCF algorithm on the CPU.</description>

Abstract: To explore how rigid rotation affects the thermodynamic properties of free relativistic bosons, we employ the standard imaginary time formalism of thermal field theory to calculate the free propagator of complex scalar fields under rotation. We introduce the corresponding partition function and explicitly compute it by expanding the modes in cylindrical coordinates. The resulting propagator is in full agreement with similar findings in the existing literature.</description>

Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between a disjoint subsystem and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

Abstract: We develop a hybrid classical-quantum method for solving the Lorenz system. We use the forward Euler method to discretize the system in time, transforming it into a system of equations. This set of equations is solved using the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm. We present numerical results comparing the hybrid method with the classical approach for solving the Lorenz system. The simulation results demonstrate that the VQLS method can effectively compute solutions comparable to classical methods. The method is easily extended to solving similar nonlinear differential equations.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Riemann Shock in a Physical Class: From Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier to Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03613</link>

Abstract: The stability of an irreversible singularity, such as a Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system, in the absence of any technical conditions for perturbations, remains a major open problem even within a mono-dimensional framework. A natural approach to justify the stability of such a singularity involves considering a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits (or viscosity limits) of physical viscous flows with evanescent viscosities. We prove the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits, on which a Riemann shock of small jump strength is stable (up to a time-dependent shift) and unique. As a physical viscous model that generates vanishing dissipation limits, we adopt the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, proposed by Brenner based on the bi-velocity theory. For this viscous system, we show the uniform stability of shock with respect to the strength of the viscosity. The uniformity is ensured by the contraction estimates of any large perturbations around the shock. Since we cannot impose any smallness on initial perturbations for the contraction estimates, the density could be arbitrarily small or large. Controlling such large perturbations is the most challenging part in our analysis. The contraction estimates ensure the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits of solutions to the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. In addition, the distance of those limits from the Riemann shock, up to shifts, is controlled by the magnitude of the initial perturbations. The distance is measured by the relative entropy with a weight depending on the shock. This is the first result for the stability of Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system in a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits.</description>
