      <title>Source Invariance and Probabilistic Transfer: A Testable Theory of Probabilistic Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As animals interact with their environments, they must infer properties of their surroundings. Some animals, including humans, can represent uncertainty about those properties. But when, if ever, do they use probability distributions to represent their uncertainty? It depends on which definition we choose. In this paper, we argue that existing definitions are inadequate because they are untestable. We then propose our own definition.
  There are two reasons why existing definitions are untestable. First, they do not distinguish between representations of uncertainty and representations of variables merely related to uncertainty ('representational indeterminacy'). Second, they do not distinguish between probabilistic representations of uncertainty and merely "heuristic" representations of uncertainty. We call this 'model indeterminacy' because the underlying problem is that we do not have access to the animal's generative model.
  We define probabilistic representations by two properties: 1) they encode uncertainty regardless of the source of the uncertainty ('source invariance'), 2) they support the efficient learning of new tasks that would be more difficult to learn given non-probabilistic representations ('probabilistic task transfer'). Source invariance indicates that they are representations of uncertainty rather than variables merely related to uncertainty, thereby solving representational indeterminacy. Probabilistic task transfer indicates that they are probabilistic representations of uncertainty rather than merely heuristic representations, thereby solving model indeterminacy.</description>

      <title>Form Follows Function: A Different Approach to Neuron Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A different method of discovering how neurons are connected to process information is presented here: Design a simple logic circuit that can perform a single, biologically advantageous function. Engineering concepts can be helpful in choosing the function and in designing the logic circuit. Several implementations of the method are reviewed to demonstrate how a biologically advantageous function can be chosen, how one simple network can generate major phenomena that are widely considered unrelated, and how one network design can lead to others that explain entirely different aspects of the brain. These results show that the method can benefit neuromorphic engineering as well as neuroscience, and that some brain functions can be carried out remarkably simply, at least in principle if not in the details.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Graph Pooling for Explainable Classification of Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a commonly used technique to measure neural activation. Its application has been particularly important in identifying underlying neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Autism. Recent analysis of fMRI data models the brain as a graph and extracts features by graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the unique characteristics of fMRI data require a special design of GNN. Tailoring GNN to generate effective and domain-explainable features remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a contrastive dual-attention block and a differentiable graph pooling method called ContrastPool to better utilize GNN for brain networks, meeting fMRI-specific requirements. We apply our method to 5 resting-state fMRI brain network datasets of 3 diseases and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines. Our case study confirms that the patterns extracted by our method match the domain knowledge in neuroscience literature, and disclose direct and interesting insights. Our contributions underscore the potential of ContrastPool for advancing the understanding of brain networks and neurodegenerative conditions.

      <title>Quantifying Harmony between Direct and Indirect Pathways in The Basal Ganglia; Healthy and Parkinsonian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basal ganglia (BG) show a variety of functions for motor and cognition. There are two competitive pathways in the BG; direct pathway (DP) which facilitates movement and indirect pathway (IP) which suppresses movement. It is well known that diverse functions of the BG may be made through "balance" between DP and IP. But, to the best of our knowledge, so far no quantitative analysis for such balance was done. In this paper, as a first time, we introduce the competition degree ${\cal C}_d$ between DP and IP. Then, by employing ${\cal C}_d$, we quantify their competitive harmony (i.e., competition and cooperative interplay), which could lead to improving our understanding of the traditional "balance" so clearly and quantitatively. We first consider the case of normal dopamine (DA) level of $\phi^*=0.3$. In the case of phasic cortical input (10 Hz), a healthy state with ${\cal C}_d^* = 2.82$ (i.e., DP is 2.82 times stronger than IP) appears. In this case, normal movement occurs via harmony between DP and IP. Next, we consider the case of decreased DA level, $\phi = \phi^*(=0.3)~x_{DA}$ ($1 &gt; x_{DA} \geq 0$). With decreasing $x_{DA}$ from 1, the competition degree ${\cal C}_d$ between DP and IP decreases monotonically from ${\cal C}_d^*$, which results in appearance of a pathological Parkinsonian state with reduced ${\cal C}_d$. In this Parkinsonian state, strength of IP is much increased than that in the case of normal healthy state, leading to disharmony between DP and IP. Due to such break-up of harmony between DP and IP, impaired movement occurs. Finally, we also study treatment of the pathological Parkinsonian state via recovery of harmony between DP and IP.</description>

      <title>Efficient Representation of Natural Image Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing an abstract information processing model based on minimal yet realistic assumptions inspired by biological systems, we study how to achieve the early visual system's two ultimate objectives: efficient information transmission and accurate sensor probability distribution modeling. We prove that optimizing for information transmission does not guarantee optimal probability distribution modeling in general. We illustrate, using a two-pixel (2D) system and image patches, that an efficient representation can be realized through a nonlinear population code driven by two types of biologically plausible loss functions that depend solely on output. After unsupervised learning, our abstract information processing model bears remarkable resemblances to biological systems, despite not mimicking many features of real neurons, such as spiking activity. A preliminary comparison with a contemporary deep learning model suggests that our model offers a significant efficiency advantage. Our model provides novel insights into the computational theory of early visual systems as well as a potential new approach to enhance the efficiency of deep learning models.</description>
