      <title>Multiscale 2-Mapper -- Exploratory Data Analysis Guided by the First Betti Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mapper algorithm is a fundamental tool in exploratory topological data analysis for identifying connectivity and topological clustering in data. Derived from the nerve construction, Mapper graphs can contain additional information about clustering density when considering the higher-dimensional skeleta. To observe two-dimensional features, and capture one-dimensional topology, we construct 2-Mapper. A common issue in using Mapper algorithms is parameter choice. We develop tools to choose 2-Mapper parameters that reflect persistent Betti-1 information. Computationally, we study how cover choice affects 2-Mapper and analyze this through a computational Multiscale Mapper algorithm. We test our constructions on three-dimensional shape data, including the Klein bottle.</description>

      <title>The Road to the Closest Point is Paved by Good Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\renewcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}$Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\Re^d$, and a parameter $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, we present a new construction of a directed graph $G$, of size $O(n/\varepsilon^d)$, such that $(1+\varepsilon)$-ANN queries can be answered by performing a greedy walk on $G$, repeatedly moving to a neighbor that is (significantly) better than the current point. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of a linear size with no dependency on the spread of the point set. The resulting query time, is $O( \varepsilon^{-d} \log \Psi)$, where $\Psi$ is the spread of $P$. The new construction is surprisingly simple and should be practical.</description>

      <title>Interleaving Distance as an Edit distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of edit distance, which dates back to the 1960s in the context of comparing word strings, has since found numerous applications with various adaptations in computer science, computational biology, and applied topology. By contrast, the interleaving distance, introduced in the 2000s within the study of persistent homology, has become a foundational metric in topological data analysis. In this work, we show that the interleaving distance on finitely presented single- and multi-parameter persistence modules can be formulated as an edit distance. The key lies in clarifying a connection between the Galois connection and the interleaving distance, via the established relation between the interleaving distance and free presentations of persistence modules. In addition to offering new perspectives on the interleaving distance, we expect that our findings facilitate the study of stability properties of invariants of multi-parameter persistence modules.</description>

      <title>TACO-Net: Topological Signatures Triumph in 3D Object Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next, we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework, TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$ accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs, the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.</description>

      <title>Gromov's Approximating Tree and the All-Pairs Bottleneck Paths Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a pointed metric space $(X,\mathsf{dist}, w)$ on $n$ points, its Gromov's approximating tree is a 0-hyperbolic pseudo-metric space $(X,\mathsf{dist}_T)$ such that $\mathsf{dist}(x,w)=\mathsf{dist}_T(x,w)$ and $\mathsf{dist}(x, y)-2 \delta \log_2n \leq \mathsf{dist}_T (x, y) \leq \mathsf{dist}(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$ where $\delta$ is the Gromov hyperbolicity of $X$. On the other hand, the all pairs bottleneck paths (APBP) problem asks, given an undirected graph with some capacities on its edges, to find the maximal path capacity between each pair of vertices. In this note, we prove:
  $\bullet$ Computing Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with $n+1$ points from its matrix of distances reduces to solving the APBP problem on an connected graph with $n$ vertices.
  $\bullet$ There is an explicit algorithm that computes Gromov's approximating tree for a graph from its adjacency matrix in quadratic time.
  $\bullet$ Solving the APBP problem on a weighted graph with $n$ vertices reduces to finding Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with $n+1$ points from its distance matrix.</description>

      <title>Constant Workspace Algorithms for Computing Relative Hulls in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constant workspace algorithms use a constant number of words in addition to the read-only input to the algorithm. In this paper, we devise algorithms to efficiently compute relative hulls in the plane using a constant workspace. Specifically, we devise algorithms for the following three problems: (i) Given two simple polygons P and Q with P \subset Q, compute a simple polygon P' with a perimeter of minimum length such that P \subseteq P' \subseteq Q. (ii) Given two simple polygons P and Q such that Q does not intersect the relative interior of P but it does intersect the relative interior of the convex hull of P, compute a weakly simple polygon P' with a perimeter of minimum length such that P \subseteq P', the convex hull of P contains P', and P' does not intersect the relative interior of Q. (iii) Given a set S of points located in a simple polygon P, compute a weakly simple polygon P' with a perimeter of minimum length such that P' \subseteq P and P' contains all the points in S. To our knowledge, no prior work devised algorithms to compute relative hulls using a constant workspace, and this work is the first such attempt.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis Of Heuristic and Approximation Algorithms for the The Mutual-Visibility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms -- a direct random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm -- on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Geometry from Optimization in 2D Irregular Cutting and Packing Problems: an Open-Source Collision Detection Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing irregular cutting and packing (C&amp;P) optimization problems poses two distinct challenges: the geometric challenge of determining whether or not an item can be placed feasibly at a certain position, and the optimization challenge of finding a good solution according to some objective function. Until now, those tackling such problems have had to address both challenges simultaneously, requiring two distinct sets of expertise and a lot of research &amp; development effort. One way to lower this barrier is to decouple the two challenges. In this paper we introduce a powerful collision detection engine (CDE) for 2D irregular C&amp;P problems which assumes full responsibility for the geometric challenge. The CDE (i) allows users to focus with full confidence on their optimization challenge by abstracting geometry away and (ii) enables independent advances to propagate to all optimization algorithms built atop it. We present a set of core principles and design philosophies to model a general and adaptable CDE focused on maximizing performance, accuracy and robustness. These principles are accompanied by a concrete open-source implementation called $\texttt{jagua-rs}$. This paper together with its implementation serves as a catalyst for future advances in irregular C&amp;P problems by providing a solid foundation which can either be used as it currently exists or be further improved upon.</description>

      <title>The Stamp Folding Problem From a Mountain-Valley Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strip of square stamps can be folded in many ways such that all of the stamps are stacked in a single pile in the folded state. The stamp folding problem asks for the number of such foldings and has previously been studied extensively. We consider this problem with the additional restriction of fixing the mountain-valley assignment of each crease in the stamp pattern. We provide a closed form for counting the number of legal foldings on specific patterns of mountain-valley assignments, including a surprising appearance of the Catalan numbers. We describe results on upper and lower bounds for the number of ways to fold a given mountain-valley assignment on the strip of stamps, provide experimental evidence suggesting more general results, and include conjectures and open problems.</description>
