      <title>Free products of bi-orderable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a bi-ordered version of Rivas' result for free products of left-order groups. Namely, we show that a free product of bi-ordered groups does not admit isolated bi-ordering. Our method relies on the dynamical realization of bi-ordered groups. We also show that the natural action of the automorphism group $Aut(F_2)$ on $F_2$ does not have dense orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The show that the upper-left-corner problem and upper-right-corner problem for matrix groups with rational entries are undecidable. To reach this aim, we answer a question of Dixon from 1985 by proving the undecidability of the stabilizer problem for matrix groups.</description>

      <title>$p$-groups with small number of character degrees and their normal subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $G$ be a finite $p$-group and $\chi$ is a non-linear irreducible character of $G$, then $\chi(1)\leq |G/Z(G)|^{\frac{1}{2}}$. In \cite{fernandez2001groups}, Fern\'{a}ndez-Alcober and Moret\'{o} obtained the relation between the character degree set of a finite $p$-group $G$ and its normal subgroups depending on whether $|G/Z(G)|$ is a square or not. In this paper we investigate the finite $p$-group $G$ where for any normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ with $G'\not \leq N$ either $N\leq Z(G)$ or $|NZ(G)/Z(G)|\leq p$ and obtain some alternate characterizations of such groups. We find that if $G$ is a finite $p$-group with $|G/Z(G)|=p^{2n+1}$ and $G$ satisfies the condition that for any normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ either $G'\not \leq N$ or $N\leq Z(G)$, then $cd(G)=\{1, p^{n}\}$. We also find that if $G$ is a finite $p$-group with nilpotency class not equal to $3$ and $|G/Z(G)|=p^{2n}$ and $G$ satisfies the condition that for any normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ either $G'\not \leq N$ or $|NZ(G)/Z(G)|\leq p$, then $cd(G) \subseteq \{1, p^{n-1}, p^{n}\}$.</description>

      <title>Classification of right nilpotent $\mathbb{F}_p$-braces of cardinality $p^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article the right nilpotent $\mathbb{F}_p$-braces of cardinality $p^5$ has been classified. We use the connection between nilpotent $\mathbb{F}_p$-braces of cardinality $p^5$ and nilpotent pre-Lie algebras of the same order, building on the known relationship between pre-Lie algebras and braces. Leveraging insights from the classification of nilpotent pre-Lie algebras over $\mathbb{F}_p$, we aim to provide a comprehensive classification of right nilpotent $\mathbb{F}_p$-braces of cardinality $p^5$.</description>

      <title>Almost invariant CND kernels and proper uniformly Lipschitz actions on subspaces of $L^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12949v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the notion of almost invariant conditionally negative definite kernel and use it to give a characterisation of groups admitting a proper uniformly Lipschitz affine action on a subspace of an $L^1$ space. We show that this condition is satisfied by groups acting properly on products of quasi-trees, weakly amenable groups with Cowling-Haagerup constant 1, and a-TTT-menable groups.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Proof that Many Groups with Non-Torsion 2-Cohomology are Not Matricially Stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10354v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete group is matricially stable if every function from the group to a complex unitary group that is "almost multiplicative" in the point-operator norm topology is "close" to a genuine unitary representation. It follows from a recent result due to Dadarlat that all amenable, groups with non-torsion integral 2-cohomology are not matricially stable, but the proof does not lead to explicit examples of asymptotic representations that are not perturbable to genuine representations. The purpose of this paper is to give an explicit formula, in terms of cohomological data, for asymptotic representations that are not perturbable to genuine representations for a class of groups that contains all finitely generated groups with a non-torsion 2-cohomology class that corresponds to a central extension where the middle group is residually finite. This class includes polycyclic groups with non-torsion 2-cohomology.</description>

      <title>On the order sequence of a group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a bridge between two active areas of research, the spectrum (set of element orders) and the power graph of a finite group.
  The order sequence of a finite group $G$ is the list of orders of elements of the group, arranged in non-decreasing order. Order sequences of groups of order $n$ are ordered by elementwise domination, forming a partially ordered set. We prove a number of results about this poset, among them the following.
  M.~Amiri recently proved that the poset has a unique maximal element, corresponding to the cyclic group. We show that the product of orders in a cyclic group of order $n$ is at least $q^{\phi(n)}$ times as large as the product in any non-cyclic group,where $q$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$ and $\phi$ is Euler's function, with a similar result for the sum.
  The poset of order sequences of abelian groups of order $p^n$ is naturally isomorphic to the (well-studied) poset of partitions of $n$ with its natural partial order.
  If there exists a non-nilpotent group of order $n$, then there exists such a group whose order sequence is dominated by the order sequence of any nilpotent group of order $n$.
  There is a product operation on finite ordered sequences, defined by forming all products and sorting them into non-decreasing order. The product of order sequences of groups $G$ and $H$ is the order sequence of a group if and only if $|G|$ and $|H|$ are coprime.
  The paper concludes with a number of open problems.</description>

      <title>Finite almost simple groups whose holomorph contains a solvable regular subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper, we gave a complete list of the finite non-abelian simple groups whose holomorph contains a solvable regular subgroup. In this paper, we refine our previous work by considering all finite almost simple groups. In particular, our result yields a complete characterization of the finite almost simple groups which occur as the type of a Hopf-Galois structure on a solvable extension, or equivalently, the additive group of a skew brace having a solvable multiplicative group.</description>

      <title>Maximal ideals of reduced group C*-algebras and Thompson's groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a conditional expectation $P$ from a C*-algebra $B$ onto a C*-subalgebra $A$, we observe that induction of ideals via $P$, together with a map which we call co-induction, forms a Galois connection between the lattices of ideals of $A$ and $B$. Using properties of this Galois connection, we show that, given a discrete group $G$ and a stabilizer subgroup $G_x$ for the action of $G$ on its Furstenberg boundary, induction gives a bijection between the set of maximal co-induced ideals of $C^*(G_x)$ and the set of maximal ideals of $C^*_r(G)$.
  As an application, we prove that the reduced C*-algebra of Thompson's group $T$ has a unique maximal ideal. Furthermore, we show that, if Thompson's group $F$ is amenable, then $C^*_r(T)$ has infinitely many ideals.</description>
