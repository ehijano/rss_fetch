      <title>A non-ordinary (prime) note</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a newform with the Fourier expansion $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b(n)q^n\in\mathbb Z[[q]]$, a prime $p$ is said to be non-ordinary if $p\mid b(p)$. We exemplify several newforms of weight 4 for which the latter divisibility implies a stronger divisibility - a property that may be thought unlikely to happen too often.</description>

      <title>The behaviour of a certain additive function in large intervals between consecutive primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of a certain additive function depending on prime divisors of specific integers lying in large gaps between consecutive primes. The result is obtained by a combination of results and ideas related to large gaps between primes and the Erd\"os-Kac theorem, especially the Kubilius model from Probabilistic Number Theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep conjecture of Montgomery and Soundararajan on the distribution of prime numbers in short intervals of length $h$ says that the third moment is bounded by $\ll h^{\frac {3}{2}-c}$ for some $c&gt;0$. There is in the literature some conditional evidence towards this conjecture whilst in the first article to this series we gave the first instance of unconditional evidence in the form of a bound corresponding to $\ll h^{7/5+o(1)}$. In this article we push the exponent down to $\ll h^{1+o(1)}$ which more or less is expected to be best possible.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Heights of $2$-isogeny Graphs in Ordinary Curves over $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ and Its Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that any isogeny graph consisting of ordinary elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q = p$ or $p^2$ has a special structure, called a volcano graph. We have a bound $h &lt; \log_2 \sqrt{4q}$ of a height $h$ of the $2$-volcano graph. In this paper, we improve the bound on a height of $2$-volcano graphs over $\mathbb{F}_q$. In case $q = p^2$, we show a tighter bound $h \leq \left\lfloor \frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \lfloor \log_2 p \rfloor \right\rfloor + 2 $. In case $q = p$, we also show that a good bound for each prime $p$ can be computed by using our proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Fractal geometry of continued fractions with large coefficients and dimension drop problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1928, Jarn\'{\i}k \cite{Jar} obtained that the set of continued fractions with bounded coefficients has Hausdorff dimension one. Good \cite{Goo} observed a dimension drop phenomenon by proving that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of continued fractions whose coefficients tend to infinity is one-half. For the set of continued fractions whose coefficients tend to infinity rapidly, Luczak \cite{Luc} and Feng et al. \cite{FWLT} showed that its Hausdorff dimension decreases even further. Recently, Liao and Rams \cite{LR16} also observed an analogous dimension drop phenomenon when they studied the subexponential growth rate of the sum of coefficients.
  In this paper, we consolidate and considerably extend the studies of the abovementioned problem into a general dimension drop problem on the distribution of continued fractions with large coefficients. As applications, we use a different approach to reprove a result of Wang and Wu on the dimensions of the Borel-Bernstein sets \cite{WW}, fulfil the dimension gap proposed by Liao and Rams \cite{LR16}, and establish several new results concerning the dimension theory of liminf and limsup sets related to the maximum of coefficients.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Points for Density Modulo 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that almost every dilation of a sequence of real numbers, that diverges to $\infty$, is dense modulo~1. This paper studies the exceptional set of points -- those for which the dilation is not dense. Specifically, we consider the Hausdorff and modified box dimensions of the set of exceptional points. In particular, we show that the dimension of this set may be any number between 0 and 1. Similar results are obtained for two ``natural'' subsets of the set of exceptional points. Furthermore, the paper calculates the dimension of several sets of points, defined by certain constraints on their binary expansion.</description>

      <title>Functional equation for LC-functions with even or odd modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, we introduced \textit{LC-functions} $L(s,f)$, associated to a certain real-analytic function $f$ at $0$, extending the concept of the Hurwitz zeta function and its formula. In this paper, we establish the existence of a functional equation for a specific class of LC-functions. More precisely, we demonstrate that if the function $p_f(t):=f(t)(e^t-1)/t$, called the \textit{modulator} of $L(s,f)$, exhibits even or odd symmetry, the \textit{LC-function formula} -- a generalization of the Hurwitz formula -- naturally simplifies to a functional equation analogous to that of the Dirichlet L-function $L(s,\chi)$, associated to a primitive character $\chi$ of inherent parity. Furthermore, using this equation, we derive a general formula for the values of these LC-functions at even or odd positive integers, depending on whether the modulator $p_f$ is even or odd, respectively. Two illustrative examples of the functional equation are provided for distinct parity of modulators.</description>

      <title>Near coincidences and nilpotent division fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve. We say that $E$ has a near coincidence of level $(n,m)$ if $m \mid n$ and $\mathbb{Q}(E[n]) = \mathbb{Q}(E[m],\zeta_{n})$. In the present paper we classify near coincidences of prime power level. We use this result to give a classification of values of $n$ for which ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ is a nilpotent group. In particular, if we assume that there are no non-CM rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^{+}(p)$ for primes $p &gt; 11$, then ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ nilpotent implies that $n$ is a power of $2$ or $n \in \{ 3, 5, 6, 7, 15, 21 \}$.</description>

      <title>$M$-functions and screw functions originating from Goldbach's problem and zeros of the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $M$-functions, which describe the limit theorem for the value-distributions of the secondary main terms in the asymptotic formulas for the summatory functions of the Goldbach counting function. One of the new aspects is a sufficient condition for the Riemann hypothesis provided by some formulas of the $M$-functions, which was a necessary condition in previous work. The other new aspect is the relation between the secondary main terms and the screw functions, which provides another necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemann hypothesis. We study such $M$-functions and screw functions in generalized settings by axiomatizing them.</description>

      <title>Shadow line distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ with Mordell--Weil rank $2$ and $p$ be an odd prime of good ordinary reduction. For every imaginary quadratic field $K$ satisfying the Heegner hypothesis, there is (subject to the Shafarevich--Tate conjecture) a line, i.e., a free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-submodule of rank $1$, in $ E(K)\otimes \mathbb{Z}_p$ given by universal norms coming from the Mordell--Weil groups of subfields of the anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$; we call it the {\it shadow line}. When the twist of $E$ by $K$ has analytic rank $1$, the shadow line is conjectured to lie in $E(\mathbb{Q})\otimes\mathbb{Z}_p$; we verify this computationally in all our examples. We study the distribution of shadow lines in $E(\mathbb{Q})\otimes\mathbb{Z}_p$ as $K$ varies, framing conjectures based on the computations we have made.</description>

      <title>Random $p$-adic matrices with fixed zero entries and the Cohen--Lenstra distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of the cokernels of random $p$-adic matrices with fixed zero entries. Let $X_n$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ in which some entries are fixed to be zero and the other entries are i.i.d. copies of a random variable $\xi \in \mathbb{Z}_p$. We consider the minimal number of random entries of $X_n$ required for the cokernel of $X_n$ to converge to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution. When $\xi$ is given by the Haar measure, we prove a lower bound of the number of random entries and prove its converse-type result using random regular bipartite multigraphs. When $\xi$ is a general random variable, we determine the minimal number of random entries. Let $M_n$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with $k$-step stairs of zeros and the other entries given by independent random $\epsilon$-balanced variables valued in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We prove that the cokernel of $M_n$ converges to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution under a mild assumption. This extends Wood's universality theorem on random $p$-adic matrices.</description>

      <title>Zeta elements for elliptic curves and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ with conductor $N$ and $p\nmid 2N$ a prime. Let $L$ be an imaginary quadratic field with $p$ split. We prove the existence of $p$-adic zeta element for $E$ over $L$, encoding two different $p$-adic $L$-functions associated to $E$ over $L$ via explicit reciprocity laws at the primes above $p$. We formulate a main conjecture for $E$ over $L$ in terms of the zeta element, mediating different main conjectures in which the $p$-adic $L$-functions appear, and prove some results toward them.
  The zeta element has various applications to the arithmetic of elliptic curves. This includes a proof of main conjecture for semistable elliptic curves $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ at supersingular primes $p$, as conjectured by Kobayashi in 2002. It leads to the $p$-part of the conjectural Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) formula for such curves of analytic rank zero or one, and enables us to present the first infinite families of non-CM elliptic curves for which the BSD conjecture is true. We provide further evidence towards the BSD conjecture: new cases of $p$-converse to the Gross--Zagier and Kolyvagin theorem, and $p$-part of the BSD formula for ordinary primes $p$. Along the way, we give a proof of a conjecture of Perrin-Riou connecting Beilinson--Kato elements with rational points.</description>

      <title>Exceptional zeros for Heegner points and $p$-converse to the theorem of Gross-Zagier and Kolyvagin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a $p$-converse to the theorem of Gross-Zagier and Kolyvagin for elliptic curves $E/\mathbf{Q}$ at primes $p&gt;3$ of multiplicative reduction. Two key ingredients in the argument are an extension to this setting of a $p$-adic formula of Bertolini-Darmon-Prasanna obtained in our earlier work, and an exceptional zero formula for Heegner points.
  By independent approaches different from ours, a similar $p$-converse theorem was obtained by Skinner--Zhang under additional ramification hypotheses on $E[p]$, and by Venerucci assuming finiteness of the $p$-primary part of the Tate-Shafarevich group.</description>

      <title>Isogeny relations in products of families of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E_{\lambda}$ be the Legendre family of elliptic curves with equation $Y^2=X(X-1)(X-\lambda)$. Given a curve $\mathcal{C}$, satisfying a condition on the degrees of some of its coordinates and parametrizing $m$ points $P_1, \ldots, P_m \in E_{\lambda}$ and $n$ points $Q_1, \ldots, Q_n \in E_{\mu}$ and assuming that those points are generically linearly independent over the generic endomorphism ring, we prove that there are at most finitely many points $\mathbf{c}_0$ on $\mathcal{C}$, such that there exists an isogeny $\phi: E_{\mu(\mathbf{c}_0)} \rightarrow E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)}$ and the $m+n$ points $P_1(\mathbf{c}_0), \ldots, P_m(\mathbf{c}_0), \phi(Q_1(\mathbf{c}_0)), \ldots, \phi(Q_n(\mathbf{c}_0)) \in E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)}$ are linearly dependent over $\mathrm{End}(E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)})$.</description>

      <title>The sixth moment of Dirichlet L-functions at the central point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1970, Huxley obtained a sharp upper bound for the sixth moment of Dirichlet $L$-functions at the central point, averaged over primitive characters $\chi$ modulo $q$ and all moduli $q \leq Q$. In 2007, as an application of their ``asymptotic large sieve'', Conrey, Iwaniec and Soundararajan showed that when an additional short $t$-averaging is introduced into the problem, an asymptotic can be obtained. In this paper we show that this extraneous averaging can be removed, and we thus obtain an asymptotic for the original moment problem considered by Huxley.
  The main new difficulty in our work is the appearance of certain challenging ``unbalanced'' sums that arise as soon as the $t$-aspect averaging is removed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new upper bound on the number of pairs of commuting $n\times n$ matrices with integer entries in $[-T,T]$, as $T\to \infty$. We reduce the dimension growth bound of Salberger by $T^{\alpha(n)}$ for $n\ge 15$, where $\alpha(n) \sim \frac{12}{\sqrt{n}}$. We relate the problem to the hypothetical flatness of a Lie bracket, a multiplicative analogue of which was proven by Larsen and Lu.</description>

      <title>On the gcd graphs over polynomial rings and related topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gcd-graphs over the ring of integers modulo $n$ are a natural generalization of unitary Cayley graphs. The study of these graphs has foundations in various mathematical fields, including number theory, ring theory, and representation theory. Using the theory of Ramanujan sums, it is known that these gcd-graphs have integral spectra; i.e., all their eigenvalues are integers. In this work, inspired by the analogy between number fields and function fields, we define and study gcd-graphs over polynomial rings with coefficients in finite fields. We establish some fundamental properties of these graphs, emphasizing their analogy to their counterparts over $\mathbb{Z}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $A=\{a_1,\dots ,a_{|A|}\}\subset \{1,2,\dots ,n\}$ is a Sidon set so that $|A|=n^{1/2}-L^\prime$, then $$a_m = m\cdot n^{1/2} + \mathcal O\left( n^{7/8}\right) + \mathcal O\left(L^{1/2}\cdot n^{3/4}\right)$$ where $L=\max\{0,L^\prime\}$. As an application of this, we give easy proofs of some previously derived results. We proceed on to proving that for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we have $$\sum_{a\in S} a = \frac 12 n^{3/2} + \mathcal O \left (n^{11/8} \right )$$ for all $n\le N$ but at most $\mathcal O_{\varepsilon} \left (N^{\frac 35 + \varepsilon} \right )$ exceptions.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Gireesh, Ray, and Shivashankar studied an analog, $\overline{a}_t(n)$, of the $t$-core partition function, $c_t(n)$. In this paper, we study the function $\overline{a}_5(n)$ in conjunction with $c_5(n)$ as well as another analogous function $\overline{b}_5(n)$. We also find several arithmetic identities for $\overline{a}_5(n)$ and $\overline{b}_5(n)$.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the solutions to the Diophantine equations $F_n = 2^k (2^m - 1)$ and $F_n = 5^k (5^m - 1)$, where $F_n$ represents the Fibonacci numbers defined by the recurrence relation $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$, and $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 2$. By leveraging Matveev's theorem, which provides lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms, along with a modified Baker-Davenport reduction technique and the divisibility properties of Fibonacci numbers, we thoroughly characterize all positive integer solutions $(n, k, m)$ that satisfy these equations.</description>

Abstract: Under the Riemann hypothesis and the simplicity of the nontrivial zeros $\rho_{n}=1/2\pm i\gamma_{n}$ of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ we show that $$ \frac{1}{\left|\zeta'\left(\rho_{n}\right)\right|}=O\left(\frac{\gamma_{n}}{n^{1/4-\varepsilon}}\right)=O\left(\frac{n^{3/4+\varepsilon}}{\log n}\right) $$ for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$.

Abstract: Generating functions of BPS indices, counting states of D4-D2-D0 black holes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identified with rank 0 Donaldson- Thomas invariants, are examples of mock modular forms. They have a quite complicated modular anomaly expressed as a sum over three different types of trees weighted by generalized error functions and their derivatives. We show that this anomaly can be significantly simplified, which in turn simplfies finding the corresponding mock modular generating functions.</description>

      <title>Casting more light in the shadows: dual Somos-5 sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the search for an appropriate notion of a cluster superalgebra, incorporating Grassmann variables, Ovsienko and Tabachnikov considered the extension of various recurrence relations with the Laurent phenomenon to the ring of dual numbers. Furthermore, by iterating recurrences with specific numerical values, some particular well-known integer sequences, such as the Fibonacci sequence, Markoff numbers, and Somos sequences, were shown to produce associated ``shadow'' sequences when they were extended to the dual numbers. Here we consider the most general version of the Somos-5 recurrence defined over the ring of dual numbers $\mathbb{D}$ with complex coefficients, that is the ring $\mathbb{C}[\varepsilon]$ modulo the relation $\varepsilon^2=0$. We present three different ways to present the general solution of the initial value problem for Somos-5 and its shadow part: in analytic form, using the Weierstrass sigma function with arguments in $\mathbb{D}$; in terms of the solution of a linear difference equation; and using Hankel determinants constructed from $\mathbb{D}$-valued moments, via a connection with a Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) map over the dual numbers.</description>

Abstract: Yuan and Zhang introduced arithmetic intersection numbers for adelic line bundles on quasi-projective varieties over a number field. Burgos and Kramer generalized this approach allowing more singular metrics at archimedean places. We introduce abstract divisorial spaces as a tool to generalize these arithmetic intersection numbers to the setting of a proper adelic base curve in the sense of Chen and Moriwaki. We also allow more singular metrics at non-archimedean places using relative mixed energy there as well.</description>

      <title>Completing the picture for the Skolem Problem on order-4 linear recurrence sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For almost a century, the decidability of the Skolem Problem - that is, the problem of finding whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term - has remained open. A breakthrough in the 1980s established that the Skolem Problem is indeed decidable for algebraic LRS of order at most 3, and real algebraic LRS of order at most 4. However, for general algebraic LRS of order 4 the question of decidability has remained open. Our main contribution in this paper is to prove decidability for this last case, i.e. we show that the Skolem Problem is decidable for all algebraic LRS of order at most 4.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci Partial Sums Tricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following magic trick is at the center of this paper. While the audience writes the first ten terms of a Fibonacci-like sequence (the sequence following the same recursion as the Fibonacci sequence), the magician calculates the sum of these ten terms very fast by multiplying the 7th term by 11. This trick is based on the divisibility properties of partial sums of Fibonacci-like sequences. We find the maximum Fibonacci number that divides the sum of the Fibonacci numbers 1 through $n$. We discuss the generalization of the trick for other second-order recurrences. We show that a similar trick exists for Pell-like sequences and does not exist for Jacobhstal-like sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Merca and Schmidt found some decompositions for the partition function $p(n)$ in terms of the classical M\"{o}bius function as well as Euler's totient. In this paper, we define a counting function $T_k^r(m)$ on the set of $n$-color partitions of $m$ for given positive integers $k, r$ and relate the function with the $n$-color partition function and other well-known arithmetic functions like the M\"obius function, Liouville function, etc. and their divisor sums. Furthermore, we use a counting method of Erd\"os to obtain some counting theorems for $n$-color partitions that are analogous to those found by Andrews and Deutsch for the partition function.</description>

      <title>Moments of characteristic polynomials and their derivatives for $SO(2N)$ and $USp(2N)$ and their application to one-level density in families of elliptic curve $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the ratios theorems, we calculate the leading order terms in $N$ for the following averages of the characteristic polynomial and its derivative: $\left&lt; \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right&gt;_{SO(2N)}$ and $\left&lt; \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right&gt;_{USp(2N)}$. Our expression, derived for integer $r$, permits analytic continuation in $r$ and we conjecture that this agrees with the above averages for non-integer exponents. We use this result to obtain an expression for the one level density of the `excised ensemble', a subensemble of $SO(2N)$, to next-to-leading order in $N$. We then present the analogous calculation for the one level density of quadratic twists of elliptic curve $L$-functions, taking into account a number theoretical bound on the central values of the $L$-functions. The method we use to calculate the above random matrix averages uses the contour integral form of the ratios theorems, which are a key tool in the growing literature on averages of characteristic polynomials and their derivatives, and as we evaluate the next-to-leading term for large matrix size $N$, this leads to some multi-dimensional contour integrals that are slightly asymmetric in the integration variables, which might be useful in other work.</description>

      <title>On the prismatization of $O_K$ beyond the Hodge-Tate locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X=\mathrm{Spf}(\mathcal{O}_K)$. We classify perfect complexes of $n$-truncated prismatic crystals on the prismatic site of $X$ when $n\leq 1+\frac{p-1}{e}$ by studying perfect complexes on the $n$-truncated prismatization of $X$, which are certain nilpotent thickenings of the Hodge-Tate stack of $X$ inside the prismatization of $X$. We describe the category of continuous semilinear representations and their cohomology for $G_K$ with coefficients in $B_{\mathrm{dR},n}^+$ via rationalization of vector bundles on the slight shrinking of the $n$-truncated prismatization of $X$. Along the way, we classify certain integral models for de Rham prismatic crystals studied in arXiv:2205.14914.</description>

      <title>The twisted second moment of modular half integral weight $L$--functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.03416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a half-integral weight holomorphic Kohnen newform $f$ on $\Gamma_0(4)$, we prove an asymptotic formula for large primes $p$ with power saving error term for \begin{equation*} \sideset{}{^*} \sum_{\chi \hspace{-0.15cm} \pmod{p}} | L(1/2,f,\chi) |^2. \end{equation*} Our result is unconditional, it does not rely on the Ramanujan--Petersson conjecture for the form $f$. This gives a very sharp Lindel\"{o}f on average result for Dirichlet series attached to Hecke eigenforms without an Euler product. The Lindel\"{o}f hypothesis for such series was originally conjectured by Hoffstein. There are two main inputs. The first is a careful spectral analysis of a highly unbalanced shifted convolution problem involving the Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight forms. The second input is a bound for sums of products of Sali\'{e} sums in the Polya--Vinogradov range. Half--integrality is fully exploited to establish such an estimate. We use the closed form evaluation of the Sali\'{e} sum to relate our problem to the sequence $\alpha n^2 \pmod{1}$. Our treatment of this sequence is inspired by work of Rudnick--Sarnak and the second author on the local spacings of $\alpha n^2$ modulo one.</description>

      <title>Most Odd-Degree Binary Forms Fail to Primitively Represent a Square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.12409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a separable integral binary form of odd degree $N \geq 5$. A result of Darmon and Granville known as ``Faltings plus epsilon'' implies that the degree-$N$ \emph{superelliptic equation} $y^2 = F(x,z)$ has finitely many primitive integer solutions. In this paper, we consider the family $\mathscr{F}_N(f_0)$ of degree-$N$ superelliptic equations with fixed leading coefficient $f_0 \in \mathbb{Z} \smallsetminus \pm\mathbb{Z}^2$, ordered by height. For every sufficiently large $N$, we prove that among equations in the family $\mathscr{F}_N(f_0)$, more than $74.9\%$ are insoluble, and more than $71.8\%$ are everywhere locally soluble but fail the Hasse principle due to the Brauer--Manin obstruction. We further show that these proportions rise to at least $99.9\%$ and $96.7\%$, respectively, when $f_0$ has sufficiently many prime divisors of odd multiplicity. Our result can be viewed as a strong asymptotic form of ``Faltings plus epsilon'' for superelliptic equations and constitutes an analogue of Bhargava's result that most hyperelliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ have no rational points.</description>

      <title>Mod $p$ points on Shimura varieties of parahoric level (with an appendix by Rong Zhou)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.10496v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mod $p$-points of the Kisin--Pappas integral models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type with parahoric level. We show that if the group is quasi-split, then every isogeny class contains the reduction of a CM point, proving a conjecture of Kisin--Madapusi-Pera--Shin. We furthermore show that the mod $p$ isogeny classes are of the form predicted by the Langlands--Rapoport conjecture if either the Shimura variety is proper or if the group at $p$ is unramified. The main ingredient in our work is a global argument that allows us to reduce the conjecture to the case of very special parahoric level. This case is dealt with in the appendix by Rong Zhou. As a corollary to our arguments, we determine the connected components of Ekedahl--Oort strata.</description>

      <title>A new parametrization for ideal classes in rings defined by binary forms, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.13578v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a parametrization of square roots of the ideal class of the inverse different of rings defined by binary forms in terms of the orbits of a coregular representation. This parametrization, which can be construed as a new integral model of a ``higher composition law'' discovered by Bhargava and generalized by Wood, was the missing ingredient needed to solve a range of previously intractable open problems concerning distributions of class groups, Selmer groups, and related objects. For instance, in this paper, we apply the parametrization to bound the average size of the $2$-class group in families of number fields defined by binary $n$-ic forms, where $n \geq 3$ is an arbitrary integer, odd or even; in the paper [41], we applied it to prove that most integral odd-degree binary forms fail to primitively represent a square; and in the paper [11], joint with Bhargava and Shankar, we applied it to bound the second moment of the size of the $2$-Selmer group of elliptic curves.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we develop new methods for counting integral orbits having bounded invariants that lie inside the cusps of fundamental domains for coregular representations.

      <title>The mean number of $2$-torsion elements in the class groups of cubic orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the mean number of 2-torsion elements in class groups of cubic orders, when such orders are enumerated by discriminant. Specifically, we prove that when isomorphism classes of totally real (resp., complex) cubic orders are enumerated by discriminant, the average $2$-torsion in the class group is $1 + \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{\zeta(2)}{\zeta(4)}$ (resp., $1 + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{\zeta(2)}{\zeta(4)}$). In particular, we find that the average $2$-torsion in the class group increases when one ranges over all orders in cubic fields instead of restricting to the subfamily of rings of integers of cubic fields, where the average $2$-torsion in the class group was first determined in work of Bhargava to be $\frac{5}{4}$ (resp., $\frac{3}{2}$).
  By work of Bhargava--Varma, proving this result amounts to obtaining an asymptotic count of the number of "reducible" $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$-orbits on the space $\mathbb{Z}^2 \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \operatorname{Sym}^2 \mathbb{Z}^3$ of $3 \times 3$ symmetric integer matrices having bounded invariants and satisfying local conditions. In this paper, we resolve the generalization of this orbit-counting problem where the dimension $3$ is replaced by any fixed odd integer $N \geq 3$. More precisely, we determine asymptotic formulas for the number of reducible $\operatorname{SL}_N(\mathbb{Z})$-orbits on $\mathbb{Z}^2 \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \operatorname{Sym}^2 \mathbb{Z}^N$ satisfying general infinite sets of congruence conditions.</description>

Abstract: Let $L$ be a differential operator with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}(z)$ of order $n\geq2$ with maximal unipotent monodromy at zero. In this paper we are interested in determining when the canonical coordinate of $L$ belongs to $\mathbb{Z}_p[[z]]$. For this purpose, motivated by a recent conjecture due to P. Candelas, X. de la Ossa and D. van Straten~\cite{CD}, we study the situation when $L$ has a strong Frobenius structure $\Phi=(\phi_{i,j})_{1\leq i,j\leq n}\in M_n(\mathbb{Z}_p[[z]])$ such that $\phi_{1,1}(0)=1$. We then give a necessary and sufficient condition for the canonical coordinate of $L$ to belong to $\mathbb{Z}_p[[z]]$ when $L$ has such a strong Frobenius structure.</description>

      <title>A hyperelliptic saga on a generating function of the squares of Legendre polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We decompose the generating function $\sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{2n}nP_n(y)^2z^n$ of the squares of Legendre polynomials as a product of periods of hyperelliptic curves. These periods satisfy a family of $\textit{second}$ order differential equations. This is highly unusual since $\textit{four}$ is the expected order for genus 2. These second order equations are arithmetic and yet, surprisingly, their monodromy group is dense in $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. This suggests that they cannot be solved in terms of hypergeometric functions, which is novel for arithmetic second order differential equations that are $\textit{defined over}$ $\mathbb{Q}$, and also novel for a $\textit{family}$ of such equations. We complement our analysis with a recipe for constructing similar examples.

      <title>Diophantine tuples and multiplicative structure of shifted multiplicative subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the multiplicative structure of a shifted multiplicative subgroup and its connections with additive combinatorics and the theory of Diophantine equations. Among many new results, we highlight our main contributions as follows. First, we show that if a nontrivial shift of a multiplicative subgroup $G$ contains a product set $AB$, then $|A||B|$ is essentially bounded by $|G|$, refining a well-known consequence of a classical result by Vinogradov. Second, we provide a sharper upper bound of $M_k(n)$, the largest size of a set such that each pairwise product of its elements is $n$ less than a $k$-th power, refining the recent result of Dixit, Kim, and Murty. One main ingredient in our proof is the first non-trivial upper bound on the maximum size of a generalized Diophantine tuple over a finite field. In addition, we determine the maximum size of an infinite family of generalized Diophantine tuples over finite fields with square order, which is of independent interest. We also make significant progress towards a conjecture of S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy on the multiplicative decompositions of shifted multiplicative subgroups. In particular, we prove that for almost all primes $p$, the set $\{x^2-1: x \in \mathbb{F}_p^*\} \setminus \{0\}$ cannot be decomposed as the product of two sets in $\mathbb{F}_p$ non-trivially.</description>

Abstract: We study a new orthogonal family of $L$-functions associated with holomorphic Hecke newforms of level $q$, averaged over $q \asymp Q$. To illustrate our methods, we prove a one level density result for this family with the support of the Fourier transform of the test function being extended to be inside $(-4, 4)$. The main techniques developed in this paper will be useful in developing further results for this family, including estimates for high moments, information on the vertical distribution of zeros, as well as critical line theorems.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Time-Average along Uniformly Behaved in ${\mathbb N}$ Sequences on Every Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a uniformly behaved in ${\mathbb N}$ arithmetic sequence ${\bf a}$ and an ${\bf a}$-mean Lyapunov stable dynamical system $f$. We consider the time-average of a continuous function $\phi$ along the ${\bf a}$-orbit of $f$ up to $N$. The main result we prove in the paper is that this partial time-average converges for every point in the space if ${\bf a}$ is uniformly behaved in ${\mathbb N}$ and $f$ is minimal and uniquely ergodic and ${\bf a}$-mean Lyapunov stable. In addition, if ${\bf a}$ is also completely additive, we then prove that the time-average of a continuous function $\phi$ along the square-free ${\bf a}$-orbit of $f$ up to $N$ converges for every point in the space as well. All equicontinuous dynamical systems are ${\bf a}$-mean Lyapunov stable for any sequence ${\bf a}$. When ${\bf a}$ is a subsequence of ${\mathbb N}$ with positive lower density, we give two non-trivial examples of ${\bf a}$-mean Lyapunov stable dynamical systems. We give several examples of uniformly behaved in $\mathbb{N}$ sequences, including the counting function of the prime factors in natural numbers, the subsequence of natural numbers indexed by the Thue-Morse (or Rudin-Shapiro) sequence, and the sequence of even (or odd) prime factor natural numbers. We also show that the sequence of square-free natural numbers (or even (or odd) prime factor square-free natural numbers) is rotationally distributed in ${\mathbb N}$ but not uniformly distributed in ${\mathbb Z}$, thus not uniformly behaved in ${\mathbb N}$. We derive other consequences from the main result relevant to number theory and ergodic theory/dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: Let $k\geqslant 3$ and let $A=\{0=a_{0}&lt;a_{1}&lt;\cdots&lt;a_{k-1}\}$ with $\gcd(A)=1$. Freiman-Lev conjecture [V.F. Lev, Restricted set addition in groups, I. The classical setting, J. London Math. Soc. 62(2000), 27-40] is a well-known conjecture which related to restricted sumsets. Up to now, Freiman-Lev conjecture is open for all $a_{k-1}\geqslant 2k-2$. In this paper, we prove the Freiman-Lev conjecture is true for $a_{k-1}\geqslant 2k-2$ and $a_{k-2}&lt;2k-4$. That is, Freiman-Lev conjecture is still open for the case $a_{k-1}\geqslant 2k-2$ and $a_{k-2}\geq 2k-4$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal K$ be a field of formal Laurent series with coefficients in a finite field of characteristic $p$. For $M\ge 1$, let $\mathcal G_{&lt;p,M}$ be the maximal quotient of the Galois group of $\mathcal K$ of period $p^M$ and nilpotent class $&lt;p$ and $\{\mathcal G_{&lt;p,M}^{(v)}\}_{v\geqslant 0}$ -- the ramification subgroups in upper numbering. Let $\mathcal G_{&lt;p,M}=G(\mathcal L)$ be the identification of nilpotent Artin-Schreier theory: here $G(\mathcal L)$ is the group obtained from a suitable profinite Lie $\mathbb{Z}/p^M$-algebra $\mathcal L$ via the Campbell-Hausdorff composition law. We develop new techniques to obtain a ``geometrical'' construction of the ideals $\mathcal L^{(v)}$ such that $G(\mathcal L^{(v)})=\mathcal G_{&lt;p,M}^{(v)}$. Given $v_0\geqslant 1$, we construct a decreasing central filtration $\mathcal L(w)$, $1\leqslant w\leqslant p$, on $\mathcal L$, an epimorphism of Lie $\mathbb{Z}/p^M$-algebras $\bar{\mathcal V}:\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }\to \bar{\mathcal L}:=\mathcal L/\mathcal L(p)$, and a unipotent action $\Omega $ of $\mathbb{Z} /p^M$ on $\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }$, which induces the identity action on $\bar{\mathcal L}$. Suppose $d\Omega =B^{\dag }$, where $B^{\dag }\in\operatorname{Diff}\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }$, and $\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag [v_0]}$ is the ideal of $\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }$ generated by the elements of $B^{\dag }(\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag })$. Our main result states that the ramification ideal $\mathcal L^{(v_0)}$ appears as the preimage of the ideal in $\bar{\mathcal L}$ generated by $\bar{\mathcal V}B^{\dag }(\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag [v_0]})$. In the last section we apply this to the explicit construction of generators of $\bar{\mathcal L}^{(v_0)}$. The paper justifies a geometrical origin of ramification subgroups of $\Gamma _K$ and can be used for further developing of non-abelian local class field theory.</description>

Abstract: Let $f$ be a normalized newform of weight 2 on $\Gamma_0(N)$ whose coefficients lie in $\mathbb{Q}$ and let $\chi_M$ be a primitive quadratic Dirichlet character with conductor $M$. In this paper, under mild assumptions on $M$, we give a sharp lower bound of the 2-adic valuation of the algebraic central $L$-value $L(f, \chi_M, 1)$ and evaluate the 2-adic valuation for an infinite number of $M$.</description>

      <title>On the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of a totally $p$-adic imaginary quadratic field -- With an appendix by Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Jaulent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16603v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt {-m})$ and $p &gt; 2$ split in $k$. We prove new properties of the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions $K/k$, distinct from the cyclotomic; we do not assume $K/k$ totally ramified, nor the triviality of the $p$-class group of $k$. These properties are governed by the $p$-valuation, $\delta_p(k)$, of a suitable Fermat quotient of the fundamental $p$-unit $x$ of $k$, which also yields the order of the logarithmic class group (2.2, App. A), and generalize the Gold-Sands criterion (5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5). These results use the second element $(\mathcal{H}_{K_n}/\mathcal{H}_{K_n}^{G_n})^{G_n}$ of the filtration of the $p$-class groups in $K=\cup_n K_n$, without any argument of Iwasawa's theory, and provide new perspectives. We compute, Sec. 7, the first layer $K_1$, using the Log-function, then give a short proof of a result of Kundu-Washington (5.6), and show (7.4, 7.6) that capitulation is possible in $K$, suggesting Conjecture 5.8. Calculations are gathered App. B.</description>

      <title>Lattices in rigid analytic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a profinite group $G$ and a rigid analytic space $X$, we study when an $\mathcal O_X(X)$-linear representation $V$ of $G$ admits a lattice, i.e. an $\mathcal O_{\mathcal X}(\mathcal X)$-linear model for a suitable formal model $\mathcal X$ of $X$ in the sense of Berthelot. We give a positive answer, under mild assumptions, when $X$ is a ``wide open'' space. As a consequence, we are able to describe explicit open rational subdomains of $X$ over which $V$ is constant after reduction modulo a power of $p$. We give applications in two different directions. First, we prove explicit results on the reduction modulo powers of $p$ of sheaves of crystalline and semistable representations of fixed weight. Second, we focus on the sheaves of Galois representations on eigenvarieties, which are important examples of wide open spaces thanks to a result of Bella\"iche and Chenevier. We give an application of our main results to the pseudorepresentation carried by the Coleman--Mazur eigencurve, which can be made explicit whenever equations for a rational subdomain of the eigencurve are given.</description>

Abstract: We give a simple matrix-based proof of congruence equations modulo a prime $p$ involving sums of binomial coefficients appearing in Pascal's triangle. These equations can be used to construct some groups of exponent $p^n$. These groups, as well as others of exponent $p^{n+1}$, explain why $p=2$ is not really an exceptional prime in relation to the Heisenberg group over the field with $p$ elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let's fix a complex abelian scheme endowed with a non-torsion section and with a finite surjective modular map onto a universal family of abelian varieties (with some fixed level-$\ell$-structure and without locally constant parts). We show that the relative monodromy group of the abelian logarithm is non-trivial and of full rank. As a consequence we deduce a new proof of Manin's kernel theorem and of the algebraic independence of the coordinates of abelian logarithms with respect to the coordinates of periods.</description>

      <title>Automorphism Groups of Finite Extensions of Fields and the Minimal Ramification Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the following question: given a global field $F$ and finite group $G$, what is the minimal $r$ such that there exists a finite extension $K/F$ with $\mathrm{Aut}(K/F)\cong G$ that is ramified over exactly $r$ places of $F$? We conjecture that the answer is $\le 1$ for any global field $F$ and finite group $G$. In the case when $F$ is a number field we show that the answer is always $\le 4[F:\mathbb Q]$. We show that assuming Schinzel's Hypothesis H the answer is always $\le 1$ if $F$ is a number field. We show unconditionally that the answer is always $\le 1$ if $F$ is a global function field.
  We also show that for a broader class of fields $F$ than previously known, every finite group $G$ can be realized as the automorphism group of a finite extension $K/F$ (without restriction on the ramification).
  An important new tool used in this work is a recent result of the author and C. Tsang, which says that for any finite group $G$ there exists a natural number $n$ and a subgroup $H\leqslant S_n$ of the symmetric group such that $N_{S_n}(H)/H\cong G$.</description>

      <title>Topographs for binary quadratic forms and class numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study, in greater detail than before, J.H. Conway's topographs for integral binary quadratic forms. These are trees in the plane with regions labeled by integers following a simple pattern. Each topograph can display the values of a single form, or represent an equivalence class of forms. We give a new treatment of reduction of forms to canonical equivalence class representatives by employing topographs and a novel continued fraction for complex numbers. This allows uniform reduction for any positive, negative, square or non-square discriminant. Topograph geometry also provides new class number formulas, and short proofs of results of Gauss relating to sums of three squares. Generalizations of the series of Hurwitz for class numbers give evaluations of certain infinite series, summed over the regions or edges of a topograph.</description>

      <title>Small solutions of generic ternary quadratic congruences to general moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study small non-trivial solutions of quadratic congruences of the form $x_1^2+\alpha_2x_2^2+\alpha_3x_3^2\equiv 0 \bmod{q}$, with $q$ being an odd natural number, in an average sense. This extends previous work of the authors in which they considered the case of prime power moduli $q$. Above, $\alpha_2$ is arbitrary but fixed and $\alpha_3$ is variable, and we assume that $(\alpha_2\alpha_3,q)=1$. We show that for all $\alpha_3$ modulo $q$ which are coprime to $q$ except for a small number of $\alpha_3$'s, an asymptotic formula for the number of solutions $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ to the congruence $x_1^2+\alpha_2x_2^2+\alpha_3x_3^2\equiv 0 \bmod{q}$ with $\max\{|x_1|,|x_2|,|x_3|\}\le N$ and $(x_3,q)=1$ holds if $N\ge q^{11/24+\varepsilon}$ and $q$ is large enough. It is of significance that we break the barrier 1/2 in the above exponent. Key tools in our work are Burgess's estimate for character sums over short intervals and Heath-Brown's estimate for character sums with binary quadratic forms over small regions whose proofs depend on the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields. We also formulate a refined conjecture about the size of the smallest solution of a ternary quadratic congruence, using information about the Diophantine properties of its coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.01890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I coined the term anabelomorphy (pronounced as anabel-o-morphy) as a concise way of expressing Mochizuki's idea of "anabelian way of changing ground field, rings etc." which was he has introduced in his work on his Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of this idea by studying its ramifications in the more familiar arithmetic contexts such as the theory of Galois representations, automorphic forms and related areas and establish a number of results which are of independent arithmetic interest. I also introduce the notion of anabelomorphically connected number fields in which two number fields are related by the existence of topological isomorphism between the local Galois groups at a finite list of primes of both the number fields and prove some results illustrating arithmetic consequences of this notion. The Introduction provides a detailed discussion and summary of all the results proved in this paper.</description>

      <title>The local converse theorem for odd special orthogonal and symplectic groups in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic different from $2$ and $G$ be either an odd special orthogonal group ${\rm SO}_{2r+1}(F)$ or a symplectic group ${\rm Sp}_{2r}(F)$. In this paper, we establish the local converse theorem for $G$. Namely, for given two irreducible admissible generic representations of $G$ with the same central character, if they have the same local gamma factors twisted by irreducible supercuspidal representations of ${\rm GL}_n(F)$ for all $1 \leq n \leq r$ with the same additive character, these representations are isomorphic. Using the theory of Cogdell, Shahidi, and Tsai on partial Bessel functions and the classification of irreducible generic representations, we break the barrier on the rank of twists $1 \leq n \leq 2r-1$ in the work of Jiang and Soudry, and extend the result of Q. Zhang, which was achieved for all supercuspidal representations in characteristic $0$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa's conjecture that the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are radial limits of homological blocks, which are $ q $-series introduced by them for plumbed $ 3 $-manifolds with negative definite linking matrices. In our previous work, the author attributed this conjecture to the holomorphy of certain rational functions by developing an asymptotic formula based on the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula. However, it is challenging to prove holomorphy for general plumbed manifolds. In this paper, we address this challenge using induction on a sequence of trees obtained by repeating "pruning trees."</description>

      <title>Are prime numbers and quadratic residues random?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Appeals to randomness in various number-theoretic constructions appear regularly in modern scientific publications. Such famous names as V.I. Arnold, M. Katz, Yu.G. Sinai, and T. Tao are just a few examples. Unfortunately, all of these approaches rely on various, although often very non-trivial and elegant, heuristics. A new analytical approach is proposed to address the issue of randomness/complexity of an individual deterministic sequence. This approach demonstrates the expected high complexity of quadratic residues and the unexpectedly low complexity in the case of prime numbers. Technically, our approach is based on a new construction of the entropy of a single trajectory of a dynamical system, which occupies an intermediate position between the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Dieudonn\'e theory via cohomology classifying stacks II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply stack theoretic ideas to the classification problem in Dieudonn\'e theory. First, we use crystalline cohomology of classifying stacks to directly reconstruct the classical Dieudonn\'e module of a finite, $p$-power rank, commutative group scheme $G$ over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. As a consequence, we give a new, much shorter proof of the isomorphism $\sigma^* M(G) \simeq \mathrm{Ext}^1 (G, \mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{crys}})$ due to Berthelot--Breen--Messing using stacky methods combined with the theory of de Rham--Witt complexes. Additionally, we show that finite locally free commutative group schemes of $p$-power rank over a quasisyntomic base can be classified in terms of ``prismatic Dieudonn\'e $F$-gauges", which we introduce by making constructions using (higher) classifying stacks. The latter generalizes the result of Ansch\"utz and Le Bras on classification of $p$-divisible groups, which we also reprove using our approach. Along the way, we prove a description of cohomology with coefficients in group schemes, compatibility with Cartier duality, and reconstruction of Galois representations in terms of our prismatic Dieudonn\'e $F$-gauges.</description>

      <title>Quantitative concatenation for polynomial box norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using PET and quantitative concatenation techniques, we establish box-norm control with the "expected" directions for counting operators for general multidimensional polynomial progressions, with at most polynomial losses in the parameters. Such results are often useful first steps towards obtaining explicit upper bounds on sets lacking instances of given such progressions. In the companion paper arXiv:2407.08637, we complete this program for sets in $[N]^2$ lacking nondegenerate progressions of the form $(x, y), (x + P(z), y), (x, y + P(z))$, where $P \in \mathbb{Z}[z]$ is any fixed polynomial with an integer root of multiplicity $1$.</description>

      <title>Corners with polynomial side length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $P$-polynomial corner, for $P \in \mathbb{Z}[z]$ a polynomial, is a triple of points $(x,y),\; (x+P(z),y),\; (x,y+P(z))$ for $x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z}$. In the case where $P$ has an integer root of multiplicity $1$, we show that if $A \subseteq [N]^2$ does not contain any nontrivial $P$-polynomial corners, then $$|A| \ll_P \frac{N^2}{(\log\log\log N)^c}$$ for some absolute constant $c&gt;0$. This simultaneously generalizes a result of Shkredov about corner-free sets and a recent result of Peluse, Sah, and Sawhney about sets without $3$-term arithmetic progressions of common difference $z^2-1$. The main ingredients in our proof are a multidimensional quantitative concatenation result from our companion paper arXiv:2407.08636 and a novel degree-lowering argument for box norms.</description>

      <title>Operational Umbral Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of almost purely operational methods in the study of umbral calculus. To accomplish this goal, we systematically reconstruct the theory operationally, offering new proofs and results throughout. Our approach is applied to the study of invertible power series, where we notably offer a concise two-line proof of Lagrange's inversion theorem, derive formulas for both fractional and regular compositional iterates and generalize Jabotinsky matrices. In addition, we will develop several new insights into umbral operators, including their fractional exponents and novel expressions, in connection with the previously discussed applications. Finally, we will elaborate on both established and new concepts and examples, such as pseudoinverses of delta operators and a natural generalization of the Laguerre polynomials.</description>
