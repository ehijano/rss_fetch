      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of U.S. Ideological Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of political opinion are a critical component of modern society with large-scale implications for the evolution of intra- and international political discourse and policy. Here we utilize recent high-resolution survey data to quantitatively capture leading-order psychological and information-environmental patterns. We then inform simulations of a theoretical dynamical framework with several different models for how populations' ideology evolves over time, including a model which reproduces current macro-scale ideological distributions given the empirical micro-scale data gathered. This effort represents an attempt to discover true underlying trends of political reasoning in general audiences, and to extrapolate the long-term implications of those trends as they interact with the political exposure landscape. Accurate modeling of this ecosystem has the potential to predict catastrophic outcomes such as hyperpolarization, and to inform effective intervention strategies aimed at preserving and rebuilding constructive political communication.</description>

      <title>Latent Class Logit Kernel Framework for Surrogate Safety: Identifying Behavioural Thresholds through Conflict Indicator Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crash data objectively characterize road safety but are rare and often unsuitable for proactive safety management. Traffic conflict indicators such as time-to-collision (TTC) provide continuous measures of collision proximity but require thresholds to distinguish routine from safety-critical interactions. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) offers statistically defined thresholds, yet these do not necessarily represent how drivers perceive and respond to conflict. This study introduces a behavioural modelling framework that identifies candidate behavioural thresholds (CBTs) by explicitly modelling how drivers adjust their movements under conflict conditions. The framework is based on a Latent Class Logit Kernel (LC-LK) model that captures inter-class heterogeneity (routine vs. defensive driving) and intra-class correlation between overlapping spatial alternatives. This yields probability curves showing how the likelihood of defensive manoeuvres varies with conflict indicators, from which CBTs such as inflection points and crossovers can be extracted. The framework tests four hypotheses: (1) drivers exhibit varying degrees of membership in both low- and high-risk classes; (2) membership shifts systematically with conflict values, revealing behavioural thresholds; (3) this relationship follows a logistic shape, with stable behaviour at safe levels and rapid transitions near critical points; and (4) even in free flow, drivers maintain a baseline caution level. Application to naturalistic roundabout trajectories revealed stable TTC thresholds (0.8-1.1 s) but unstable MTTC2 estimates (e.g., 34 s), suggesting cognitive limits in processing complex indicators. Overall, the framework complements EVT by offering a structured, behaviourally grounded method for identifying and validating thresholds in surrogate safety analysis.</description>

      <title>Do Railway Commuters Exhibit Consistent Route Choice Rationality Across Different Contexts and Time? Evidence from Tokyo metropolitan Commutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in data collection and technology enable a deeper understanding of complex urban commuting, yet few studies have rigorously analyzed the temporal stability and Origin-Destination (OD) heterogeneity of route choice. To address this, we analyze one year of smartphone position data from over one million users in the Tokyo metropolitan area to extract high-resolution commuting trajectories. Our methodology is twofold: First, we develop algorithms to process raw position data, accurately extracting the commuting trajectory, transportation mode, and transfer stations. Second, by reinterpreting the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model through the canonical ensemble framework of statistical physics, we model route choice rationality as a temperature-dependent system. Our approach uniquely measures behavioral consistency in terms of rationality and preference stability over time, and distinguishes systematic from random heterogeneity. Our results reveal temporal stability in aggregate route choice behavior across the entire urban region throughout 2023. Also, we found heterogeneity dependent on the origin and destination (OD) pair. This variation is reflected as a bimodal split in the estimated route parameters, indicating that for certain attributes, commuters fall into two distinct groups with contrasting preference signs. We believe that our findings serve a basis for future urban route choice modeling by suggesting the importance of elabolating the model of transfer in railway.</description>

      <title>Large cities lose their growth edge as urban systems mature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From 1975 to 2025, urban populations have become increasingly concentrated in large cities. On average across countries, the share of urban residents living in cities with over one million people rose from 18\% in 1975 to 39\% in 2025. Will this trend towards greater concentration in large cities continue or level off? We introduce two new city population datasets that use consistent city definitions across countries and over time. The first covers the world between 1975 and 2025, using satellite imagery. The second covers the U.S. between 1850 and 2020, using census microdata. We find that urban growth follows a consistent life cycle. Early in urbanization, large cities grow faster than smaller ones. As urban systems mature, this growth advantage fades, and cities of all sizes grow at similar rates. We use this life cycle to project future concentration in large cities. Our projections suggest that over the next 50 years, concentration will increase at less than half the rate observed in the past 50 years.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemics on Multiplex Networks: Epidemic Threshold and Basic Reproduction Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate epidemic forecasting requires models that account for the layered and heterogeneous nature of real social interactions. The basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$ calculated from models that assume homogeneous mixing or single-layer contact structures have limited applicability to complex social systems. Here, we propose an expression of $\mathcal R_0$ in the context of multiplex networks, enabling the analysis of disease transmission across multiple social layers.
  We adapt the Degree-Based Mean-Field (DBMF) SIR model for single-layered complex networks to the multiplex setting, where each layer has its own degree distribution and infection rate. Using the Next Generation Matrix method, we derive an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$. Numerical integration of the multiplex DBMF equations shows that $\mathcal R_0 = 1$ marks the epidemic threshold and governs the functional dependence of key outbreak indicators. In addition to the exact result for the $\mathcal R_0$, we provide an approximation denoted as $\tau$, which is easier to compute and more straightforward to interpret in terms of the parameters of the system, and shares most of the expected properties of the basic reproduction number.
  Stochastic agent-based simulations confirm these results, demonstrating a direct correspondence between $\tau$ and the average number of secondary infections in the early epidemic phase, in line with the interpretation of $\mathcal R_0$.
  This research provides a robust generalization of $\mathcal R_0$ for layered contact structures, offering a more realistic basis for epidemic forecasting and the design of intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Physics perspective on fairness in shared expenses: The bar bill analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In social contexts where individuals consume varying amounts, such as shared meals or bar gatherings, splitting the total bill equally often yields surprisingly fair outcomes. In this work, we develop a statistical physics framework to explain this emergent fairness by modeling individual consumption as stochastic variables drawn from a realistic distribution, specifically the gamma distribution. Introducing a Boltzmann-like weighting factor, we derive exact analytical expressions for the partition function, average consumption, variance, and entropy under economic or social penalization constraints. Numerical simulations, performed using the Marsaglia-Tsang algorithm, confirm the analytical results with high precision. Drawing a direct parallel between individual consumption and ideal gas particle energy in the canonical ensemble, we show how the law of large numbers, mutual compensation, and the effective ordering induced by penalization combine to make equal cost-sharing statistically robust and predictable. These findings reveal that what appears to be an informal social convention is, in fact, grounded in the same fundamental principles that govern the collective behavior of particles in thermodynamic systems, highlighting the interdisciplinary power of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Are EU low-carbon structural funds efficient in reducing emissions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of low-carbon expenditures from the European Structural and Investment Funds in reducing greenhouse gas emissions across EU regions. Using trend and cycle decomposition of per capita emissions and emissions intensity, along with a panel data approach that incorporates long lags to mitigate reverse causality, we find highly heterogeneous effects. In less developed regions, investments are associated with long-term increases in per capita emissions, whereas in transition and developed regions, the effects are weak or not significant. When disaggregated by gas type, results remain inconsistent. Our findings highlight that regional disparities challenge the effectiveness of EU climate efforts.</description>
