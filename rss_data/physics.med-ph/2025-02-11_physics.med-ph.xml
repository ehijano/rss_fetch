      <title>A self-contact electromechanical framework for intestinal motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an advanced multiphysics and multiscale modeling approach to investigate intestinal motility. We propose a generalized electromechanical framework that incorporates contact mechanics, enabling the development of a unique and innovative model for intestinal motility. The theoretical framework includes an electromechanical model coupling a microstructural material model, which describes the intestinal structure, with an electrophysiological model that captures the propagation of slow waves. Additionally, it integrates a self-contact detection algorithm based on a nearest-neighbour search and the penalty method, along with boundary conditions that account for the influence of surrounding organs. A staggered finite element scheme implemented in FEniCS is employed to solve the governing equations using the finite element method. The model is applied to study cases of moderate and severe strangulation hernia, as well as intestinal adhesion syndrome. The results demonstrate that low peristalsis takes place in the pre-strangulation zone. At the same time, very high pressure is recorded in the strangulation zone, and peristaltic contractions persisted in the healthy region. For adhesions, the results indicate a complete absence of peristalsis in the adherent region. The model successfully reproduces both qualitatively and quantitatively propagative contractions in complex scenarios, such as pre- and post-surgical conditions, thereby highlighting its potential to provide valuable insights for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>A coupled planar transmit RF array for ultrahigh field spine MR imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-field MRI, such as those operating at 7 Tesla, enhances diagnostic capabilities but also presents unique challenges, including the need for advanced RF coil designs to achieve an optimal signal-to-noise ratio and transmit efficiency, particularly when imaging large samples. In this work, we introduce the coupled planar array, a novel technique for high-frequency, large-size RF coil design with enhanced the RF magnetic field (B1) efficiency and transmit performance for ultrahigh-field spine imaging applications. This array comprises multiple resonators that are electromagnetically coupled to function as a single multimodal resonator. The field distribution of its highest frequency mode is suitable for spine imaging applications. Based on the numerical modeling and calculation, a prototype of the coupled planar array was constructed and its performance was evaluated through comprehensive numerical simulations, rigorous RF measurements, empirical tests, and a comparison against a conventional surface coil with the same size and geometry. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed coupled planar array exhibits superior performance compared to conventional surface coils in terms of B1 efficiency for both transmit (B1+) and receive (B1-) fields, specific absorption rate (SAR), and the ability to operate at high frequencies. This study suggests a promising and efficient approach to the design of high-frequency, large-size RF coils for spine MR imaging at ultrahigh magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A CT Geometry With Multiple Centers Of Rotation For Solving Sparse View Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of CNT (Carbon nanotube), static and instant CT scanning becomes possible. By transforming the traditionally rotated thermal source into a static ring array source composed of multiple CNTs, the imaging system can achieve high temporal resolution in scanning. However, due to the non-negligible packaging size of CNTs, the static CT based on CNTs faces sparse view problem, which affects the image quality by introducing streak artifacts. In this study, we based on the local correlation equation (LCE) to address the sparse view problem of static CT. The LCE is a series of partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the local correlation of Radon transform in a neighborhood projection domain. Based on LCE, we analyze the characteristic of sparse view projection and propose a scanning geometry with multiple rotation centers, which is different from existing CT devices that acquires the projection around one rotation center. Specifically, in the proposed scanning geometry, the circular ring array X-ray sources is divided into several arcs while the sources of each arc share one rotation center. All rotation centers of the arcs are uniformly distributed on a small circle. The optimal distribution of the rotation centers can be optimized by the radius of the circle. Moreover, to elevate the image quality under the sparse view reconstruction, we employed the LCE to interpolate unmeasured projections. Compared to the single rotation center scheme used in existing CT geometries, the multiple rotation centers scan contributes to a more even projection distribution with same view number. The simulated results demonstrated the efficiency and potential applications of the proposed method in static CT reconstructions.</description>

      <title>High-Intensity Helical Flow: A Double-Edged Sword in Coronary Artery Haemodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of Helical Flow (HF) in human coronary arteries remains uncertain, yet its understanding promises unprecedented insights into atherosclerotic processes. In this study, we investigated the effects of HF and key haemodynamic descriptors in 39 patient-specific left coronary artery trees from the ASOCA dataset, including 20 non-stenosed and 19 stenosed cases. Absolute HF intensity $h_2$ correlated with higher Time-Averaged Endothelial Shear Stress (TAESS) in all vessel segments regardless of stenosis (p &lt; 0.05). In stenosed cases, this correlation was so prominent that the vessel area exposed to adversely low TAESS was reduced (&lt; 0.5 Pa, p = 0.0001), while areas of adversely high TAESS increased (&gt; 4.71 Pa, p &lt; 0.05), coinciding with high $h_2$ regions. This suggests that HF in coronary arteries is not always protective as previously thought. It not only mitigates low TAESS, which is associated with long-term plaque development and restenosis, but also exacerbates adversely high TAESS, which is linked to increased plaque vulnerability and acute events. Our findings redefine the current understanding of helical blood flow's role in cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease processes.</description>

      <title>Neurophysiological correlates to the human brain complexity through $q$-statistical analysis of electroencephalogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prospects of assessing neural complexity (NC) by $q$-statistics of the systemic organization of different types and levels of brain activity were studied. In 70 adult subjects, NC was assessed via the parameter $q$ of $q$-statistics, applied to the ongoing and EEG and its spectral power of 20 scalp points (channels). The NC were estimated both globally for all channels (AllCh) and locally (for each single channel) in different Functional States (FSs). The values of $q$ was compared among FSs and single channels, as well they were correlated with the power of $\theta$ (4-8Hz), $\beta_1$ (15-25Hz) and others EEG bands, in each FS. The value of $q$ across all FSs was higher for AllCh than for the single channels FSs. Consistently with previous studies, we found a negative correlation between NC and age. The FSs did not influence the $q$ of the EEG in AllCh, although locally the FS modulated $q$ in a consistent manner (e.g., reducing $q$ in posterior sites with eyes closed). The $q$ was correlated positively with the power of the $\theta$ and negatively with that of the $\beta_1$ band in general. These findings support the idea that, as a first approach, $q$-statistics can describe the human NC. The relationship between $q$ and $\theta$ power aligns with greater NC during FSs such as listening music and resting with eyes open, which is consistent with high-order representations rather than low-informative attentional tasks (OddBall).</description>

      <title>3D Single-shot CEST imaging at 3T Based on True FISP Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To simultaneously fit multiple-pool effects, spectrally selective 3D CEST imaging typically requires single-shot readouts to save time. However, to date, FLASH and EPI have been the primary pulse sequences used for this purpose. They suffer from low SNR or image distortion related to B0 field inhomogeneity. In this work, we developed a 3D single-shot CEST sequence using true fast imaging with steady-state precession (True FISP) readout, also known as bSSFP, and optimized the scanning parameters through simulations. The performance of the CEST sequence was validated using an egg white phantom, ten healthy volunteers, and a patient with a brain tumor on a 3T human scanner. Subsequently, the proposed CEST sequence using True FISP was compared with the commonly used FLASH-based CEST sequence, focusing on SNR and image contrast, while maintaining identical pre-saturation modes, repetition time, echo time and scan time. In the simulation experiments, the maximum CEST signal obtained from the True FISP was significantly greater than that obtained from the FLASH sequence. In the egg white phantom, the SNRs of amide proton transfer (APT) and nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) effect images obtained from the True FISP were 68.3% and 57.0% higher than those obtained from the FLASH sequence, respectively. In healthy volunteers, saturated images collected with the True FISP sequence at 3.5 ppm showed an approximate 84% increase in mean temporal SNR compared to those collected with the FLASH sequence. Compared to the FLASH sequence, the CEST images obtained from the True FISP sequence could display more detailed brain tissue structures of both normal individuals and the patient with a brain tumor. Therefore, due to the high SNR inherent in the sequence, True FISP has the potential to be used for fast and high-quality 3D image readout of CEST contrasts in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer for General Accelerated Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the development of generalizable models that achieve state-of-the-art performance across various imaging tasks. Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures, in particular, have demonstrated strong feature extraction capabilities when pre-trained on large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce the Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer (MR-IPT), a ViT-based framework designed to enhance the generalizability and robustness of accelerated MRI reconstruction. Unlike conventional deep learning models that require separate training for different acceleration factors, MR-IPT is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset encompassing multiple undersampling patterns and acceleration settings, enabling a unified reconstruction framework. By leveraging a shared transformer backbone, MR-IPT effectively learns universal feature representations, allowing it to generalize across diverse reconstruction tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR-IPT outperforms both CNN-based and existing transformer-based methods, achieving superior reconstruction quality across varying acceleration factors and sampling masks. Moreover, MR-IPT exhibits strong robustness, maintaining high performance even under unseen acquisition setups, highlighting its potential as a scalable and efficient solution for accelerated MRI. Our findings suggest that transformer-based general models can significantly advance MRI reconstruction, offering improved adaptability and stability compared to traditional deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Decoding Gray Matter: large-scale analysis of brain cell morphometry to inform microstructural modeling of diffusion MR signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of grey matter has long been a key focus in neuroscience, as cell morphology varies by type and can be affected by neurological conditions. Understanding these variations is essential for studying brain function and disease. Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a powerful non-invasive tool for examining cellular microstructure in vivo. However, for dMRI to accurately reflect cellular features, it is crucial to determine which aspects of morphology influence its measurements. Proper interpretation of dMRI data depends on understanding its sensitivity to different cellular characteristics.
  Despite growing interest in cellular morphology, there has been no systematic report on the key features defining different neural cell types. To address this, we analyzed over 3,500 three-dimensional cellular reconstructions across three species and nine cell types, establishing reference values for critical morphological traits. These traits fall into three categories: structural features that define the cell's skeletal framework, shape features that describe spatial organization, and topological features that break down cellular structure to distinguish cell types. Beyond reporting these reference values, we examine their relevance for dMRI, identifying which neural features dMRI can detect and which cell types may be distinguishable.
  This work provides essential benchmarks for grey matter research, offering new guidelines on linking neuroimaging measurements to neurobiology. These reference values will be a valuable resource for neuroscientists and neuroimaging researchers, aiding in the interpretation of imaging data and the refinement of brain tissue models.</description>
