      <title>Explaining Risks: Axiomatic Risk Attributions for Financial Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning models have achieved great success at the expense of highly complex black-box structures. By using axiomatic attribution methods, we can fairly allocate the contributions of each feature, thus allowing us to interpret the model predictions. In high-risk sectors such as finance, risk is just as important as mean predictions. Throughout this work, we address the following risk attribution problem: how to fairly allocate the risk given a model with data? We demonstrate with analysis and empirical examples that risk can be well allocated by extending the Shapley value framework.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Strategies: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Robust Financial Optimization through Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of model uncertainty in quantitative finance, where decisions in portfolio allocation, derivative pricing, and risk management rely on estimating stochastic models from limited data. In practice, the unavailability of the true probability measure forces reliance on an empirical approximation, and even small misestimations can lead to significant deviations in decision quality. Building on the framework of Klibanoff et al. (2005), we enhance the conventional objective - whether this is expected utility in an investing context or a hedging metric - by superimposing an outer "uncertainty measure", motivated by traditional monetary risk measures, on the space of models. In scenarios where a natural model distribution is lacking or Bayesian methods are impractical, we propose an ad hoc subsampling strategy, analogous to bootstrapping in statistical finance and related to mini-batch sampling in deep learning, to approximate model uncertainty. To address the quadratic memory demands of naive implementations, we also present an adapted stochastic gradient descent algorithm that enables efficient parallelization. Through analytical, simulated, and empirical studies - including multi-period, real data and high-dimensional examples - we demonstrate that uncertainty measures outperform traditional mixture of measures strategies and our model-agnostic subsampling-based approach not only enhances robustness against model risk but also achieves performance comparable to more elaborate Bayesian methods.</description>

      <title>A Sinusoidal Hull-White Model for Interest Rate Dynamics: Capturing Long-Term Periodicity in U.S. Treasury Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is motivated by empirical observations of periodic fluctuations in interest rates, notably long-term economic cycles spanning decades, which the conventional Hull-White short-rate model fails to adequately capture. To address this limitation, we propose an extension that incorporates a sinusoidal, time-varying mean reversion speed, allowing the model to reflect cyclic interest rate dynamics more effectively.
  The model is calibrated using a comprehensive dataset of daily U.S. Treasury yield curves obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database, covering the period from January 1990 to December 2022. The dataset includes tenors of 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years, with the most recent yields ranging from 1.22% (1-year) to 2.36% (30-year).
  Calibration is performed using the Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm, and Monte Carlo simulations with 200 paths and a time step of 0.05 years. The resulting 30-year zero-coupon bond price under the proposed model is 0.43, compared to 0.47 under the standard Hull-White model. This corresponds to root mean squared errors of 0.12% and 0.14%, respectively, indicating a noticeable improvement in fit, particularly for longer maturities.
  These results highlight the model's enhanced capability to capture long-term yield dynamics and suggest significant implications for bond pricing, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of interest rate derivatives. The findings also open avenues for further research into stochastic periodicity and alternative interest rate modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>From Axioms to Algorithms: Mechanized Proofs of the vNM Utility Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive formalization of the von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) expected utility theorem using the Lean 4 interactive theorem prover. We implement the classical axioms of preference-completeness, transitivity, continuity, and independence-enabling machine-verified proofs of both the existence and uniqueness of utility representations. Our formalization captures the mathematical structure of preference relations over lotteries, verifying that preferences satisfying the vNM axioms can be represented by expected utility maximization.
  Our contributions include a granular implementation of the independence axiom, formally verified proofs of fundamental claims about mixture lotteries, constructive demonstrations of utility existence, and computational experiments validating the results. We prove equivalence to classical presentations while offering greater precision at decision boundaries.
  This formalization provides a rigorous foundation for applications in economic modeling, AI alignment, and management decision systems, bridging the gap between theoretical decision theory and computational implementation.</description>

      <title>Open-FinLLMs: Open Multimodal Large Language Models for Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial LLMs hold promise for advancing financial tasks and domain-specific applications. However, they are limited by scarce corpora, weak multimodal capabilities, and narrow evaluations, making them less suited for real-world application. To address this, we introduce \textit{Open-FinLLMs}, the first open-source multimodal financial LLMs designed to handle diverse tasks across text, tabular, time-series, and chart data, excelling in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. The suite includes FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a comprehensive 52-billion-token corpus; FinLLaMA-Instruct, fine-tuned with 573K financial instructions; and FinLLaVA, enhanced with 1.43M multimodal tuning pairs for strong cross-modal reasoning. We comprehensively evaluate Open-FinLLMs across 14 financial tasks, 30 datasets, and 4 multimodal tasks in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning settings, introducing two new multimodal evaluation datasets. Our results show that Open-FinLLMs outperforms afvanced financial and general LLMs such as GPT-4, across financial NLP, decision-making, and multi-modal tasks, highlighting their potential to tackle real-world challenges. To foster innovation and collaboration across academia and industry, we release all codes (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIXIU2-0D70/B1D7/LICENSE) and models under OSI-approved licenses.</description>
