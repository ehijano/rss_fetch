      <title>Hyperbolicity, topology, and combinatorics of fine curve graphs and variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a surface, the fine $k$-curve graph of the surface is a graph whose vertices are simple closed essential curves and whose edges connect curves that intersect in at most $k$ points. We note that the fine $k$-curve graph is hyperbolic for all $k$ and, for $k\geq 2,$ show that it contains as induced subgraphs all countable graphs. We also show that the direct limit of this family of graphs, which we call the finitary curve graph, has diameter 2, has a contractible flag complex, contains every countable graph as an induced subgraph, and has as its automorphism group the homeomorphism group of the surface. Finally, we explore some finite graphs that are not induced subgraphs of fine curve graphs.</description>

      <title>Small Triangulations of Simply Connected 4-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present small triangulations of all connected sums of $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and $S^2 \times S^2$ with the standard piecewise linear structure. Our triangulations have $2\beta_2+2$ pentachora, where $\beta_2$ is the second Betti number of the manifold. By a conjecture of the authors and, independently, Burke, these triangulations have the smallest possible number of pentachora for their respective topological types.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Handlebody Complements in 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M_0$ be a compact and orientable 3-manifold. After capping off spherical boundaries with balls and removing any torus boundaries, we prove that the resulting manifold $M$ contains handlebodies of arbitrary genus such that the closure of their complement is hyperbolic. We then extend the octahedral decomposition to obtain bounds on volume for some of these handlebody complements.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

Abstract: We show that the complement of arithmetic modular links found in arXiv:2307.09409 is homeomorphic to the complement of augmented chainlinks. In particular, these link complements arise as n-fold cyclic covers of the Whitehead link complement.</description>

      <title>Large-$n$ asymptotics for Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry and spectral theory of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with genus-$g$ and $n$ cusps in the large-$n$ limit. We show that for a random hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ with $n$ large, the number of small Laplacian eigenvalues is linear in $n$ with high probability. By work of Otal and Rosas [41], this result is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We also study the relative frequency of simple and non-simple closed geodesics, showing that on random surfaces with many cusps, most closed geodesics with lengths up to $\log(n)$ scales are non-simple. Our main technical contribution is a novel large-$n$ asymptotic formula for the Weil-Petersson volume $V_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of genus-$g$ hyperbolic surfaces with $k$ geodesic boundary components and $n-k$ cusps with $k$ fixed, building on work of Manin and Zograf [30].</description>

      <title>A smooth Birman-Hilden theory for hyperk\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article grew out of an effort to understand the smooth mapping class groups of certain 4-manifolds in a geometric manner. We prove a smooth analog of the Birman-Hilden theorem for manifolds that admit a hyperk\"ahler structure. This allows us to probe the smooth mapping class groups associated to certain manifolds with nontrivial fundamental groups. Along the way, and of independent interest, we prove a global Torelli theorem for generalized Enriques manifolds. The techniques used are analogous to Teichm\"uller-theoretic methods in the classical theory of mapping class groups. We apply this hyperk\"ahler Birman-Hilden theorem to obtain results regarding smooth, metric, and complex Nielsen realization on Enriques surfaces.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-Betti numbers of Dehn fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the $L^2$-Betti numbers of group-theoretic Dehn fillings. For a broad class of virtually special groups $G$, we prove that the $L^2$-Betti numbers of sufficiently deep Dehn fillings $\overline{G}$ are equal to those of $G$. As applications, we verify the Singer Conjecture for certain Einstein manifolds, establish a virtual fibering criterion for $\overline{G}$, obtain bounds on deficiency of $\overline{G}$, and provide new examples of hyperbolic groups with exotic subgroups that arise as Dehn fillings of any cusped arithmetic hyperbolic manifold of dimension at least four.</description>
