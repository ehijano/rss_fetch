      <title>DRACO: Data Replication and Collection Framework for Enhanced Data Availability and Robustness in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds, enabling seamless interaction with real-world objects via the Internet. However, IoT systems face significant challenges in ensuring efficient data generation, collection, and management, particularly due to the resource-constrained and unreliable nature of connected devices, which can lead to data loss. This paper presents DRACO (Data Replication and Collection), a framework that integrates a distributed hop-by-hop data replication approach with an overhead-free mobile sink-based data collection strategy. DRACO enhances data availability, optimizes replica placement, and ensures efficient data retrieval even under node failures and varying network densities. Extensive ns-3 simulations demonstrate that DRACO outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, improving data availability by up to 15% and 34%, and replica creation by up to 18% and 40%, compared to greedy and random replication techniques, respectively. DRACO also ensures efficient data dissemination through optimized replica distribution and achieves superior data collection efficiency under varying node densities and failure scenarios as compared to commonly used uncontrolled sink mobility approaches namely random walk and self-avoiding random walk. By addressing key IoT data management challenges, DRACO offers a scalable and resilient solution well-suited for emerging use cases.</description>

      <title>TDoA-Based Self-Supervised Channel Charting with NLoS Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel Charting (CC) has emerged as a promising framework for data-driven radio localization, yet existing approaches often struggle to scale globally and to handle the distortions introduced by non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. In this work, we propose a novel CC method that leverages Channel Impulse Response (CIR) data enriched with practical features such as Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Transmission Reception Point (TRP) locations, enabling a self-supervised localization function on a global scale. The proposed framework is further enhanced with short-interval User Equipment (UE) displacement measurements, which improve the continuity and robustness of the learned positioning function. Our algorithm incorporates a mechanism to identify and mask NLoS-induced noisy measurements, leading to significant performance gains. We present the evaluations of our proposed models in a real 5G testbed and benchmarked against centimeter-accurate Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning, in an O-RAN--based 5G network by OpenAirInterface (OAI) software at EURECOM. It demonstrated outperforming results against the state-of-the-art semi-supervised and self-supervised CC approaches in a real-world scenario. The results show localization accuracies of 2-4 meters in 90% of cases, across a range of NLoS ratios. Furthermore, we provide public datasets of CIR recordings, along with the true position labels used in this paper's evaluation.</description>

      <title>When Light Bends to the Collective Will: A Theory and Vision for Adaptive Photonic Scale-up Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As chip-to-chip silicon photonics gain traction for their bandwidth and energy efficiency, collective communication has emerged as a critical bottleneck in scale-up systems. Programmable photonic interconnects offer a promising path forward: by dynamically reconfiguring the fabric, they can establish direct, high-bandwidth optical paths between communicating endpoints -- \emph{synchronously and guided by the structure of collective operations} (e.g., AllReduce). However, realizing this vision -- \emph{when light bends to the collective will} -- requires navigating a fundamental trade-off between reconfiguration delay and the performance gains of adaptive topologies.
  In this paper, we present a simple theoretical framework for adaptive photonic scale-up domains that makes this trade-off explicit and clarifies when reconfiguration is worthwhile. Along the way, we highlight a connection -- not surprising but still powerful -- between the Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN) decomposition, maximum concurrent flow (a classic measure of network throughput), and the well-known $\alpha$--$\beta$ cost model for collectives. Finally, we outline a research agenda in algorithm design and systems integration that can build on this foundation.</description>

      <title>URLLC for 6G Enabled Industry 5.0: A Taxonomy of Architectures, Cross Layer Techniques, and Time Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 introduces stringent requirements for ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) to support human centric, intelligent, and resilient industrial systems. Sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks aim to meet these requirements through sub-millisecond end-to-end delays, microsecond level jitter, and near perfect reliability, enabled by advances such as terahertz (THz) communication, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), multi-access edge computing (MEC), and AI driven cross layer optimization. This paper presents a comprehensive review of URLLC solutions for 6G enabled industry 5.0, organized into a structured taxonomy including application domains, key technical enablers, design challenges, and performance enhancements. The survey examines emerging approaches, including digital twin integration, AI/ML based resource orchestration, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) enabled service function chaining, and cross domain networking, while mapping them to critical industrial scenarios such as smart manufacturing, connected healthcare, autonomous mobility, remote control, and next-generation mobile networks. Performance trade-offs between latency, reliability, scalability, and energy efficiency are analyzed in the context of representative state-of-the-art studies. Finally, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to realize deterministic, secure, and sustainable URLLC architectures for Industry 5.0.</description>

      <title>BlockSDN: Towards a High-Performance Blockchain via Software-Defined Cross Networking optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability of blockchain systems is constrained by inefficient P2P broadcasting, as most existing optimizations focus only on the logical layer without considering physical network conditions. To address this, we propose BlockSDN, the first SDN-based integrated architecture for blockchain. BlockSDN employs a distributed control plane for a global network view, a graph engine for hierarchical clustering, and a hybrid macro-micro neighbor selection with hierarchical broadcasting. A dedicated simulation platform shows that BlockSDN reduces global block synchronization time by 65% and 55% compared to Gossip and Mercury, respectively.These results highlight the potential of SDN-enabled cross-layer coordination to significantly enhance blockchain scalability and performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Features Adaptation in Networking: Toward Flexible training and Explainable inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance (DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network use-cases.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-enhanced Low-Altitude UAV-Mounted Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless communication systems face challenges in meeting the demand for higher data rates and reliable connectivity in complex environments. Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising technology for advanced wave-domain signal processing, where mobile SIMs can outperform fixed counterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted SIM (UAV-SIM) assisted communication system within low-altitude economy (LAE) networks, where UAVs act as both cache-enabled base stations and mobile SIM carriers to enhance uplink transmissions. To maximize network capacity, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem (USBJOP) that integrates user association, UAV-SIM three-dimensional positioning, and multi-layer SIM phase shift design. Due to the non-convexity and NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three subproblems, which are the association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), the UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem (USPSOP). Then, we solve them through an alternating optimization strategy. Specifically, AUUOP and ULOP are transformed into convex forms solvable via the CVX tool, while USPSOP is addressed by a generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-based hybrid optimization algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves approximately 1.5 times higher network capacity compared with suboptimal schemes, effectively mitigates multi-user interference with increasing SIM layers and meta-atoms, and reduces runtime by 10\% while maintaining solution quality, thereby demonstrating its practicality for real-world deployments.</description>
