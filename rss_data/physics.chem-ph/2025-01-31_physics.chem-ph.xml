      <title>Optimal-Reference Excited State Methods: Static Correlation at Polynomial Cost with Single-Reference Coupled-Cluster Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate yet efficient modeling of chemical systems with pronounced static correlation in their excited states remains a significant challenge in quantum chemistry, as most electronic structure methods that can adequately capture static correlation scale factorially with system size. Researchers are often left with no option but to use more affordable methods that may lack the accuracy required to model critical processes in photochemistry such as photolysis, photocatalysis, and non-adiabatic relaxation. A great deal of work has been dedicated to refining single-reference descriptions of static correlation in the ground state via ``addition-by-subtraction'' coupled cluster methods such as pair coupled cluster with double substitutions (pCCD), singlet-paired CCD (CCD0), triplet-paired CCD (CCD1), and CCD with frozen singlet- or triplet-paired amplitudes (CCDf0/CCDf1). By combining wave functions derived from these methods with the intermediate state representation (ISR), we gain insights into the extensibility of single-reference coupled cluster theory's coverage of static correlation to the excited state problem. Our CCDf1-ISR(2) approach is robust in the face of static correlation and provides enough dynamical correlation to accurately predict excitation energies to within about 0.2~eV in small organic molecules. We also highlight distinct advantages of the Hermitian ISR construction, such as the avoidance of pathological failures of equation-of-motion methods for excited state potential energy surface topology. Our results prompt us to continue exploring optimal reference theories (excited state approaches that leverage dependence on the initial reference wave function) as a potentially economical approach to the excited state static correlation problem.</description>

      <title>MetaWFN: A Platform for Unified Implementation of Many-Electron Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \texttt{MetaWFN} is a C++ template-based architecture designed for flexible and rapid development of wavefunction-based quantum chemical methods. It is highly modular, extendable, and efficient. This is achieved by decoupling the three distinct aspects of quantum chemical methods
  (i.e., nature of Hamiltonian, structure of wavefunction, and strategy of parallelization ), thereby allowing for separate treatment of them through their internal type-trait and tagging systems furnished by C++ metaprogramming. Once the second-quantized Hamiltonians, whether nonrelativistic (spin-free) or relativistic (spin-dependent), are decomposed into topologically equivalent diagrams for a unified evaluation of the basic coupling coefficients between (randomly selected) spin-free or spin-dependent configuration state functions or Slater determinants incorporating full molecular symmetry (including single or double point group and spin or time reversal symmetry), the many-electron wavefunctions, whether built up with scalar or spinor orbitals, can be assembled with the same templates. As for parallelization, \texttt{MetaWFN} supports both OpenMP and MPI, with the majority of the latter being translated automatically from its OpenMP counterparts. The whole structure of \texttt{MetaWFN} is reviewed here, with some showcases for illustrating its performance.</description>

      <title>Freeze-and-release direct optimization method for variational calculations of excited electronic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-independent, orbital-optimized density functional approaches outperform time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in calculations of excited electronic states involving a large rearrangement of the electron density, such as charge transfer excitations. However, optimizing orbitals for excited states remains challenging, as the latter typically correspond to saddle points on the electronic energy surface. A simple and robust strategy for variational orbital optimization of excited states is presented. The approach involves two steps: (1) a constrained energy minimization, where a subset of orbitals changed by the excitation are frozen, followed by (2) a fully unconstrained saddle point optimization. The constrained minimization step makes it possible to identify the electronic degrees of freedom along which the energy needs to be maximized, preventing variational collapse. Both steps of this freeze-and-release strategy are carried out using direct optimization algorithms with a computational scaling comparable to ground state calculations. Numerical tests using a semilocal functional are performed on intramolecular charge transfer states of organic molecules and intermolecular charge transfer states of molecular dimers. It is shown that the freeze-and-release direct optimization (FR-DO) approach can successfully converge challenging charge transfer states, overcoming limitations of conventional algorithms based on the maximum overlap method, which either collapse to lower energy, charge-delocalized solutions or fail to converge. While FR-DO requires more iterations on average, the overall increase in computational cost is small. For the NH3-F2 dimer, it is found that unlike TDDFT, orbital-optimized calculations reproduce the correct long-range dependency of the energy with respect to the donor-acceptor separation without the need to include exact exchange in the long range.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</description>

      <title>Tensor network state methods and quantum information theory for strongly correlated molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A brief pedagogical overview of recent advances in tensor network state methods are presented that have the potential to broaden their scope of application radically for strongly correlated molecular systems. These include global fermionic mode optimization, i.e., a general approach to find an optimal matrix product state (MPS) parametrization of a quantum many-body wave function with the minimum number of parameters for a given error margin, the restricted active space DMRG-RAS-X method, multi-orbital correlations and entanglement, developments on hybrid CPU-multiGPU parallelization, and an efficient treatment of non-Abelian symmetries on high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures. Scaling analysis on NVIDIA DGX-A100 platform is also presented.</description>

      <title>Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>Molecular mechanism of Abeta alloform co-aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing kinetic experiments on protein aggregation using integrated rate laws has led to numerous advances in our understanding of the fundamental chemical mechanisms behind amyloidogenic disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, biologically relevant processes may be governed by rate equations that are too complex to solve using existing methods, hindering mechanistic insights into these processes. An example of significance is co-aggregation in environments containing multiple Abeta peptide alloforms, which may play a crucial role in the biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease but whose mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we develop using the mathematics of symmetry a highly general integrated rate law valid for most plausible linear self-assembly reactions. We use it in conjunction with experimental data to determine the mechanism of co-aggregation of Abeta42, Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 peptides. We find that Abeta42 fibril surfaces enable the formation of co-oligomers, which accelerate new Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 fibril formation whilst inhibiting secondary nucleation of new Abeta42 fibrils. The simplicity, accuracy and broad applicability of our general solution will encourage its widespread adoption by researchers modelling filamentous self-assembly kinetics, both with and without co-aggregation.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of Charge Densities in Electronic Structure Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate charge densities are essential for reliable electronic structure calculations because they significantly impact predictions of various chemical properties and in particular, according to the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, atomic forces. This study examines the accuracy of charge densities obtained from different DFT exchange-correlation functionals in comparison with coupled cluster calculations with single and double excitations. We find that modern DFT functionals can provide highly accurate charge densities, particularly in case of meta-GGA and hybrid functionals. In connection with Gaussian basis sets, it is necessary to use the largest basis sets available to obtain densitites that are nearly basis set error free. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate computational methods for generating high-precision charge densities, which are for instance needed to generate reference data for training modern machine learned potentials.</description>

      <title>Bridging DNP and MAS NMR dipolar recoupling -- from static single crystal to spinning powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin engineering of advanced pulse sequences has had a transformative impact on the development of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, to an extending degree also electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and the hybrid between the two, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Based on a simple formalism, we demonstrate that (i) single-crystal static-sample optimisations may tremendously ease design of experiments for rotating powders and (ii) pulse sequences may readily be exchanged between these distinct spectroscopies. Specifically, we design broadband heteronuclear solid-state NMR magic-angle-spinning (MAS) dipolar recoupling experiments based on the recently developed PLATO (PoLarizAtion Transfer via non-linear Optimization) microwave (MW) pulse sequence optimized on a single crystal for powder static-sample DNP. Using this concept, we demonstrate design of ultra-broadband 13C-15N and 2H-13C cross-polarization experiments, using PLATO on the 13C radio-frequency (RF) channel and square/ramped or RESPIRATION (Rotor Echo Short Pulse IRrAdiaTION) RF irradiation on the 15N and 2H RF channels, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantum suppression of cold reactions far from the s-wave energy limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reactions between pairs of atoms are ubiquitous processes in chemistry and physics. Quantum scattering effects on reactions often require extremely ultracold temperatures, approaching the $s$-wave regime, with a small number of partial waves involved. At higher temperatures, the different phases associated with the centrifugal barriers of different partial waves average out quantum interference to yield classical reaction rates. Here, we use quantum-logic to experimentally study resonant charge-exchange reactions between individual cold pairs of neutral $^{87}$Rb atoms and optically-inaccessible $^{87}$Rb$^{+}$ ions far above the $s$-wave regime. We find that the measured charge-exchange rate is significantly suppressed with respect to the classical prediction. Our results indicate that even at temperatures three orders of magnitude higher than the ultracold $s$-wave regime, quantum interference in collisions persists and impacts reaction rates.</description>

      <title>Advancing Natural Orbital Functional Calculations Through Deep Learning-Inspired Techniques for Large-Scale Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural orbital functional (NOF) theory offers a promising approach for studying strongly correlated systems at an affordable computational cost, with an accuracy comparable to highly demanding wavefunction-based methods. However, its widespread adoption in cases involving a large number of correlated electrons has been limited by the extensive iterations required for convergence. In this work, we present a disruptive approach that embeds the techniques used for optimization in deep learning within the NOF calculation, constituting a substantial advance in the scale of accessible systems. The revamped procedure is based on the adaptive momentum technique for orbital optimization, alternated with the optimization of the occupation numbers, significantly improving the computational feasibility of challenging calculations. This work represents a complete change in the size scale of the systems that can be reached using NOF theory. We demonstrate this with three examples that involve a large number of electrons: (i) the symmetric dissociation of a large hydrogen cluster, (ii) an analysis of occupancies distribution in fullerenes, and (iii) a study of the singlet-triplet energy gap in linear acenes. Notably, the hydrogen cluster calculation, featuring 1000 electrons, represents the largest NOF calculation performed to date and one of the largest strongly correlated electron calculations ever reported. This system, which serves as an ideal model for a strongly correlated Mott insulator, illustrates a metal-to-insulator transition where all electrons participate in the correlation phenomenon, offering insight in a unique challenge. We anticipate that this work will enable the practical application of NOFs to increasingly complex and intriguing systems, leveraging the method's inherent scalability and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Generating novel molecules with higher properties than the training space, namely the out-of-distribution generation, is important for ${de~novo}$ drug design. However, it is not easy for distribution learning-based models, for example diffusion models, to solve this challenge as these methods are designed to fit the distribution of training data as close as possible. In this paper, we show that Bayesian flow network is capable of effortlessly generating high quality out-of-distribution samples that meet several scenarios. We introduce a semi-autoregressive training/sampling method that helps to enhance the model performance and surpass the state-of-the-art models.</description>
