      <title>Constructing solutions of simplex equations from polygon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study polygon equations and their connections to simplex equations, which generalize the pentagon and Yang--Baxter equations, respectively. First, we show that certain "commutative" pairs of solutions of (dual) polygon equations give rise to solutions of higher polygon equations. Next, we define an explicit compatibility condition between solutions of the $n$-gon and dual $n$-gon equations and use it to construct solutions of the $(n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-simplex equations. This extends earlier work by Kashaev--Sergeev and Dimakis--H\"uller-Hoissen.</description>

      <title>On the Hierarchy of Scales in Modeling of Weakly Interacting Chains of Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we apply a well known discrete-to-continuum approach to a Frenkel-Kontorova-type model of an infinitely long one-dimensional chain of atoms weakly interacting with a line of fixed atoms. The rescaled model contains a small parameter $\delta$ that is the ratio of the strengths of the weak interaction and the elastic interaction. After replacing discrete displacements with piecewise affine functions to define continuum versions of the discrete energies, we prove that these energies $\Gamma$-converge to a continuum energy as $\delta\rightarrow 0$. This limiting process represents a transition from the microscale, at which individual atoms are resolved, to a mesoscale with a single diffuse domain wall. In the second part of this paper, we introduce an additional rescaling $\varepsilon$, and an associated limiting process that converts our problem to the macroscale. The $\varepsilon$-limiting energy is finite for piecewise constant functions of bounded variation. In the context of our problem, each point of discontinuity of a minimizer of the limiting energy corresponds to a sharp domain wall.</description>

      <title>Totally Anti-symmetric Spinor Tensors in Minkowski Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinor tensor $\epsilon_{AB}$ has a special property that its elements can be formulated into an algebraic expression of the indices. All the totally anti-symmetric tensors in Minkowski space are expressed by $\epsilon_{AB}$. By using the property, we give a simple proof of the total anti-symmetry for the volume spinor tensor.</description>

      <title>Statistical phase-space complexity of continuous-variable quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical complexity of continuous-variable quantum states can be characterized with a quantifier defined in terms of information-theoretic quantities derived from the Husimi Q-function. In this work, we utilize this complexity quantifier of quantum states to study the complexity of single-mode bosonic quantum channels. We define the complexity of quantum channels as the maximal amount of complexity they can generate from an initial state with the minimal complexity. We illustrate this concept by evaluating the complexity of Gaussian channels and some examples of non-Gaussian channels.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate Twisted Bilayer Graphene: emerging quasi-periodicity and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a lattice model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG). The presence of incommensurate angles produces an emerging quasi-periodicity manifesting itself in large momenta Umklapp interactions that almost connect the Dirac points. We rigorously establish the stability of the semimetallic phase via a Renormalization Group analysis combined with number theoretical properties of irrationals, similar to the ones used in Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory for the stability of invariant tori. The interlayer hopping is weak and short ranged and the angles are chosen in a large measure set. The result provides a justification, in the above regime, to the effective continuum description of TBG in which large momenta interlayer interactions are neglected.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear fluctuations for a chain of weakly anharmonic oscillators with stochastic perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the phonon modes in a one-dimensional chain of anharmonic oscillators where the deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics is perturbed by random exchanges of momentum between nearest neighbor particles. There are three locally conserved quantities: volume, momentum and energy. We study the evolution in equilibrium of the fluctuation fields of the two phonon modes (linear combination of the volume stretch and momentum), on a diffusive space-time scale after recentering on their sound velocities. We show that, weakening the anharmonicity with the scale parameter, the recentered phonon fluctuations fields converge to the stationary solutions of two uncoupled stochastic Burgers equations. The nonlinearity in the Burgers equation depends on the presence of a cubic term in the anharmonic potential (corresponding to the $\alpha$-FPUT dynamics). Main ingredients of the proof, based on a compactness argument for the Dynkin's martingale decomposition, are the second-order Boltzmann-Gibbs principle, as well as equipartition of energy, to characterize the nonlinear term and Riemann-Lebesgue estimates showing that fields with diverging velocity to different directions have no interaction in the limit.</description>

      <title>Neutral Deformation Modes of Minimal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stretching, drilling, and bending are the independent deformation modes of a thin shell, each of which has an individual energy content. When the energy content of a mode vanishes, that mode is neutral. We characterize all neutral modes of deformation of minimal surfaces into minimal surfaces. A hierarchy is found among these: a stretching neutral mode (which is an isometry) is also drilling neutral, and a drilling neutral mode is also bending neutral. Thus, all isometries of a minimal surface are globally neutral and give rise to soft elasticity. More generally, all minimal surfaces can be classified relative to a reference one in terms of three energy contents, which can be given in closed form.</description>

      <title>On Physical Mathematics: an approach through Gilles Ch\^atelet's philosophy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from Greg Moore's description about Physical Mathematics, a framework is proposed in order to understand it, based on Gilles Ch\^atelet's philosophy. It will be argued that Ch\^atelet's ideas of inverting, splitting, augmenting and virtuality are crucial in the discussion about the nature of Physical Mathematics. Along this line, it will be proposed that mirror symmetry is a natural study case to test Ch\^atelet's ideas in this context. This should be considered as a first step in a long term project aiming to study the relations among mathematics, physics and philosophy in the construction of a global understanding of the structure of the universe, as it was envisioned by Grothendieck in the late 80's of the last century and it was started to be developed independently by Ch\^atelet in the beginning of the 90's. The main suggestion of the essay is that it is in the relations between mathematics, physics and philosophy that new knowledge arises.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles for the Gross Pitaevskii Gibbs measure at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the large deviation principle for the conditional Gibbs measure associated with the focusing Gross Pitaevskii equation in the low temperature regime. This conditional measure is of mixed type, being canonical in energy and microcanonical in particle number. In particular, our result extends the large deviation principle for the mixed ensemble studied by Ellis, Jordan, Otto, and Turkington to a more singular setting, where the interaction potential is unbounded and the conditional event involves diverging renormalization constants. As a consequence of the large deviation principle, the Gibbs measure concentrates along the soliton manifold in the low temperature limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupled angular momentum is an integrable system with two degrees of freedom which is fundamental in physics and the theory of integrable systems. It is obtained by coupling two angular momenta. We construct a $p$-adic analog of this system for any prime number $p$ and describe its symplectic normal forms at the critical points. This analog has a rich singularity theory with up to thirteen non-equivalent symplectic normal forms, which stands in contrast with the real case where there are exactly three normal forms.</description>

      <title>Near-critical Ornstein--Zernike theory for the planar random-cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an Ornstein--Zernike theory for the two-dimensional random-cluster model with $1 \leq q &lt;4$ that also applies in its near-critical regime. In particular, we prove an asymptotic formula for the two-point function which holds uniformly for~$p &lt; p_c$ and blends the subcritical and near-critical behaviours of the model.
  The analysis is carried out by studying the renewal properties of a subcritical percolation cluster, \emph{at the scale of the correlation length}. More precisely, we explore sequentially the cluster in a given direction, by slices of thickness comparable to the correlation length. We show that this exploration satisfies the properties of a {\em killed Markov renewal process} -- a class of processes that may be analysed independently and have Brownian behaviour. In addition to the two-point function estimate, we derive other consequences of the Ornstein--Zernike theory such as an invariance principle for the rescaled cluster and the strict convexity of the inverse correlation length -- all at the scale of the correlation length, uniformly in~$p&lt;p_c$.
  Finally, our approach differs from that of earlier papers of Campanino, Ioffe, Velenik and others, with the cluster being dynamically explored rather than constructed from its diamond decomposition.</description>

      <title>Uvarov Perturbations for Multiple Orthogonal Polynomials of the Mixed Type on the Step-Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uvarov-type perturbations for mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomials on the step line are investigated within a matrix-analytic framework. The transformations considered involve both rational and additive modifications of a rectangular matrix of measures, implemented through left and right multiplication by regular matrix polynomials together with the addition of finitely many discrete matrix masses. These operations induce structured finite-band modifications of the corresponding moment matrix and rational transformations of the associated Markov-Stieltjes matrix function. Explicit Uvarov-type connection formulas are obtained, relating the perturbed and unperturbed families of mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomials, and determinant conditions ensuring the existence of the new orthogonality are established. The algebraic consequences of these transformations are analyzed, showing their effect on the structure of the block-banded recurrence operators and on the spectral data encoded in the Markov-Stieltjes matrix functions. As an illustrative example, nontrivial Uvarov-type perturbations of the Jacobi-Pi\~neiro multiple orthogonal polynomials are presented. The results unify Christoffel, Geronimus, and Uvarov transformations within a single matrix framework, providing a linear-algebraic perspective on rational and additive spectral transformations of structured moment matrices and their corresponding recurrence operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the approach from [arXiv:2110.15301] to prove windowed spectral projection estimates and a generalized Weyl law for the (Weyl) quantized baker's map on the torus. The spectral window is allowed to shrink in the semiclassical (large dimension) limit. As a consequence, we obtain a strengthening of the quantum ergodic theorem from [arXiv:math-ph/0412058] to hold in shrinking spectral windows, a Weyl law on uniform spreading of eigenvalues, and statistics of random quasimodes. Using similar techniques, we also investigate random eigenbases of a different (non-Weyl) quantization, the Walsh-quantized baker's map, which has high degeneracies in its spectrum. For such random eigenbases, we prove that Gaussian eigenstate statistics and QUE hold with high probability in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Further Evidence for Near-Tsirelson Bell-CHSH Violations in Quantum Field Theory via Haar Wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a recent construction using bumpified Haar wavelets to demonstrate explicit violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality within the vacuum state in quantum field theory. The construction was tested for massless spinor fields in $(1+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and is claimed to achieve violations arbitrarily close to an upper bound known as Tsirelson's bound. We show that this claim can be reduced to a mathematical conjecture involving the maximal eigenvalue of a sequence of symmetric matrices composed of integrals of Haar wavelet products. More precisely, the asymptotic eigenvalue of this sequence should approach $\pi$. We present a formal argument using a subclass of wavelets, allowing us to reach $3.11052$. Although a complete proof remains elusive, we present further compelling numerical evidence to support it.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of external potentials on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ for which the coincidence set to the obstacle problem contains a Jordan curve in the exterior of the droplet. We refer to this curve as a spectral outpost. We study the corresponding Coulomb gas at $\beta=2$. Generalizing recent work in the radially symmetric case, we prove that the number of particles which fall near the spectral outpost has an asymptotic Heine distribution, as the number of particles $n\to\infty$.We also consider a class of potentials with disconnected droplets whose connected components are separated by a ring-shaped spectral gap. We prove that the fluctuations of the number of particles that fall near a given component has an asymptotic discrete normal distribution, which depends on $n$. For the case of disconnected droplets we also consider fluctuations of general smooth linear statistics and show that they tend to distribute as the sum of a Gaussian field and an independent, oscillatory, discrete Gaussian field. Our techniques involve a new asymptotic formula on the norm of monic orthogonal polynomials in the bifurcation regime and a variant of the method of limit Ward identities of Ameur, Hedenmalm, and Makarov.</description>

      <title>Duality, asymptotic charges and algebraic topology in mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the duality map between electric-like asymptotic charges of $p$-form gauge theories is studied. The outcome is an existence and uniqueness theorem and the topological nature of the duality map. The goal of this work is to extend that theorem in the case of mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories in order to have a deeper understanding of exotic gauge theories, of the non-trivial charges associated to them and of the duality of their observables. Unlike the simpler case of $p$-form gauge theories, here we need to develop some mathematical tools. The crucial points are to view a mixed symmetry tensor as a Young projected object of the $N$-multi-form space and to develop an analogue of de Rham complex for mixed symmetry tensors. As a result, if the underlying manifold satisfy appropriate conditions, the duality map can be proven to exist and to be unique ensuring the charge of a description has information on the dual ones. Moreover, we provide some physical applications ranging form fractons and higher symmetries to string theory and holography.</description>

      <title>A rigorous formulation of Density Functional Theory for spinless fermions in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a completely rigorous formulation of Kohn-Sham density functional theory for spinless fermions living in one dimensional space. More precisely, we consider Schr\"odinger operators of the form $H_N(v,w) = -\Delta + \sum_{i\neq j}^N w(x_i,x_j) + \sum_{j=1}^N v(x_i)$ acting on $\wedge^N \mathrm{L}^2([0,1])$, where the external and interaction potentials $v$ and $w$ belong to a suitable class of distributions. In this setting, we obtain a complete characterization of the set of pure-state $v$-representable densities on the interval. Then, we prove a Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that applies to the class of distributional potentials studied here. Lastly, we establish the differentiability of the exchange-correlation functional and therefore the existence of a unique exchange-correlation potential. We then combine these results to provide a rigorous formulation of the Kohn-Sham scheme. In particular, these results show that the Kohn-Sham scheme is rigorously exact in this setting.</description>

      <title>Detecting screens modeled by Schr\"odinger operators that generate $C_0$ contraction semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function $\psi$ in a bounded $C^2$ region $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and suppose detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. Assume the detection process is irreversible, its mechanism is time independent and also hard, i.e., detections occur only along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. Under these conditions Tumulka informally argued that the dynamics of $\psi$ must be governed by a $C_0$ contraction semigroup that weakly solves the Schr\"odinger equation and proposed modeling the detector by a time-independent local absorbing boundary condition at $\partial \Omega$. In this paper, we apply the newly discovered theory of boundary quadruples to parameterize all $C_0$ contraction semigroups whose generators extend the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian, and prove a variant of Tumulka's claim: all such evolutions are generated by the placement of a linear absorbing boundary condition on $\psi$ along $\partial \Omega$. We combine this result with the work of Werner to show that each $C_0$ contraction semigroup naturally admits a Born rule for the time of detection along $\partial \Omega$, and we prove that a detection will almost surely occur in finite time if detectors have been placed everywhere along $\partial \Omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the work of Belliard, Pimenta and Slavnov (2024) studying the modified rational six vertex model. We find another formula of the partition function for the inhomogeneous model, in terms of a determinant that mix the modified Izergin one and a Vandermonde one. This expression enables us to compute the partition function in the homogeneous limit for the rectangular lattice, and then to study the thermodynamic limit. It leads to a new result, we obtain the first order of free energy with boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is standard to construct the Incipient Infinite Cluster as the limit of the critical percolation measure conditioned on 0 being connected to radius n, as n tends to infinity. We provide a short proof of that convergence in the planar setting. A key step in the proof is to introduce an unbiased percolation configuration above which are coupled two percolations conditioned on 0 being connected to different radii. It implies a speed of convergence in total variation distance to the IIC measure upper-bounded by the dual one-arm probability, which is the first occurrence of an explicit upperbound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mathematical framework for reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) is proposed. The work is inspired by and generalizes the work by E.H.~Lieb [E.H. Lieb, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 24(1983), pp.243--277] on density-functional theory (DFT). We introduce a Banach space for density matrices with finite kinetic energy. The dual space is a rich class of single-particle potentials, i.e., Hermitian forms. The ground state energy of an $N$-fermion system with external forces given by any such Hermitian form is expressed as the Legendre--Fenchel transform of a convex and lower semicontinuous ``universal'' reduced density matrix functional. The formalism is employed to provide a mathematical framework for density-functional theory (DFT). The main tool here is a rigorous definition of diagonals of reduced density matrices. The result is a refinement of Lieb's results on DFT applicable to a wide variety of models.</description>

Abstract: We study several polynomial Hamiltonian systems of PIV-type (including the mixed case quasi-PIV), and show that via the iterative process of polynomial regularisation, it is possible to identify the "minimal" Hamiltonian system.

Abstract: We develop lower bounds for the energy of configurations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ periodic with respect to a lattice. In certain cases, the construction of sharp bounds can be formulated as a finite dimensional, multivariate polynomial interpolation problem. We use this framework to show a scaling of the equitriangular lattice $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $\omega_4+ A_2$ where $\omega_4$ is a 4-point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Likewise, we show a scaling and rotation of $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $\omega_6+L$ where $\omega_6$ is a 6-point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $L=\mathbb{Z} \times \sqrt{3} \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Convergence Rate of Lie-Trotter Approximation for Quantum Thermal Averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Two-pointed quantum disks with a weight parameter $W&gt;0$ is a canonical family of finite-volume random surfaces in Liouville quantum gravity. We extend the conformal welding of quantum disks in [AHS23] to the non-simple regime, and give a construction of the multiple SLE associated with any given link pattern for $\kappa\in(4,8)$. Our proof is based on connections between SLE and Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT), where we show that in the conformal welding of multiple forested quantum disks, the surface after welding can be described in terms of LCFT, and the random conformal moduli contains the SLE partition function for the interfaces as a multiplicative factor. As a corollary, for $\kappa\in(4,8)$, we prove the existence of the multiple SLE partition functions, which are smooth functions satisfying a system of PDEs and conformal covariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the singularity structure of FLRW spacetimes without particle horizons at the $C^0$-level of the metric. We show that in the case of constant spatial curvature $K=+1$, and without any further assumptions on the scale factor, the big bang singularity is sufficiently strong to exclude continuous spacetime extensions to the past. On the other hand it is known that in the case of constant spatial curvature $K=-1$ continuous spacetime extensions through the big-bang exist for certain choices of scale factor [4], giving rise to Milne-like cosmologies. Complementing these results we exhibit a geometric obstruction to continuous spacetime extensions which is present for a large range of scale factors in the case $K=-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ising model is famous in condensed matter and statistical physics. In this work we present a free-fermion formulation of the two-dimensional classical Ising models on the honeycomb, triangular and Kagom\'e lattices. Each Ising model is studied in the cases of a zero field and of an imaginary field $i(\pi/2){k_B}T$. We employ the decorated lattice technique, star-triangle transformation and weak-graph expansion method to exactly map each Ising model in both cases into an eight-vertex model on the square lattice. The resulting vertex weights are shown to satisfy the free-fermion condition. In the zero field case, each Ising model is an even free-fermion model. In the case of the imaginary field, the Ising model on the honeycomb lattice is an even free-fermion model while the models on the triangular and Kagom\'e lattices are odd free-fermion models. We obtain the exact solution of the Kagom\'e lattice Ising model under the imaginary field $i(\pi/2){k_B}T$, a result not previously reported in the literature. We also show that the frustrated Ising models on the triangular and Kagom\'e lattices in the imaginary field still exhibit a non-zero residual entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fields of entanglement theory and tensor networks have recently emerged as central tools for characterising quantum phases of matter. In this article, we determine the entanglement structure of ground states of gapped symmetric quantum lattice models, and use this to obtain the most efficient tensor network representation of those ground states. We do this by showing that degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum arise through a duality transformation of the original model to the unique dual model where the entire dual (generalised) symmetry is spontaneously broken and subsequently no degeneracies are present. Physically, this duality transformation amounts to a (twisted) gauging of the unbroken symmetry in the original ground state. This result has strong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using variational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the dual representation of the ground state that completely breaks the symmetry minimises both the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a generalised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual) constrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over traditional tensor network methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to the usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal category theoretic description for the practical simulation of strongly correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: We are interested in inequalities that bound the Riesz means of the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians in terms of their semiclassical counterpart. We show that the classical inequalities of Berezin-Li-Yau and Kr\"oger, valid for Riesz exponents $\gamma\geq 1$, extend to certain values $\gamma&lt;1$, provided the underlying domain is convex. We also study the corresponding optimization problems and describe the implications of a possible failure of P\'olya's conjecture for convex sets in terms of Riesz means. These findings allow us to describe the asymptotic behavior of solutions of a spectral shape optimization problem for convex sets.</description>

Quoting Philip Anderson: "more is different". This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks to show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord. Here, restricting to notes coded as Rademacher vectors and chords that are their mixtures (i.e., spurious states), we use tools borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems to investigate this task, obtaining the conditions over the model control-parameters such that pattern disentanglement is successfully executed.</description>

      <title>The counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule is sufficient to rule out ontological models of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule -- which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself -- renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</description>

      <title>Construction of blowup solutions for Liouville systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the following Liouville system defined on a flat torus \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} -\Delta u_i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j\Big(\frac{h_j e^{u_j}}{\int_\Omega h_j e^{u_j}}-1\Big),\nonumber \\ u_j\in H_{per}^1(\Omega)\mbox{ for }i\in I=\{1,\cdots,n\}\nonumber, \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $h_j\in C^3(\Omega)$, $h_j&gt;0$, $\rho_j&gt;0$ and $u=(u_1,..,u_n)$ is doubly periodic on $\partial\Omega$. The matrix $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ satisfies certain properties. One central problem about Liouville systems is whether multi-bubble solutions do exist. In this work we present a comprehensive construction of multi-bubble solutions in the most general setting.</description>

      <title>The importance of being empty: a spectral approach to Hopfield neural networks with diluted examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Hopfield networks, where neurons interact pair-wise by Hebbian couplings built over $i$. a set of definite patterns (ground truths), $ii$. a sample of labeled examples (supervised setting), $iii$. a sample of unlabeled examples (unsupervised setting). We focus on the case where ground-truths are Rademacher vectors and examples are noisy versions of these ground-truths, possibly displaying some blank entries (e.g., mimicking missing or dropped data), and we determine the spectral distribution of the coupling matrices in the three scenarios, by exploiting and extending the Marchenko-Pastur theorem. By levering this knowledge, we are able to analytically inspect the stability and attractiveness of the ground truths, as well as the generalization capabilities of the networks. In particular, as corroborated by long-running Monte Carlo simulations, the presence of black entries can have benefits in some specific conditions, suggesting strategies based on data sparsification; the robustness of these results in structured datasets is confirmed numerically. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hebbian matrix, built on sparse examples, can be recovered as the fixed point of a gradient descent algorithm with dropout, over a suitable loss function.</description>

      <title>Solitons of the constrained Schr\"odinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the linear vector Schr\"odinger equation subjected to quadratic constraints. We demonstrate that the resulting nonlinear system is closely related to the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy and use this fact to derive the N-soliton solutions for the discussed model. As an example of application of these results we present solitons of some vector nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with gradient nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Random 2D linear cocycles II: statistical properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the space of two dimensional random linear cocycles over a shift in finitely many symbols, with at least one singular and one invertible matrix. We provide an explicit formula for the unique stationary measure associated to such cocycles and establish a Furstenberg-type formula characterizing the Lyapunov exponent. Using the spectral properties of the corresponding Markov operator and a parameter elimination argument, we prove that Lebesgue almost every cocycle in this space satisfies large deviations estimates and a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>A microscopic Normal Matrix Model for $(A)dS_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the duality between the gravitating $c=1$ (compact) Sine-Gordon model and a normal matrix model. From a two-dimensional quantum gravity perspective and due to the periodic nature of the potential, this model admits both anti-de Sitter and de-Sitter saddles, similarly to simpler models of Sine-Dilaton gravity, as well as more complicated interpolating "wineglass wormhole" geometries. From a string theory perspective the Euclidean de-Sitter (genus zero) saddles are related to the presence of a classical entropic contribution associated to the target space geometry. The gravitating Sine-Gordon model corresponds to a well defined CFT by construction and the eigenvalues of the dual normal matrix model are supported in a compact region of the complex plane. The duality with the normal matrix model is operationally defined even for a finite, but sufficiently large matrix size $N$, depending on the precise observable to be determined. We define and study a "microscopic" version of the large-N limit that allows us to recover non-perturbative results for all physical observables.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of Non-Mean-Field Random Matrices in Dimensions $d\ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $N \times N$ random band matrices $H = (H_{xy})$ with mean-zero complex Gaussian entries, where $x,y$ lie on the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z} / \sqrt[d]{N} \mathbb{Z})^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$. The variance profile satisfies $\mathbb{E}|H_{xy}|^2 = S_{xy}$, with $S_{xy} = 0$ whenever the distance between $x$ and $y$ exceeds a bandwidth parameter $W$. We prove that if $W \geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$ for some constant $\mathfrak{c} &gt; 0$, then in the large-$N$ limit, bulk eigenvectors are delocalized, quantum unique ergodicity (QUE) holds, and the local bulk eigenvalue statistics are universal. Our proof is based on the tree approximation of the loop hierarchy (arXiv:2501.01718) and diagrammatic techniques developed in earlier works (arXiv:1807.02447, arXiv:2104.12048, arXiv:2107.05795, arXiv:2412.15207, arXiv:2503.07606).
  Besides random band matrices, we also study two classical non-mean-field random matrix models: the Wegner orbital and the block Anderson models. Specifically, we consider Hermitian matrices $H = V + g \Psi$ on the same discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z} / \sqrt[d]{N} \mathbb{Z})^d$, where $V$ is a random block potential consisting of i.i.d. complex Gaussian diagonal blocks of size $W^d \times W^d$, and $\Psi$ encodes the interactions between neighboring blocks -- random in the Wegner orbital model and deterministic in the block Anderson model. The parameter $g &gt; 0$ represents the coupling strength between blocks. Assuming again that $W \geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$, we establish delocalization of bulk eigenvectors, QUE, and bulk universality under the condition $W^{-d/2+\varepsilon}\le g \le \varepsilon^{-1}$ for any small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Combined with the localization results of arXiv:1608.02922 for $g \ll W^{-d/2}$, this identifies a localization--delocalization transition at the scale $g=W^{-d/2}$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Feynman Formula for Discrete-time Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly connect (discrete-time) quantum walks on Z with a four-state Markov additive process via a Feynman-type formula (2.5). Using this representation, we derive a relation between the spectral decomposition of the Markov additive process and the limiting density of the homogeneous quantum walk. In addition, we consider a space-time rescaling of quantum walks, which leads to a system of quantum transport PDEs in continuous time and space with a phase interaction term. Our probabilistic representation for this type of PDE offers an efficient Monte Carlo computational technique.</description>
