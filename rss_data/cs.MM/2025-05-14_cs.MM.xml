      <title>SciCom Wiki: Fact-Checking and FAIR Knowledge Distribution for Scientific Videos and Podcasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Democratic societies need accessible, reliable information. Videos and Podcasts have established themselves as the medium of choice for civic dissemination, but also as carriers of misinformation. The emerging Science Communication Knowledge Infrastructure (SciCom KI) curating non-textual media is still fragmented and not adequately equipped to scale against the content flood. Our work sets out to support the SciCom KI with a central, collaborative platform, the SciCom Wiki, to facilitate FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) media representation and the fact-checking of their content, particularly for videos and podcasts. Building an open-source service system centered around Wikibase, we survey requirements from 53 stakeholders, refine these in 11 interviews, and evaluate our prototype based on these requirements with another 14 participants. To address the most requested feature, fact-checking, we developed a neurosymbolic computational fact-checking approach, converting heterogenous media into knowledge graphs. This increases machine-readability and allows comparing statements against equally represented ground-truth. Our computational fact-checking tool was iteratively evaluated through 10 expert interviews, a public user survey with 43 participants verified the necessity and usability of our tool. Overall, our findings identified several needs to systematically support the SciCom KI. The SciCom Wiki, as a FAIR digital library complementing our neurosymbolic computational fact-checking framework, was found suitable to address the raised requirements. Further, we identified that the SciCom KI is severely underdeveloped regarding FAIR knowledge and related systems facilitating its collaborative creation and curation. Our system can provide a central knowledge node, yet a collaborative effort is required to scale against the imminent (mis-)information flood.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Computer-Aided Design: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancements in recent years, with models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, showcasing their remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While substantial research has been conducted on LLMs in various fields, a comprehensive review focusing on their integration with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) remains notably absent. CAD is the industry standard for 3D modeling and plays a vital role in the design and development of products across different industries. As the complexity of modern designs increases, the potential for LLMs to enhance and streamline CAD workflows presents an exciting frontier. This article presents the first systematic survey exploring the intersection of LLMs and CAD. We begin by outlining the industrial significance of CAD, highlighting the need for AI-driven innovation. Next, we provide a detailed overview of the foundation of LLMs. We also examine both closed-source LLMs as well as publicly available models. The core of this review focuses on the various applications of LLMs in CAD, providing a taxonomy of six key areas where these models are making considerable impact. Finally, we propose several promising future directions for further advancements, which offer vast opportunities for innovation and are poised to shape the future of CAD technology.

      <title>Fast Text-to-Audio Generation with Adversarial Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08175v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio systems, while increasingly performant, are slow at inference time, thus making their latency unpractical for many creative applications. We present Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) post-training, the first adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow models not based on distillation. While past adversarial post-training methods have struggled to compare against their expensive distillation counterparts, ARC post-training is a simple procedure that (1) extends a recent relativistic adversarial formulation to diffusion/flow post-training and (2) combines it with a novel contrastive discriminator objective to encourage better prompt adherence. We pair ARC post-training with a number optimizations to Stable Audio Open and build a model capable of generating $\approx$12s of 44.1kHz stereo audio in $\approx$75ms on an H100, and $\approx$7s on a mobile edge-device, the fastest text-to-audio model to our knowledge.</description>

      <title>FMNV: A Dataset of Media-Published News Videos for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: News media, particularly video-based platforms, have become deeply embed-ded in daily life, concurrently amplifying the risks of misinformation dissem-ination. Consequently, multimodal fake news detection has garnered signifi-cant research attention. However, existing datasets predominantly comprise user-generated videos characterized by crude editing and limited public en-gagement, whereas professionally crafted fake news videos disseminated by media outlets-often politically or virally motivated-pose substantially greater societal harm. To address this gap, we construct FMNV, a novel da-taset exclusively composed of news videos published by media organizations. Through empirical analysis of existing datasets and our curated collection, we categorize fake news videos into four distinct types. Building upon this taxonomy, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate deceptive content by manipulating authentic media-published news videos. Furthermore, we propose FMNVD, a baseline model featuring a dual-stream architecture that integrates spatio-temporal motion features from a 3D ResNeXt-101 backbone and static visual semantics from CLIP. The two streams are fused via an attention-based mechanism, while co-attention modules refine the visual, textual, and audio features for effective multi-modal aggregation. Comparative experiments demonstrate both the generali-zation capability of FMNV across multiple baselines and the superior detec-tion efficacy of FMNVD. This work establishes critical benchmarks for de-tecting high-impact fake news in media ecosystems while advancing meth-odologies for cross-modal inconsistency analysis. Our dataset is available in https://github.com/DennisIW/FMNV.</description>
