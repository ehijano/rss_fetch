      <title>Toward Practical Privacy in XR: Empirical Analysis of Multimodal Anonymization Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As extended reality (XR) systems become increasingly immersive and sensor-rich, they enable the collection of fine-grained behavioral signals such as eye and body telemetry. These signals support personalized and responsive experiences and may also contain unique patterns that can be linked back to individuals. However, privacy mechanisms that naively pair unimodal mechanisms (e.g., independently apply privacy mechanisms for eye and body privatization) are often ineffective at preventing re-identification in practice. In this work, we systematically evaluate real-time privacy mechanisms for XR, both individually and in pair, across eye and body modalities. To preserve usability, all mechanisms were tuned based on empirically grounded thresholds for real-time interaction. We evaluated four eye and ten body mechanisms across multiple datasets, comprising up to 407 participants. Our results show that while obfuscating eye telemetry alone offers moderate privacy gains, body telemetry perturbation is substantially more effective. When carefully paired, multimodal mechanisms reduce re-identification rate from 80.3% to 26.3% in casual XR applications (e.g., VRChat and Job Simulator) and from 84.8% to 26.1% in competitive XR applications (e.g., Beat Saber and Synth Riders), all without violating real-time usability requirements. These findings underscore the potential of modality-specific and context-aware privacy strategies for protecting behavioral data in XR environments.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of User-Centred Evaluation of Explainable AI in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite promising developments in Explainable Artificial Intelligence, the practical value of XAI methods remains under-explored and insufficiently validated in real-world settings. Robust and context-aware evaluation is essential, not only to produce understandable explanations but also to ensure their trustworthiness and usability for intended users, but tends to be overlooked because of no clear guidelines on how to design an evaluation with users.
  This study addresses this gap with two main goals: (1) to develop a framework of well-defined, atomic properties that characterise the user experience of XAI in healthcare; and (2) to provide clear, context-sensitive guidelines for defining evaluation strategies based on system characteristics.
  We conducted a systematic review of 82 user studies, sourced from five databases, all situated within healthcare settings and focused on evaluating AI-generated explanations. The analysis was guided by a predefined coding scheme informed by an existing evaluation framework, complemented by inductive codes developed iteratively.
  The review yields three key contributions: (1) a synthesis of current evaluation practices, highlighting a growing focus on human-centred approaches in healthcare XAI; (2) insights into the interrelations among explanation properties; and (3) an updated framework and a set of actionable guidelines to support interdisciplinary teams in designing and implementing effective evaluation strategies for XAI systems tailored to specific application contexts.</description>

      <title>"I Cannot Write This Because It Violates Our Content Policy": Understanding Content Moderation Policies and User Experiences in Generative AI Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent research has focused on developing safeguards for generative AI (GAI) model-level content safety, little is known about how content moderation to prevent malicious content performs for end-users in real-world GAI products. To bridge this gap, we investigated content moderation policies and their enforcement in GAI online tools -- consumer-facing web-based GAI applications. We first analyzed content moderation policies of 14 GAI online tools. While these policies are comprehensive in outlining moderation practices, they usually lack details on practical implementations and are not specific about how users can aid in moderation or appeal moderation decisions. Next, we examined user-experienced content moderation successes and failures through Reddit discussions on GAI online tools. We found that although moderation systems succeeded in blocking malicious generations pervasively, users frequently experienced frustration in failures of both moderation systems and user support after moderation. Based on these findings, we suggest improvements for content moderation policy and user experiences in real-world GAI products.</description>

      <title>FEWSim: A Visual Analytic Framework for Exploring the Nexus of Food-Energy-Water Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interdependencies of food, energy, and water (FEW) systems create a nexus opportunity to explore the strengths and vulnerabilities of individual and cross-sector interactions within FEW systems. However, the variables quantifying nexus interactions are hard to observe, which hinders the cross-sector analysis. To overcome such challenges, we present FEWSim, a visual analytics framework designed to support domain experts in exploring and interpreting simulation results from a coupled FEW model. FEWSim employs a three-layer asynchronous architecture: the model layer integrates food, energy, and water models to simulate the FEW nexus; the middleware layer manages scenario configuration and execution; and the visualization layer provides interactive visual exploration of simulated time-series results across FEW sectors. The visualization layer further facilitates the exploration across multiple scenarios and evaluates scenario differences in performance using sustainability indices of the FEW nexus. We demonstrate the utility of FEWSim through a case study for the Phoenix Active Management Area (AMA) in Arizona.</description>

      <title>The Teacher's Dilemma: Balancing Trade-Offs in Programming Education for Emergent Bilingual Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K-12 computing teachers must navigate complex trade-offs when selecting programming languages and instructional materials for classrooms with emergent bilingual students. While they aim to foster an inclusive learning environment by addressing language barriers that impact student engagement, they must also align with K-12 computer science curricular guidelines and prepare students for industry-standard programming tools. Because programming languages predominantly use English keywords and most instructional materials are written in English, these linguistic barriers introduce cognitive load and accessibility challenges. This paper examines teachers' decisions in balancing these competing priorities, highlighting the tensions between accessibility, curriculum alignment, and workforce preparation. The findings shed light on how our teacher participants negotiate these trade-offs and what factors influence their selection of programming tools to best support EB students while meeting broader educational and professional goals.</description>

      <title>StorySage: Conversational Autobiography Writing Powered by a Multi-Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every individual carries a unique and personal life story shaped by their memories and experiences. However, these memories are often scattered and difficult to organize into a coherent narrative, a challenge that defines the task of autobiography writing. Existing conversational writing assistants tend to rely on generic user interactions and pre-defined guidelines, making it difficult for these systems to capture personal memories and develop a complete biography over time. We introduce StorySage, a user-driven software system designed to meet the needs of a diverse group of users that supports a flexible conversation and a structured approach to autobiography writing. Powered by a multi-agent framework composed of an Interviewer, Session Scribe, Planner, Section Writer, and Session Coordinator, our system iteratively collects user memories, updates their autobiography, and plans for future conversations. In experimental simulations, StorySage demonstrates its ability to navigate multiple sessions and capture user memories across many conversations. User studies (N=28) highlight how StorySage maintains improved conversational flow, narrative completeness, and higher user satisfaction when compared to a baseline. In summary, StorySage contributes both a novel architecture for autobiography writing and insights into how multi-agent systems can enhance human-AI creative partnerships.</description>

      <title>Affective-CARA: A Knowledge Graph Driven Framework for Culturally Adaptive Emotional Intelligence in HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Culturally adaptive emotional responses remain a critical challenge in affective computing. This paper introduces Affective-CARA, an agentic framework designed to enhance user-agent interactions by integrating a Cultural Emotion Knowledge Graph (derived from StereoKG) with Valence, Arousal, and Dominance annotations, culture-specific data, and cross-cultural checks to minimize bias. A Gradient-Based Reward Policy Optimization mechanism further refines responses according to cultural alignment, affective appropriateness, and iterative user feedback. A Cultural-Aware Response Mediator coordinates knowledge retrieval, reinforcement learning updates, and historical data fusion. By merging real-time user input with past emotional states and cultural insights, Affective-CARA delivers narratives that are deeply personalized and sensitive to diverse cultural norms. Evaluations on AffectNet, SEMAINE DB, and MERD confirm that the framework consistently outperforms baseline models in sentiment alignment, cultural adaptation, and narrative quality. Affective-CARA achieved a Cultural Semantic Density of 9.32 out of 10 and lowered cultural representation bias by 61% (KL-Divergence: 0.28), demonstrating robust performance in generating ethical, adaptive responses. These findings suggest the potential for more inclusive and empathetic interactions, making Affective-CARA an avenue for fostering culturally grounded user experiences across domains such as cross-cultural communication, mental health support, and education.</description>

      <title>Balancing Caregiving and Self-Care: Exploring Mental Health Needs of Alzheimer's and Dementia Caregivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are progressive neurodegenerative conditions that impair memory, thought processes, and functioning. Family caregivers of individuals with AD/ADRD face significant mental health challenges due to long-term caregiving responsibilities. Yet, current support systems often overlook the evolving nature of their mental wellbeing needs. Our study examines caregivers' mental wellbeing concerns, focusing on the practices they adopt to manage the burden of caregiving and the technologies they use for support. Through semi-structured interviews with 25 family caregivers of individuals with AD/ADRD, we identified the key causes and effects of mental health challenges, and developed a temporal mapping of how caregivers' mental wellbeing evolves across three distinct stages of the caregiving journey. Additionally, our participants shared insights into improvements for existing mental health technologies, emphasizing the need for accessible, scalable, and personalized solutions that adapt to caregivers' changing needs over time. These findings offer a foundation for designing dynamic, stage-sensitive interventions that holistically support caregivers' mental wellbeing, benefiting both caregivers and care recipients.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Generative AI on Social Media: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly deployed across social media platforms, yet their implications for user behavior and experience remain understudied, particularly regarding two critical dimensions: (1) how AI tools affect the behaviors of content producers in a social media context, and (2) how content generated with AI assistance is perceived by users. To fill this gap, we conduct a controlled experiment with a representative sample of 680 U.S. participants in a realistic social media environment. The participants are randomly assigned to small discussion groups, each consisting of five individuals in one of five distinct experimental conditions: a control group and four treatment groups, each employing a unique AI intervention-chat assistance, conversation starters, feedback on comment drafts, and reply suggestions. Our findings highlight a complex duality: some AI-tools increase user engagement and volume of generated content, but at the same time decrease the perceived quality and authenticity of discussion, and introduce a negative spill-over effect on conversations. Based on our findings, we propose four design principles and recommendations aimed at social media platforms, policymakers, and stakeholders: ensuring transparent disclosure of AI-generated content, designing tools with user-focused personalization, incorporating context-sensitivity to account for both topic and user intent, and prioritizing intuitive user interfaces. These principles aim to guide an ethical and effective integration of generative AI into social media.</description>

      <title>System 0: Transforming Artificial Intelligence into a Cognitive Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces System 0, a conceptual framework for understanding how artificial intelligence functions as a cognitive extension preceding both intuitive (System 1) and deliberative (System 2) thinking processes. As AI systems increasingly shape the informational substrate upon which human cognition operates, they transform from passive tools into active cognitive partners. Building on the Extended Mind hypothesis and Heersmink's criteria for cognitive extension, we argue that AI systems satisfy key conditions for cognitive integration. These include reliability, trust, transparency, individualization, and the ability to enhance and transform human mental functions. However, AI integration creates a paradox: while expanding cognitive capabilities, it may simultaneously constrain thinking through sycophancy and bias amplification. To address these challenges, we propose seven evidence-based frameworks for effective human-AI cognitive integration: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding, which promotes progressive autonomy; Symbiotic Division of Cognitive Labor, strategically allocating tasks based on comparative strengths; Dialectical Cognitive Enhancement, countering AI sycophancy through productive epistemic tension; Agentic Transparency and Control, ensuring users understand and direct AI influence; Expertise Democratization, breaking down knowledge silos; Social-Emotional Augmentation, addressing affective dimensions of cognitive work; and Duration-Optimized Integration, managing the evolving human-AI relationship over time. Together, these frameworks provide a comprehensive approach for harnessing AI as a genuine cognitive extension while preserving human agency, critical thinking, and intellectual growth, transforming AI from a replacement for human cognition into a catalyst for enhanced thinking.</description>

      <title>MERba: Multi-Receptive Field MambaVision for Micro-Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal genuine emotions, holding significant potential in psychological diagnosis and criminal investigations. Despite notable advances in automatic ME recognition (MER), existing methods still struggle to jointly capture localized muscle activations and global facial dependencies, both critical for recognizing subtle emotional cues. To tackle this challenge, we propose MERba, a novel multi-receptive field architecture tailored for MER. MERba introduces a series of Local-Global Feature Integration stages, where fine-grained motion features are first extracted by local extractors containing MambaVision Mixers within non-overlapping windows, and then global dependencies across these regions are modeled via lightweight self-attention layers. This hierarchical design enables a progressive transition from localized perception to holistic facial understanding. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric multi-scanning strategy to eliminate redundant scanning directions and enhance local spatial perception. To address the high inter-class similarity among negative MEs, we introduce a Dual-Granularity Classification Module that decouples the recognition process into a coarse-to-fine paradigm. Experiments on two benchmark MER datasets demonstrate that MERba outperforms existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each proposed component.</description>

      <title>SimSpark: Interactive Simulation of Social Media Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding user behaviors on social media has garnered significant scholarly attention, enhancing our comprehension of how virtual platforms impact society and empowering decision-makers. Simulating social media behaviors provides a robust tool for capturing the patterns of social media behaviors, testing hypotheses, and predicting the effects of various interventions, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of social media environments. Moreover, it can overcome difficulties associated with utilizing real data for analysis, such as data accessibility issues, ethical concerns, and the complexity of processing large and heterogeneous datasets. However, researchers and stakeholders need more flexible platforms to investigate different user behaviors by simulating different scenarios and characters, which is not possible yet. Therefore, this paper introduces SimSpark, an interactive system including simulation algorithms and interactive visual interfaces which is capable of creating small simulated social media platforms with customizable characters and social environments. We address three key challenges: generating believable behaviors, validating simulation results, and supporting interactive control for generation and results analysis. A simulation workflow is introduced to generate believable behaviors of agents by utilizing large language models. A visual interface enables real-time parameter adjustment and process monitoring for customizing generation settings. A set of visualizations and interactions are also designed to display the models' outputs for further analysis. Effectiveness is evaluated through case studies, quantitative simulation model assessments, and expert interviews.</description>

      <title>Controlling Context: Generative AI at Work in Integrated Circuit Design and Other High-Precision Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI tools have become more prevalent in engineering workflows, particularly through chatbots and code assistants. As the perceived accuracy of these tools improves, questions arise about whether and how those who work in high-precision domains might maintain vigilance for errors, and what other aspects of using such tools might trouble their work. This paper analyzes interviews with hardware and software engineers, and their collaborators, who work in integrated circuit design to identify the role accuracy plays in their use of generative AI tools and what other forms of trouble they face in using such tools. The paper inventories these forms of trouble, which are then mapped to elements of generative AI systems, to conclude that controlling the context of interactions between engineers and the generative AI tools is one of the largest challenges they face. The paper concludes with recommendations for mitigating this form of trouble by increasing the ability to control context interactively.</description>

      <title>Exploring MLLMs Perception of Network Visualization Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we test whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can match human-subject performance in tasks involving the perception of properties in network layouts. Specifically, we replicate a human-subject experiment about perceiving quality (namely stress) in network layouts using GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5. Our experiments show that giving MLLMs exactly the same study information as trained human participants results in a similar performance to human experts and exceeds the performance of untrained non-experts. Additionally, we show that prompt engineering that deviates from the human-subject experiment can lead to better-than-human performance in some settings. Interestingly, like human subjects, the MLLMs seem to rely on visual proxies rather than computing the actual value of stress, indicating some sense or facsimile of perception. Explanations from the models provide descriptions similar to those used by the human participants (e.g., even distribution of nodes and uniform edge lengths).</description>

      <title>How Viable are Energy Savings in Smart Homes? A Call to Embrace Rebound Effects in Sustainable HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of global climate action, digital technologies are seen as a key enabler of energy efficiency savings. A popular application domain for this work is smart homes. There is a risk, however, that these efficiency gains result in rebound effects, which reduce or even overcompensate the savings. Rebound effects are well-established in economics, but it is less clear whether they also inform smart energy research in other disciplines. In this paper, we ask: to what extent have rebound effects and their underlying mechanisms been considered in computing, HCI and smart home research? To answer this, we conducted a literature mapping drawing on four scientific databases and a SIGCHI corpus. Our results reveal limited consideration of rebound effects and significant opportunities for HCI to advance this topic. We conclude with a taxonomy of actions for HCI to address rebound effects and help determine the viability of energy efficiency projects.</description>

      <title>StreetLens: Enabling Human-Centered AI Agents for Neighborhood Assessment from Street View Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, neighborhood studies have employed interviews, surveys, and manual image annotation guided by detailed protocols to identify environmental characteristics, including physical disorder, decay, street safety, and sociocultural symbols, and to examine their impact on developmental and health outcomes. While these methods yield rich insights, they are time-consuming and require intensive expert intervention. Recent technological advances, including vision-language models (VLMs), have begun to automate parts of this process; however, existing efforts are often ad hoc and lack adaptability across research designs and geographic contexts. In this demo paper, we present StreetLens, a human-centered, researcher-configurable workflow that embeds relevant social science expertise in a VLM for scalable neighborhood environmental assessments. StreetLens mimics the process of trained human coders by grounding the analysis in questions derived from established interview protocols, retrieving relevant street view imagery (SVI), and generating a wide spectrum of semantic annotations from objective features (e.g., the number of cars) to subjective perceptions (e.g., the sense of disorder in an image). By enabling researchers to define the VLM's role through domain-informed prompting, StreetLens places domain knowledge at the core of the analysis process. It also supports the integration of prior survey data to enhance robustness and expand the range of characteristics assessed across diverse settings. We provide a Google Colab notebook to make StreetLens accessible and extensible for researchers working with public or custom SVI datasets. StreetLens represents a shift toward flexible, agentic AI systems that work closely with researchers to accelerate and scale neighborhood studies.</description>

      <title>Design an Editable Speech-to-Sign-Language Transformer System: A Human-Centered AI Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a human-centered, real-time, user-adaptive speech-to-sign language animation system that integrates Transformer-based motion generation with a transparent, user-editable JSON intermediate layer. The framework overcomes key limitations in prior sign language technologies by enabling direct user inspection and modification of sign segments, thus enhancing naturalness, expressiveness, and user agency. Leveraging a streaming Conformer encoder and autoregressive Transformer-MDN decoder, the system synchronizes spoken input into upper-body and facial motion for 3D avatar rendering. Edits and user ratings feed into a human-in-the-loop optimization loop for continuous improvement. Experiments with 20 deaf signers and 5 interpreters show that the editable interface and participatory feedback significantly improve comprehension, naturalness, usability, and trust, while lowering cognitive load. With sub-20 ms per-frame inference on standard hardware, the system is ready for real-time communication and education. This work illustrates how technical and participatory innovation together enable accessible, explainable, and user-adaptive AI for sign language technology.</description>

      <title>How Warm-Glow Alters the Usability of Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As technology increasingly aligns with users' personal values, traditional models of usability, focused on functionality and specifically effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction, may not fully capture how people perceive and evaluate it. This study investigates how the warm-glow phenomenon, the positive feeling associated with doing good, shapes perceived usability. An experimental approach was taken in which participants evaluated a hypothetical technology under conditions designed to evoke either the intrinsic (i.e., personal fulfillment) or extrinsic (i.e., social recognition) dimensions of warm-glow. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance as well as subsequent follow-up analyses revealed that intrinsic warm-glow significantly enhances all dimensions of perceived usability, while extrinsic warm-glow selectively influences perceived effectiveness and satisfaction. These findings suggest that perceptions of usability extend beyond functionality and are shaped by how technology resonates with users' broader sense of purpose. We conclude by proposing that designers consider incorporating warm-glow into technology as a strategic design decision.</description>

      <title>Students' Reliance on AI in Higher Education: Identifying Contributing Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability and use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in educational settings has raised concerns about students' overreliance on these technologies. Overreliance occurs when individuals accept incorrect AI-generated recommendations, often without critical evaluation, leading to flawed problem solutions and undermining learning outcomes. This study investigates potential factors contributing to patterns of AI reliance among undergraduate students, examining not only overreliance but also appropriate reliance (correctly accepting helpful and rejecting harmful recommendations) and underreliance (incorrectly rejecting helpful recommendations). Our approach combined pre- and post-surveys with a controlled experimental task where participants solved programming problems with an AI assistant that provided both accurate and deliberately incorrect suggestions, allowing direct observation of students' reliance patterns when faced with varying AI reliability. We find that appropriate reliance is significantly related to students' programming self-efficacy, programming literacy, and need for cognition, while showing negative correlations with post-task trust and satisfaction. Overreliance showed significant correlations with post-task trust and satisfaction with the AI assistant. Underreliance was negatively correlated with programming literacy, programming self-efficacy, and need for cognition. Overall, the findings provide insights for developing targeted interventions that promote appropriate reliance on AI tools, with implications for the integration of AI in curriculum and educational technologies.</description>

      <title>TUM Teleoperation: Open Source Software for Remote Driving and Assistance of Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleoperation is a key enabler for future mobility, supporting Automated Vehicles in rare and complex scenarios beyond the capabilities of their automation. Despite ongoing research, no open source software currently combines Remote Driving, e.g., via steering wheel and pedals, Remote Assistance through high-level interaction with automated driving software modules, and integration with a real-world vehicle for practical testing. To address this gap, we present a modular, open source teleoperation software stack that can interact with an automated driving software, e.g., Autoware, enabling Remote Assistance and Remote Driving. The software featuresstandardized interfaces for seamless integration with various real-world and simulation platforms, while allowing for flexible design of the human-machine interface. The system is designed for modularity and ease of extension, serving as a foundation for collaborative development on individual software components as well as realistic testing and user studies. To demonstrate the applicability of our software, we evaluated the latency and performance of different vehicle platforms in simulation and real-world.

      <title>Multimodal Fusion with Semi-Supervised Learning Minimizes Annotation Quantity for Modeling Videoconference Conversation Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group conversations over videoconferencing are a complex social behavior. However, the subjective moments of negative experience, where the conversation loses fluidity or enjoyment remain understudied. These moments are infrequent in naturalistic data, and thus training a supervised learning (SL) model requires costly manual data annotation. We applied semi-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage targeted labeled and unlabeled clips for training multimodal (audio, facial, text) deep features to predict non-fluid or unenjoyable moments in holdout videoconference sessions. The modality-fused co-training SSL achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.9 and an F1 score of 0.6, outperforming SL models by up to 4% with the same amount of labeled data. Remarkably, the best SSL model with just 8% labeled data matched 96% of the SL model's full-data performance. This shows an annotation-efficient framework for modeling videoconference experience.</description>

      <title>An Interdisciplinary Review of Commonsense Reasoning and Intent Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores recent advances in commonsense reasoning and intent detection, two key challenges in natural language understanding. We analyze 28 papers from ACL, EMNLP, and CHI (2020-2025), organizing them by methodology and application. Commonsense reasoning is reviewed across zero-shot learning, cultural adaptation, structured evaluation, and interactive contexts. Intent detection is examined through open-set models, generative formulations, clustering, and human-centered systems. By bridging insights from NLP and HCI, we highlight emerging trends toward more adaptive, multilingual, and context-aware models, and identify key gaps in grounding, generalization, and benchmark design.</description>

      <title>ELI-Why: Evaluating the Pedagogical Utility of Language Model Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models today are widely used in education, yet their ability to tailor responses for learners with varied informational needs and knowledge backgrounds remains under-explored. To this end, we introduce ELI-Why, a benchmark of 13.4K "Why" questions to evaluate the pedagogical capabilities of language models. We then conduct two extensive human studies to assess the utility of language model-generated explanatory answers (explanations) on our benchmark, tailored to three distinct educational grades: elementary, high-school and graduate school. In our first study, human raters assume the role of an "educator" to assess model explanations' fit to different educational grades. We find that GPT-4-generated explanations match their intended educational background only 50% of the time, compared to 79% for lay human-curated explanations. In our second study, human raters assume the role of a learner to assess if an explanation fits their own informational needs. Across all educational backgrounds, users deemed GPT-4-generated explanations 20% less suited on average to their informational needs, when compared to explanations curated by lay people. Additionally, automated evaluation metrics reveal that explanations generated across different language model families for different informational needs remain indistinguishable in their grade-level, limiting their pedagogical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Public Acceptance of Cybernetic Avatars in the service sector: Evidence from a Large-Scale Survey in Dubai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cybernetic avatars are hybrid interaction robots or digital representations that combine autonomous capabilities with teleoperated control. This study investigates the acceptance of cybernetic avatars in the highly multicultural society of Dubai, with particular emphasis on robotic avatars for customer service. Specifically, we explore how acceptance varies as a function of robot appearance (e.g., android, robotic-looking, cartoonish), deployment settings (e.g., shopping malls, hotels, hospitals), and functional tasks (e.g., providing information, patrolling). To this end, we conducted a large-scale survey with over 1,000 participants. Overall, cybernetic avatars received a high level of acceptance, with physical robot avatars receiving higher acceptance than digital avatars. In terms of appearance, robot avatars with a highly anthropomorphic robotic appearance were the most accepted, followed by cartoonish designs and androids. Animal-like appearances received the lowest level of acceptance. Among the tasks, providing information and guidance was rated as the most valued. Shopping malls, airports, public transport stations, and museums were the settings with the highest acceptance, whereas healthcare-related spaces received lower levels of support. An analysis by community cluster revealed among others that Emirati respondents showed significantly greater acceptance of android appearances compared to the overall sample, while participants from the 'Other Asia' cluster were significantly more accepting of cartoonish appearances. Our study underscores the importance of incorporating citizen feedback into the design and deployment of cybernetic avatars from the early stages to enhance acceptance of this technology in society.</description>

      <title>Steering Robots with Inference-Time Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning has driven the development of generalist policies capable of autonomously solving multiple tasks. However, when a pretrained policy makes errors during deployment, there are limited mechanisms for users to correct its behavior. While collecting additional data for finetuning can address such issues, doing so for each downstream use case is inefficient at deployment. My research proposes an alternative: keeping pretrained policies frozen as a fixed skill repertoire while allowing user interactions to guide behavior generation toward user preferences at inference time. By making pretrained policies steerable, users can help correct policy errors when the model struggles to generalize-without needing to finetune the policy. Specifically, I propose (1) inference-time steering, which leverages user interactions to switch between discrete skills, and (2) task and motion imitation, which enables user interactions to edit continuous motions while satisfying task constraints defined by discrete symbolic plans. These frameworks correct misaligned policy predictions without requiring additional training, maximizing the utility of pretrained models while achieving inference-time user objectives.</description>

      <title>ELLIS Alicante at CQs-Gen 2025: Winning the critical thinking questions shared task: LLM-based question generation and selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of chat interfaces based on Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about promoting superficial learning and undermining the development of critical thinking skills. Instead of relying on LLMs purely for retrieving factual information, this work explores their potential to foster deeper reasoning by generating critical questions that challenge unsupported or vague claims in debate interventions. This study is part of a shared task of the 12th Workshop on Argument Mining, co-located with ACL 2025, focused on automatic critical question generation. We propose a two-step framework involving two small-scale open source language models: a Questioner that generates multiple candidate questions and a Judge that selects the most relevant ones. Our system ranked first in the shared task competition, demonstrating the potential of the proposed LLM-based approach to encourage critical engagement with argumentative texts.</description>

      <title>Gaze-informed Signatures of Trust and Collaboration in Human-Autonomy Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of human-autonomy teaming (HAT), fostering effective collaboration and trust between human and autonomous agents is increasingly important. To explore this, we used the game Overcooked AI to create dynamic teaming scenarios featuring varying agent behaviors (clumsy, rigid, adaptive) and environmental complexities (low, medium, high). Our objectives were to assess the performance of adaptive AI agents designed with hierarchical reinforcement learning for better teamwork and measure eye tracking signals related to changes in trust and collaboration. The results indicate that the adaptive agent was more effective in managing teaming and creating an equitable task distribution across environments compared to the other agents. Working with the adaptive agent resulted in better coordination, reduced collisions, more balanced task contributions, and higher trust ratings. Reduced gaze allocation, across all agents, was associated with higher trust levels, while blink count, scan path length, agent revisits and trust were predictive of the humans contribution to the team. Notably, fixation revisits on the agent increased with environmental complexity and decreased with agent versatility, offering a unique metric for measuring teammate performance monitoring. These findings underscore the importance of designing autonomous teammates that not only excel in task performance but also enhance teamwork by being more predictable and reducing the cognitive load on human team members. Additionally, this study highlights the potential of eye-tracking as an unobtrusive measure for evaluating and improving human-autonomy teams, suggesting eye gaze could be used by agents to dynamically adapt their behaviors.</description>

      <title>Why Interdisciplinary Teams Fail: A Systematic Analysis With Activity Theory in Clinical AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced AI technologies are increasingly integrated into clinical domains to advance patient care. The design and development of clinical AI technologies necessitate seamless collaboration between clinical and technical experts. Yet, such interdisciplinary teams are often unsuccessful, with a lack of systematic analysis of collaboration barriers and coping strategies. This work examines two clinical AI collaborations in the context of speech-language pathology via semi-structured interviews with six clinical and seven technical experts. Using Activity Theory (AT) as our analytical lens, we systematically investigate persistent knowledge gaps in mismatched data coding themes and specialized languages, and also highlight how clinical data can act as boundary objects and human knowledge brokers to alleviate these challenges. Our work underscores the benefits of leveraging analytical frameworks like AT to systematically examine interdisciplinary teams' collaborative work and provide meaningful insights on best practices in future collaboration.</description>

Abstract: Historically, scientific discovery has been a lengthy and costly process, demanding substantial time and resources from initial conception to final results. To accelerate scientific discovery, reduce research costs, and improve research quality, we introduce Agent Laboratory, an autonomous LLM-based framework capable of completing the entire research process. This framework accepts a human-provided research idea and progresses through three stages--literature review, experimentation, and report writing to produce comprehensive research outputs, including a code repository and a research report, while enabling users to provide feedback and guidance at each stage. We deploy Agent Laboratory with various state-of-the-art LLMs and invite multiple researchers to assess its quality by participating in a survey, providing human feedback to guide the research process, and then evaluate the final paper. We found that: (1) Agent Laboratory driven by o1-preview generates the best research outcomes; (2) The generated machine learning code is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods; (3) Human involvement, providing feedback at each stage, significantly improves the overall quality of research; (4) Agent Laboratory significantly reduces research expenses, achieving an 84% decrease compared to previous autonomous research methods. We hope Agent Laboratory enables researchers to allocate more effort toward creative ideation rather than low-level coding and writing, ultimately accelerating scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Bridging Voting and Deliberation with Algorithms: Field Insights from vTaiwan and Kultur Komitee</title>

Abstract: Democratic processes increasingly aim to integrate large-scale voting with face-to-face deliberation, addressing the challenge of reconciling individual preferences with collective decision-making. This work introduces new methods that use algorithms and computational tools to bridge online voting with face-to-face deliberation, tested in two real-world scenarios: Kultur Komitee 2024 (KK24) and vTaiwan. These case studies highlight the practical applications and impacts of the proposed methods.
  We present three key contributions: (1) Preference-based Clustering for Deliberation (PCD), which enables both in-depth and broad discussions in deliberative settings by computing homogeneous and heterogeneous group compositions with balanced and adjustable group sizes; (2) Human-in-the-loop MES, a practical method that enhances the Method of Equal Shares (MES) algorithm with real-time digital feedback. This builds algorithmic trust by giving participants full control over how much decision-making is delegated to the voting aggregation algorithm as compared to deliberation; and (3) the ReadTheRoom deliberation method, which uses opinion space mapping to identify agreement and divergence, along with spectrum-based preference visualisation to track opinion shifts during deliberation. This approach enhances transparency by clarifying collective sentiment and fosters collaboration by encouraging participants to engage constructively with differing perspectives. By introducing these actionable frameworks, this research extends in-person deliberation with scalable digital methods that address the complexities of modern decision-making in participatory processes.</description>

      <title>Carbon and Silicon, Coexist or Compete? A Survey on Human-AI Interactions in Agent-based Modeling and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest in human-AI interactions in agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) has grown rapidly due to the widespread utilization of large language models (LLMs). ABMS is an intelligent approach that simulates autonomous agents' behaviors within a defined environment to research emergent phenomena. Integrating LLMs into ABMS enables natural language interaction between humans and models. Meanwhile, it introduces new challenges that rely on human interaction to address. Human involvement can assist ABMS in adapting to flexible and complex research demands. However, systematic reviews of interactions that examine how humans and AI interact in ABMS are lacking. In this paper, we investigate existing works and propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the interactions derived from them. Specifically, human users refer to researchers who utilize ABMS tools to conduct their studies in our survey. We decompose interactions into five dimensions: the goals that users want to achieve (Why), the phases that users are involved (When), the components of the system (What), the roles of users (Who), and the means of interactions (How). Our analysis summarizes the findings that reveal existing interaction patterns. They provide researchers who develop interactions with comprehensive guidance on how humans and AI interact. We further discuss the unexplored interactions and suggest future research directions.</description>

      <title>The Rise of AI Companions: How Human-Chatbot Relationships Influence Well-Being</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs)-enhanced chatbots grow increasingly expressive and socially responsive, many users are beginning to form companionship-like bonds with them, particularly with simulated AI partners designed to mimic emotionally attuned interlocutors. These emerging AI companions raise critical questions: Can such systems fulfill social needs typically met by human relationships? How do they shape psychological well-being? And what new risks arise as users develop emotional ties to non-human agents? This study investigates how people interact with AI companions, especially simulated partners on CharacterAI, and how this use is associated with users' psychological well-being. We analyzed survey data from 1,131 users and 4,363 chat sessions (413,509 messages) donated by 244 participants, focusing on three dimensions of use: nature of the interaction, interaction intensity, and self-disclosure. By triangulating self-reports primary motivation, open-ended relationship descriptions, and annotated chat transcripts, we identify patterns in how users engage with AI companions and its associations with well-being. Findings suggest that people with smaller social networks are more likely to turn to chatbots for companionship, but that companionship-oriented chatbot usage is consistently associated with lower well-being, particularly when people use the chatbots more intensively, engage in higher levels of self-disclosure, and lack strong human social support. Even though some people turn to chatbots to fulfill social needs, these uses of chatbots do not fully substitute for human connection. As a result, the psychological benefits may be limited, and the relationship could pose risks for more socially isolated or emotionally vulnerable users.</description>

      <title>The Alternative Annotator Test for LLM-as-a-Judge: How to Statistically Justify Replacing Human Annotators with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The "LLM-as-an-annotator" and "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigms employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators, judges, and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure, the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test), that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM annotators and judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming the open-source LLMs we examine, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.</description>

      <title>From tools to thieves: Measuring and understanding public perceptions of AI through crowdsourced metaphors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How has the public responded to the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies? We investigate public perceptions of AI by collecting over 12,000 responses over 12 months from a nationally representative U.S. sample. Participants provided open-ended metaphors reflecting their mental models of AI, a methodology that overcomes the limitations of traditional self-reported measures by capturing more nuance. Using a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative clustering and qualitative coding, we identify 20 dominant metaphors shaping public understanding of AI. To analyze these metaphors systematically, we present a scalable framework integrating language modeling (LM)-based techniques to measure key dimensions of public perception: anthropomorphism (attribution of human-like qualities), warmth, and competence. We find that Americans generally view AI as warm and competent, and that over the past year, perceptions of AI's human-likeness and warmth have significantly increased ($+34\%, r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.01; +41\%, r = 0.62, p &lt; 0.05$). These implicit perceptions, along with the identified dominant metaphors, strongly predict trust in and willingness to adopt AI ($r^2 = 0.21, 0.18, p &lt; 0.001$). Moreover, we uncover systematic demographic differences in metaphors and implicit perceptions, such as the higher propensity of women, older individuals, and people of color to anthropomorphize AI, which shed light on demographic disparities in trust and adoption. In addition to our dataset and framework for tracking evolving public attitudes, we provide actionable insights on using metaphors for inclusive and responsible AI development.</description>

      <title>Scaling Computer-Use Grounding via User Interface Decomposition and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding, the ability to map natural language instructions to specific actions on graphical user interfaces, remains a critical bottleneck in computer use agent development. Current benchmarks oversimplify grounding tasks as short referring expressions, failing to capture the complexity of real-world interactions that require software commonsense, layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce OSWorld-G, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 564 finely annotated samples across diverse task types including text matching, element recognition, layout understanding, and precise manipulation. Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding dataset Jedi, which contains 4 million examples through multi-perspective decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its effectiveness by outperforming existing approaches on ScreenSpot-v2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved grounding with Jedi directly enhances agentic capabilities of general foundation models on complex computer tasks, improving from 5% to 27% on OSWorld. Through detailed ablation studies, we identify key factors contributing to grounding performance and verify that combining specialized data for different interface elements enables compositional generalization to novel interfaces. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced and available at https://osworld-grounding.github.io.</description>

      <title>AgentCPM-GUI: Building Mobile-Use Agents with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs), especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover, most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices. AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and $91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.</description>

      <title>Sharp Tools: How Developers Wield Agentic AI in Real Software Engineering Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the communication challenges that arise in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with participants solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. These results have implications for successful developer-agent collaborations, and for the design of more effective SWE agents.</description>
