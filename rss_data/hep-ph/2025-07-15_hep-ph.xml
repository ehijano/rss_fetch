      <title>Renormalization-group equations of the LEFT at two loops: dimension-six operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the third part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions for the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale (LEFT): insertions of dimension-six operators that conserve baryon number. In line with our previous publications, we obtain the results in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, corrected for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects through finite renormalizations. We compute the renormalization of the dimension-six four-fermion and three-gluon operators, as well as the power corrections to lower-dimension operators in the presence of masses, i.e., the down-mixing into dimension-five dipole operators, masses, gauge couplings, and theta terms. Our results are of interest for a broad range of low-energy precision searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Deciphering compressed electroweakino excesses with MadAnalysis 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present version 1.11 of MadAnalysis 5, which extends the software package in several major ways to improve the handling of efficiency tables, the computation of observables in different reference frames and the calculation of statistical limits and/or significance. We detail how these improvements, whose development was motivated by the desire to implement two Run 2 LHC analyses targeting signatures with soft leptons and missing energy and exhibiting mild excesses (ATLAS-SUSY-2018-16 and ATLAS-SUSY-2019-09), have been implemented by both direct extensions of the code and integrations with third-party software. We then document the implementation and validation of these analyses, demonstrating their utility along with the improved statistics capabilities of MadAnalysis 5 through an investigation of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in the context of a larger set of overlapping excesses in channels with soft leptons/jets and missing transverse energy.</description>

      <title>Out of the darkness: probing the inflationary era with dark photon dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent hint reported by the TASEH haloscope suggests the possible detection of dark photon dark matter with mass $19.5~{\rm \mu eV}$. Due to their production during inflation, dark photons act as unique messengers from this primordial epoch. We explore the implications that a confirmed detection would have in directly probing the inflationary era for the first time. To resolve the intrinsic degeneracy between the dark photon mixing parameter and its fractional relic abundance introduced by haloscope measurements, we motivate a next-generation light-shining-through-a-wall experiment. Combining these two experiences with cosmological data, particularly measurements of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to reconstruct dark photon properties. We delineate a coherent strategy for simultaneously determining the dark photon kinetic coupling, abundance, and properties of the inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Unveiling atomic electron motion effects in $e^+e^-$ high energy collisions at NA64</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic electron motion is responsible for well-studied effects observed in low-energy (MeV-scale) processes. Recently, interest in this phenomenon has also emerged within the high-energy physics community, due to its potential to increase significantly the center-of-mass energy in fixed-target experiments. However, direct experimental evidence of this effect in high energy collisions has yet to be observed. We argue that a striking manifestation of atomic electron momenta could be revealed by the NA64 experiment at CERN during the proposed run with a 40 GeV positron beam. At this energy, $\mu^+\mu^-$ production via positron annihilation on electrons at rest is kinematically forbidden. The detection of $\mu^+\mu^-$ pairs from the annihilation channel would thus constitute direct evidence of an increase in the center-of-mass energy resulting from atomic electron motion. We also investigate the expected signatures for the proposed 60 GeV run, as well as for the data already collected at 70 GeV. Intriguingly, in both these cases, the predicted number of $\mu^+\mu^-$ pairs from positron annihilation is reduced compared to the electron-at-rest approximation.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of hot dense QCD Matter from a refined holographic EMD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we begin by delineating the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model within the holographic QCD framework and deriving the equation of state through holographic renormalization. Subsequently, we utilize the Wald method to determine the first law of thermodynamics for a five-dimensional black hole, thereby confirming the alignment of our EMD model with the thermodynamics of the grand canonical ensemble in the boundary field theory. By employing the $n-2$ form in the Wald method, we proceed to calculate the shear viscosity in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The results we obtain demonstrate consistency with those from first-order metric perturbation. Furthermore, we construct a refined EMD model that attains quantitative agreement with the lattice QCD equation of state and baryon number susceptibility data at finite density. Using this enhanced model, we delve into the investigation of signals related to the QCD phase transition critical endpoint. At present, no non-monotonic changes in $\kappa\sigma^2$ have been observed within the 7$\sim$200 GeV collision energy range at STAR. However, our theoretical analysis suggests that if the chemical freeze-out line does not intersect the first-order phase transition line, a peak-like structure in $\kappa\sigma^2$ is anticipated within the 3$\sim$5 GeV range.</description>

      <title>Production mechanism of doubly charmed exotic mesons $T_{cc}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09191v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production mechanism for doubly charmed tetraquark mesons within a coupled-channel formalism. The two-body Feynman kernel amplitudes are constructed using effective Lagrangians that respect heavy quark symmetry, chiral symmetry, SU(3) flavor symmetry, and hidden local symmetry. The fully off-shell coupled scattering equations are solved within the Blankenbecler-Sugar (BbS) reduction scheme. We find three positive-parity and one negative-parity tetraquark states with total spin $J=1$. Among them, two positive-parity states appear as bound states in the isoscalar and isovector $DD^*$ channels, while another appears as a resonance in the $D^*D^*$ channel. A negative-parity resonance is also predicted in the isoscalar channel. We analyze the coupling strengths of these tetraquark states to various channels. The dependence of the results on the reduced cutoff mass $\Lambda_0$ is examined. The most significant tetraquark state remains stable within the range of $\Lambda_0=(600-700)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of dark-photon haloscope sensitivity with degenerate modes: toward axion-level form factor and polarization determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark photon has been postulated as a potential constituent of dark matter, exhibiting notable similarities to the axion. The primary distinction between the two particles lies in the nature of their respective fields: the dark photon field is a vector field with a polarization direction that remains undetermined. This work explores the prospect of utilizing three degenerate modes for scanning the three dimensions of space in order to mitigate the low form factor expected in the detection of the dark photon due to their unknown polarization. The employment of an haloscope with three orthogonal and degenerate modes in conjunction with the coherent sum of signals is demonstrated in this work in order to enhance the dark photon form factor up to the axion form factor, and to determine the direction of the dark photon polarization vector. We show in this manuscript that the maximum form factor is achieved in cavities of cubic, spherical, and cylindrical geometries, considering the introduction of tuning elements. To achieve this adequately, some conditions reviewed in this article must be fulfilled in the resonant cavity, leading to uncertainties in the final measurement. Finally, this technique can allow the simultaneous search for dark matter axions and dark photons, and to the knowledge of the authors, the method shown in this work is the most effective one for detecting dark photon with microwave resonant cavities.</description>

      <title>The Muon Magnetic Moment and Physics Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the role of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon a_\mu as a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), taking advantage of the final result of the Fermilab g-2 experiment and the recently updated Standard Model value. This review provides both a comprehensive summary of the current status, as well as an accessible entry point for phenomenologists with interests in dark matter, Higgs and electroweak or neutrino and flavour physics in the context of a wide range of BSM scenarios. It begins with a qualitative overview of the field and a collection of key properties and typical results. It then focuses on model-independent, generic formulas and classifies types of BSM scenarios with or without chiral enhancements. A strong emphasis of the review are the connections to a large number of other observables -- ranging from the muon mass and the muon--Higgs coupling and related dipole observables to dark matter, neutrino masses and high-energy collider observables. Finally, we survey a number of well-motivated BSM scenarios such as dark photons, axion-like particles, the two-Higgs doublet model, supersymmetric models and models with leptoquarks, vector-like leptons or neutrino mass models. We discuss the impact of the updated Standard Model value for a_\mu and of complementary constraints, exploring the phenomenology and identifying excluded and viable parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Investigating QCD Dynamical Entropy in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the concept of QCD dynamical entropy is extended to heavy ion systems. This notion of entropy can be understood as a relative entropy and can also be used to estimate the initial entropy density in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The key quantity used to calculate this entropy is the nuclear unintegrated gluon distribution (nUGD), which provides a transverse momentum probability density. In the numerical analysis, both the geometric scaling phenomenon and the Glauber-Gribov approach have been used to evaluate realistic models for the nUGD. It is shown that the normalization procedure and the geometric scaling property make the dynamical entropy almost independent of the nucleus mass number $A$. Results are presented for the dynamical entropy density, $dS_D/dy$, in terms of the rapidity.</description>

      <title>Rare Higgs Decay into a Photon and a Z Boson in Radiatively-Driven Natural Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the rare decay process in which a Higgs boson decays into a $Z$ boson and a photon. In the first part of the paper, we analyze the Standard Model (SM) contributions to the corresponding decay width, including the full leading-order result, two-loop $O(\alpha_s)$ QCD corrections, and the recently reported two-loop $O(\alpha)$ electroweak corrections, evaluated under four different $\alpha$ renormalization schemes. The dependence on the Higgs boson mass is studied within the experimentally allowed range reported by the LHC. In the considered schemes, a non-negligible variation of about $4\%$ is found when the mass is varied within its current experimental uncertainty. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the leading-order contributions to the same process within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The spectrum of soft SUSY-breaking parameters and SUSY particle masses at the electroweak scale, which enter the computation of the one-loop amplitudes contributing to the decay width, is obtained by evolving the GUT-scale parameters of a Radiatively-Driven Natural Supersymmetry (RNS) model with non-universal Higgs boson masses. Variations of the RNS parameters can enhance the average SM prediction by up to $\sim20\%$, reaching a value of $\sim7.5~$keV, while still satisfying the Higgs boson mass constraint. However, this comes at the cost of allowing a moderately large fine-tuning parameter, with values exceeding $100$, thereby placing the model outside its most natural parameter region. The predicted decay width in the RNS scenario is closer to the recent ATLAS RUN 2 + 3 combined measurement than the SM expectation.</description>

      <title>KLOE-MAMI $\eta\!\to\!\pi^{0}\gamma\gamma$ Puzzle Solution via Nucleon-Rescaled Leptophobic Vector from Scalar Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent KLOE measurement $\mathrm{BR}^{\eta\rightarrow\pi^{0}\gamma\gamma}_{\text{KLOE}} = (0.98\pm0.11_{\text{stat}}\pm0.14_{\text{syst}})\times10^{-4}$ is less than half the current world average, $(2.55\pm0.22)\times10^{-4}$, which is dominated by MAMI photoproduction data. We show that this $\approx 5.5\, \sigma$ discrepancy can be resolved by the presence of a new leptophobic vector particle $V_{\mathcal B}$ with $2\ \text{GeV}\lesssim m_{V_{\!\mathcal B}} \lesssim 5\ \text{GeV}$, whose couplings arise through the \rm{GeV}-scale scalar portal. Integrating out the scalar generates the contact operator $\bigl(\bar N N\bigr)\,\widetilde V_{\mathcal{B}}^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}P$ that modifies the $\eta^{(\prime)}\!\to\!\pi^{0}\left(\eta\right)\gamma\gamma$ decay rate only in the processes involving an external nucleon current ($\gamma p\!\to\!\eta^{(\prime)}p$, $\pi^-p\!\to\!\eta^{(\prime)}n$), but leaves purely leptonic production channels, such as $\phi\to\eta\gamma$ at KLOE and $J/\psi\to\gamma\eta$ at BESIII, Standard-Model-like. The same mechanism predicts a $\approx 10\%$ nucleon-triggered enhancement of the $\eta'\!\to\!\pi^{0}\gamma\gamma$ decay rate and a negligible shift for $\eta'\!\to\!\eta\gamma\gamma$, together with an $\rm{A}^{2}$-scaling boost if photoproduction is performed on heavy nuclei instead of protons. An integrated experimental programme that compares $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \eta(\pi^{0}) \gamma\gamma$ decays in the presence of nucleon currents, as opposed to purely leptonic production channels, searches for a narrow nucleon-philic vector in the $2\!-\!5\,\mathrm{GeV}$ mass range, and probes scalar portals above $1\,\mathrm{GeV}$, can decisively confirm or exclude our nucleon-rescaled, leptophobic-vector explanation of the KLOE-MAMI discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Off-shell modifications of the pion generalized parton distributions and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The off-shell characteristics of pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) are examined within the framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. In our previous papers, we separately investigated the properties of on-shell pion GPDs and light-front wave functions. It is particularly intriguing to compare the differences between on-shell and off-shell pion GPDs, which allows us to explore the effects associated with off-shellness. Due to the absence of crossing symmetry, the moments of GPDs also incorporate odd powers of the skewness parameter, resulting in new off-shell form factors. Through our calculations, we derived correction functions that account for modifications in pion GPDs due to off-shell effects. Unlike their on-shell counterparts, certain properties break down in the off-shell scenario; for instance, symmetry properties and polynomiality conditions may no longer hold. Additionally, we evaluate off-shell TMDs and compare them with their on-shell equivalents while also investigating their dependence on $\bm{k}_{\perp}$.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Unbinned Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unfolding, in the context of high-energy particle physics, refers to the process of removing detector distortions in experimental data. The resulting unfolded measurements are straightforward to use for direct comparisons between experiments and a wide variety of theoretical predictions. For decades, popular unfolding strategies were designed to operate on data formatted as one or more binned histograms. In recent years, new strategies have emerged that use machine learning to unfold datasets in an unbinned manner, allowing for higher-dimensional analyses and more flexibility for current and future users of the unfolded data. This guide comprises recommendations and practical considerations from researchers across a number of major particle physics experiments who have recently put these techniques into practice on real data.</description>

      <title>The First Constraint on the Dark Matter Millicharge via Multimessenger Time-Delay Analysis of GRB GW170817A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new constraint on millicharged dark matter from the multimessenger observation of GW170817. In the neutron star merger event GW170817, the first detection of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) delayed by approximately 1.7 seconds relative to the gravitational wave emission was observed. Utilizing this delay, we constrain the millicharge parameter of dark matter within the large-scale structure of the Universe. {For dark matter mass below $10^{-15}$ eV, the millicharge parameter $\epsilon$ is constrained to be less than $10^{-14}$, representing the most stringent limits achieved to date.</description>

      <title>Chiral and flavor oscillations in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive fermions produced through weak charged interactions possess a definite chirality, which is not conserved during free propagation, leading to chiral oscillations. Neutrinos also exhibit flavor oscillations. These phenomena have been extensively studied - both individually and within a unified framework - using the first quantization approach, but only separately in the context of quantum field theory. In this work, we address this gap by developing a quantum field theory treatment of flavor-chiral oscillations. Focusing on the case of two-flavor mixing, we compute the expectation values of the (non-conserved) chiral-flavor charges and recover the same oscillation formulas obtained in the first quantization formalism. These charges are diagonalized via Bogoliubov transformations in both the chiral and flavor sectors. Such transformations reveal a non-trivial structure of the chiral-flavor vacuum, which consists of a condensate of particles with definite masses and helicities.</description>

      <title>Probing Right Handed Neutrino assisted Reheating with Gravitational Waves and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a non-instantaneous reheating period in the early Universe, where the inflaton field decays exclusively to right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of these RHNs into Standard Model particles not only drives the transition to a radiation-dominated era but also generates the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. In this typical reheating scenario, gravitational waves (GWs) can be produced during inflaton decay, both through bremsstrahlung and inflaton scattering processes. While GW production via bremsstrahlung dominates near the end of the reheating phase, inflaton scattering leads to a non-negligible GW contribution near the maximum temperature of the Universe. The combined GW spectrum from both decay and scattering processes lies within the sensitivity range of proposed resonant cavity experiments. This framework thus offers a compelling and unified approach to addressing neutrino mass generation, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis, and probing the dynamics of a non-instantaneous reheating era.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks: The TQ4Q1.1 functions as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of exotic matter formation via the {\tt TQ4Q1.1} set of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for fully charmed or bottomed tetraquarks in three quantum configurations: scalar ($J^{PC} = 0^{++}$), axial vector ($J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$), and tensor ($J^{PC} = 2^{++}$). We adopt single-parton fragmentation at leading power and implement a nonrelativistic QCD factorization scheme tailored to tetraquark Fock-state configurations. Short-distance inputs at the initial scale are modeled using updated calculations for both gluon- and heavy-quark-initiated channels. A threshold-consistent DGLAP evolution is then applied via HFNRevo. We provide the first systematic treatment of uncertainties propagated from the color-composite long-distance matrix elements that govern the nonperturbative hadronization of tetraquarks. To support phenomenology, we compute NLL/NLO$^+$ cross sections for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC using (sym)JETHAD, incorporating angular multiplicities as key observables sensitive to high-energy QCD dynamics. This work connects the investigation of exotic hadrons with state-of-the-art precision QCD.</description>

      <title>Structure of lightest nuclei in the visible Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplest atomic nucleus, deuteron, provides key insights into the strong nuclear interactions among quarks and gluons that shape the visible universe. We present the first attempt to calculate the internal structure of the deuteron by incorporating hidden-color degrees of freedom, modeling it as an effective mixture of singlet-singlet and octet-octet color clusters beyond the traditional proton-neutron picture. By employing the separation of variables for the light-front two-cluster bound-state equation, we explore how these hidden color correlations shape both its spin and electromagnetic structure. We incorporate the transverse and longitudinal dynamics by two Schr\"odinger-like equations, namely the light-front holography and the 't Hooft equation, respectively. Our predictions of the electromagnetic form factors and structure functions, including tensor-polarized function, align well with experimental data, offering insights into the partonic structure of the deuteron. Its tensor property could pave the way for a new era in spin physics, guiding future experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Triply heavy baryon spectroscopy revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of triply heavy baryons ($\Omega_{ccc}$, $\Omega_{bbb}$, $\Omega_{bcc}$, and $\Omega_{bbc}$) within the nonrelativistic quark model, employing the Gaussian expansion method to calculate mass spectra up to $D$-wave states. Our analysis represents the most complete treatment to date for this model, incorporating full angular momentum mixing effects. While our predictions for low-lying states agree well with lattice QCD results, we find systematically lower masses for excited states compared to lattice calculations. Using the obtained wave functions, we estimate radiative decay widths up to $1D$ states, revealing significant differences from previous theoretical work. Additionally, we identify and resolve several misconceptions in prior treatments of triply heavy baryon spectroscopy, particularly symmetry constraint and wave function construction in three-quark systems. These results provide crucial information for future experimental searches and theoretical investigations of triply heavy baryon systems.</description>

      <title>Two loops, four tops and two $\gamma_5$ schemes: a renormalization story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the four-top quark operator contributions to the two-loop renormalization constants of the fermion and gluon fields, necessary to obtain the renormalization group equations for the fermion masses and the strong coupling constant. The computation has been carried out in the na\"{\i}ve dimensional regularization scheme for the $\gamma_5$ matrix. We also discuss a strategy to translate the results into the Breitenlohner--Maison--'t~Hooft--Veltman scheme and present the corresponding beta functions in both schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, the scotogenic model is constructed applying non invertible $Z_M$ symmetries. The stability of dark matter and the scotogenic structure of the neutrino mass matrix is achieved via the new non-group symmetry. The non-group Scotogenic model is given with minimalistic content giving a one-zero structure of the neutrino mass matrix, and numerical analysis of the lepton mixing angles and physics are presented. Other relevant constraints are also studied.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Monte Carlo calculation of compact $T_{cs0}$ and $T_{c\bar{s}0}$ tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHCb collaboration amplitude analysis of the decays $B^+ \to D^+ D^- K^+$, $B^+ \to D^- D_s^+ \pi^+$, and $B^0 \to \bar{D}^0 D_s^+ \pi^-$ suggested the existence of two new resonant $J^P=0^+$ states with minimum quark content $\bar{u} \bar{d} s c$ and $\bar{s} \bar{u} d c$/$\bar{s} \bar{d} u c$, named $T_{cs0}$ and $T_{c\bar{s}0}$, respectively. In this work, we used the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method to compute the masses of those tetraquarks within the framework of the constituent quark model. We describe the systems as compact structures, not as diquark/antidiquark or meson/meson arrangements. This allows us to deduce the existence of two distinct bound configurations for each composition, corresponding to ground and excited flavor states. In both cases, the excited flavor states are the ones with masses comparable to the ones observed by LHCb. In addition, our analysis allows us to assign unambiguously an isospin value of $I$=1 to the experimentally obtained $T_{cs0}$ tetraquark</description>

      <title>Quark model of nucleon based on an analogy with polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the polaron theory from solid state physics can serve as an interesting analogue model for non-perturbative QCD, at least in the description of nucleons and related low-energy physics of strong interactions. By drawing explicit analogies between polaron physics, arising for an electron moving in an ionic crystal, and physics of pion-nucleon interactions, certain rules for the "polaron/QCD correspondence" are proposed. In polaron theory, the effective fermion mass as a function of the coupling constant is known both in the weak and strong coupling limits. The conjectured "polaron/QCD correspondence" translates these results into strong interactions. It is then shown how application of these rules leads to unexpectedly good quantitative predictions for the nucleon mass and the pion-nucleon sigma term. The polaron approach also predicts that the quark degrees of freedom in the form of the constituent quark account for one-third of the nucleon mass, consistent with lattice predictions. We discuss possible physical reasons underlying the observed quantitative similarity between polaron physics and non-perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Waterfall phase in supersymmetric hybrid inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a class of realistic supersymmetric hybrid inflation models with a predicted scalar spectral index $n_s \approx 0.97-0.978$, which is in good agreement with the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) measurement. The waterfall field responsible for the gauge symmetry breaking in this scenario experiences some $e$-foldings during the inflationary epoch. The scalar perturbations associated with the waterfall field during this phase induce a stochastic gravitational wave spectrum that will be tested in the ongoing Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements and in future experiments. In an $SU(5)$ setting an observable number density of the superheavy GUT monopole linked to the waterfall field can be realized.</description>

      <title>Generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach to the thermodynamics of quark-hadron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to the transition from hadronic matter to quark matter where hadrons are treated as bound states of quarks which dissociate at high densities due to quark Pauli blocking. The newly developed approach makes use of a cluster virial expansion formulated in terms of a generalized $\Phi$-derivable approach to multi-quark correlations with bound and continuum states in their spectrum encoded in hadron phase shifts. Our model can be used to obtain thermodynamic functions not only at zero and small chemical potentials, where they are consistent with lattice QCD simulations, but also at large chemical potentials where lattice QCD simulations have the sign problem. By applying a reaction-kinetic criterion for the chemical freeze-out of multi-quark clusters in heavy-ion collisions, we demonstrate that the chemical freeze-out coincides with their Mott transition. The approach can be applied to study the effects of the QCD transition on primordial black hole formation in the early Universe and on hybrid neutron star formation in supernova explosions and binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Odd-Parity $s$-wave $\Xi^*$ States in Femtoscopic Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $\Xi^*$ resonances within the molecular picture, where these states are dynamically generated as poles in the unitarized scattering amplitudes arising from the coupled-channel interactions of $K^{*-} \Lambda$, $K^{*-} \Sigma^0$, $\rho^- \Xi^0$, $\overline{K}{}^{*0} \Sigma^-$, $\rho^0 \Xi^-$, $\omega \Xi^-$, and $\phi \Xi^-$. The interaction kernel is derived from the local hidden gauge formalism, while the unitarization procedure employs a hybrid method that combines cutoff and dimensional regularizations in the evaluation of the loop function. From a detailed spectroscopic analysis, we identify two $S = -2$ baryon states whose properties are compatible with some of the $\Xi^*$ resonances listed in the Review of Particle Physics. To explore their possible experimental signatures, we compute the femtoscopic correlation functions for all the vector-baryon pairs considered in the present study, using realistic estimates of production weights and varying source sizes $R = 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5$ fm.</description>

      <title>Novel and Updated Bounds on Flavor-Violating Z Interactions in the Quark Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive bounds on the flavor-violating (FV) couplings of the $Z$ boson to quarks and present future sensitivity projections. Our analysis shows that the current bounds on the FV couplings are $\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$ for the $Z$ couplings to $cu$ and $sd$, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ for $bd$, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ for $bs$, and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ for $tu$ and $tc$. Overall, low-energy flavor experiments provide significantly stronger constraints on these FV couplings than current collider searches.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the spread of nuclear masses in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays based on the Phase I hybrid data from the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the correlation between the depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles and the signal in water-Cherenkov stations in events registered simultaneously by the fluorescence and surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The analysis enables us to place constraints on the spread of nuclear masses in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with a minor impact from the experimental systematic uncertainties and uncertainties in air-shower simulations. Due to this unique feature, the correlation analysis has previously allowed us to exclude all pure and proton-helium compositions near the ankle in the cosmic-ray energy spectrum at 5$\sigma$ confidence level. The same property makes the correlation analysis an effective tool for testing the consistency of predictions of the post-LHC hadronic interaction models, including their latest versions such as EPOS LHC-R, QGSJet-III-01, Sibyll${}^\bigstar$ and Sibyll 2.3e. In this work, the correlation analysis using the Phase I hybrid data from the Pierre Auger Observatory is presented. The analysis uses the newest generation of hadronic interaction models and covers an extended energy range around the ankle in the cosmic-ray spectrum.</description>

      <title>Muon Signal Charge in the Underground Muon Detector of AugerPrime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Underground Muon Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory features a calorimetric detection mode that estimates the number of muons based on signal charge measurements. This contribution provides an overview of the calibration procedure, revisiting the previously published strategy and identifying a bias introduced by the triggers used to estimate the mean charge deposited by a vertical muon. We demonstrate that calibrating underground detectors requires careful consideration of the interactions of penetrating particles through matter. In devices based on plastic scintillators, energy deposition, and thus the recorded charge, is significantly affected by knock-on electron production in the surrounding ground as muons traverse the medium. To mitigate this effect, we propose a new calibration strategy that ensures an unbiased muon estimator. This approach is applied to data collected from 2019 to 2024.</description>

Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of antennas to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to detect them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Three prototype GRAND radio arrays have been in operation since 2023: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the GRAND detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a first look at data collected by GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger, including the first cosmic-ray candidates detected by them.</description>

      <title>Novel Challenges in Tracking Self-Interacting Dark Matter Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time. In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations. These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.</description>

      <title>Update on testing of air-shower modelling using combined data of the Pierre Auger Observatory and phenomenological consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combined data of Fluorescence and Surface Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory has recently provided the strongest constraints on the validity of predictions from current models of hadronic interactions. The unmodified predictions of these models on the depth of shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$) and the hadronic part of the ground signal are unable to accurately describe the measured data at a level of more than 5$\sigma$ in the energy range 3-10 EeV. This inconsistency has been shown to originate not only from the predicted amount of muons at the ground level, but also from the predicted scale of $X_\text{max}$, which must be adjusted to better match the observed data. The resulting deeper $X_\text{max}$ scales of the models imply a heavier mass composition to be interpreted from the $X_\text{max}$ measurements. We show the results of the test with an updated data set of the Pierre Auger Observatory, studying also the energy evolution of the fitted modification parameters and new versions of the models of hadronic interactions. Additionally, we discuss the phenomenological consequences of the deeper $X_\text{max}$ scale of models on the interpretation of the features of the energy spectrum and the muon problem in air-shower modelling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking as a model the fact that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics was derived from Hamiltonian mechanics using the correspondence principle, we explore a class of dynamical systems involving discrete variables, with Nambu mechanics as the starting point. Specifically, we reconstruct an extended version of matrix mechanics that describes dynamical systems possessing physical quantities expressed through generalized matrices. Furthermore, we reconfirm that a multiple commutator involving generalized matrices can serve as a discrete (quantized) version of the Nambu bracket or the Jacobian.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal relation of Schwinger pair production between $\textrm{dS}_2$ and $\textrm{AdS}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equation for a massive charged field in a uniform electric field has a symmetry of two-dimensional global de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In the in-out formalism the mean numbers of spinors (spin-1/2 fermions) and scalars (spin-0 bosons) spontaneously produced by the uniform electric field are exactly found from the Bogoliubov relations both in the global and planar coordinates of (A)dS$_2$ space. We show that the uniform electric field enhances the production of charged spinor and scalar pairs in the planar and global dS space while the AdS space reduces the pair production in which weak electric fields below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound prohibits pair production. The leading Boltzmann factor in dS space can be written as the Gibbons-Hawking radiation or Schwinger effect with e-folding factors less than one that give the QED effect or the curvature effect. We observe that dS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ spaces are connected by QED, such as a reciprocal relation between the mean number of spinors and scalars provided that the spacetime curvature is analytically continued. The leading behavior of the mean numbers for spinors and scalars is explained as a sum of contour integrals of the frequency in the phase-integral formulation.</description>

      <title>Decoding Two-Particle States in QCD with Spatial Wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic way to constructing optimized interpolating operators strongly coupled to QCD two-particle states is developed, which is achieved by incorporating inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions. To efficiently implement these operators in lattice QCD, a novel quark smearing technique utilizing noise vectors is proposed. Applied to the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ system, the optimized operators resolve distinct eigenstates separated by only $\sim 5$ MeV near the threshold $2m_{\Omega_{ccc}} \simeq 9700$ MeV. This exceptional resolving power opens new possibilities for studies of a wide range of hadronic systems in QCD.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction-based operator optimization for two-hadron systems in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic way to constructing optimized interpolating operators for two-hadron systems is developed by incorporating inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions. The wavefunctions can be obtained from an iterative process with an appropriate initial guess. To implement these operators, a novel quark smearing technique utilizing $Z_3$ noise vectors is proposed, which allows for effectively incorporating inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions at the source without using all-to-all quark propagators. Proof-of-principle application to the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ system using physical-point lattice configurations with a large size $La\simeq8.1$~fm shows that optimized operators enables clear identification of states around $2m_{\Omega_{ccc}}\simeq 9700$ MeV with the energy gap as narrow as $\sim 5$ MeV. A comparison on correlation functions, effective energies, and HAL QCD potentials between unoptimized operators and optimized operators is given, with a special emphasis on the effects from nearby elastic scattering states. Potential applicability of the optimized operator to various two-hadron systems and its relation to the variational method are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Study of the $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ semileptonic decay in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $\Lambda \to N$ vector and axial-vector form factors, which are essential inputs for studying the semileptonic decay $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$. This channel provides a clean, theoretically controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element $|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector. Our analysis uses a gauge ensemble with physical light, strange, and charm quark masses and yields the most precise determination to date of the full set of transition form factors -- including second-class contributions -- as well as the associated couplings, radii, and the ratio of muon-to-electron decay rates, an observable sensitive to possible non-standard scalar and tensor interactions. We compare our non-perturbative results with next-to-next-to-leading order expansions in the small parameter $\delta = (m_\Lambda - m_N)/m_\Lambda \approx 0.16$. We find that the common phenomenological approximation of neglecting the $q^2$-dependence of the form factors leads to a $\sim 4\%$ deviation in the decay rate. This underscores the critical importance of precise, fully non-perturbative form factor inputs for achieving the sub-percent precision targets of upcoming experimental programs.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Background as a Probe of the Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of relativistic corrections for the study of the stability of $(2+1)$-dimensional non-topological solitons with quartic self-interaction in the low-energy limit. This result is explained by the restoration of conformal symmetry in the non-relativistic limit. Particularly, the corresponding cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation supports scale-free non-topological solitons. An unbroken conformal symmetry provides the additional degeneration that allows for the exact result for the energy and angular momentum of the stationary classical solutions. We study the violation of conformal symmetry by relativistic corrections. The emergence of exponentially growing modes on the classical background is demonstrated using analytical approximations and numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Joint Multiband Detection of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes by LGWA and the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band, making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs. We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers. Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$. The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.</description>

      <title>The multiplicity distributions of the high frequency gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the gravitons are created thanks to the variation of the space-time curvature the multiplicity distributions quantify the probability of producing a given number of species around the average occupation numbers of the underlying multiparticle states. The multiplicities of the relic gravitons are infinitely divisible and their analytical expressions encompass, in different regions of the physical parameters, the Poisson, Bose-Einstein, Gamma and Pascal probability distributions. Depending upon the post-inflationary timelines, the averaged multiplicities are controlled by the range of the comoving frequencies and they can be much larger in the GHz region than in the aHz domain where the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the microwave background set strict limits on the spectral energy density of the relic gravitons. Thanks to the absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency of the gravitons we can acknowledge that the averaged multiplicities are exponentially suppressed above the THz, where only few pairs of gravitons are independently created from the vacuum. The statistical properties of the produced particles can be finally interpreted in the light of the second-order interference effects and this perspective is quantitatively scrutinized by analyzing the associated quantum sensitivities. For putative instruments reaching spectral amplitudes ${\mathcal O}(10^{-35})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the MHz or GHz bands, the Bose-Einstein correlations could be used to probe the properties of cosmic gravitons and their super-Poissonian statistics. Both from the theoretical and observational viewpoint it is unjustified to require the same sensitivities (e.g. ${\mathcal O}(10^{-21})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$) in the kHz and GHz domains.</description>

      <title>Data production and Monte Carlo simulations for the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory consists of 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) and 27 fluorescence telescopes, covering a surface of 3000 km2 in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. After almost two decades, Auger Phase I has ended the data taking and has already delivered many outstanding physics results. The Auger Observatory is currently running in Phase II, with upgraded detectors for enhanced data of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). During Phase I, several engineering detectors were developed and tested. Some of those developments led to new detectors, which are now part of the upgraded Observatory. For Phase II, the WCDs were upgraded with a surface-scintillator detector, a radio detector, a small photomultiplier, and an upgraded electronics board, facilitating mass-sensitive measurements for source identification of UHECRs. Moreover, an underground muon detector allows for a direct measurement of the muon content of air showers. The Offline framework is the main software for the event reconstruction and detector simulation at the Pierre Auger Observatory. It is continuously being developed to accommodate changes in the detector and new algorithms. It allows the running of various applications, which are made up of individual modules, either on raw data or simulations on an event-by-event basis. Large productions of shower and detector reference libraries are done with CORSIKA 7 and Offline on the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) using the Virtual Organization Auger. Various air-shower geometries (up to 89 degrees in zenith) were considered, as well as several primary particles (from light to ultra-heavy nuclei, photons, and neutrinos), hadronic interaction models and detector configurations for Phase I and Phase II. In this contribution, we present the actual efforts and updates on software for data production and reference Monte Carlo simulations for Auger data analysis.</description>

      <title>Study of solar activity with AERA at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

Abstract: Solar activity events release vast amounts of energy, including radio waves, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and energetic particles, which interact with the ionosphere of the Earth and can disrupt radio wave propagation, affecting radio communications. They can either enhance reflections, improving long-distance terrestrial communications, or cause signal degradation and absorption, respectively, depending on whether the increased ionization affects the upper or lower layers of the ionosphere. In the first case, the solar cycle modulates the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), the highest frequency usable for radio communication between two Earth-based points. The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) of the Pierre Auger Observatory was developed to measure the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band. We examine the impact of solar activity on AERA data collected over approximately 11 years. We report the detection of different types of solar radio bursts and we investigate how increased solar radiation - particularly in the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet bands - also affects measurements in the AERA energy band. Our results show a remarkable correlation between the MUF and the broadband noise observed in the $30-40$ MHz frequency range. Radio blackouts are also observed in AERA spectrograms in coincidence with those reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, we performed a search for temporal coincidences between AERA data and independent observations of solar radio burst events from the e-CALLISTO network and the SWAVES instrument. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar activity and radio wave propagation, which is also relevant for cosmic-ray detection.</description>

      <title>Relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic quantum mechanics can be considered to have begun with a search for wave equations corresponding to each intrinsic spin. However, relativistic quantum physics differs fundamentally from the non-relativistic wave mechanics. It requires a formalism allowing \ creation and destruction of particles. This gets proper treatment only in a framework called quantum field theory. This article is a semi-historic account of the intriguing new features which emerge as a part of quantum field theory. Such a discussion is impossible without a basic presentation of the formalism itself. Hence some mathematics is included in finer print. The article is directed mostly to those familiar with essential classical mechanics and basic quantum mechanics, though I strive to provide a flavour of the subject to the keenly interested non-physics reader.</description>

      <title>Running of the top quark mass at NNLO in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The running of the top quark mass ($m_\mathrm{t}$) is probed at the next-to-next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics for the first time. The result is obtained by comparing calculations in the modified minimal subtraction ($\mathrm{\overline{MS}}$) renormalisation scheme to the CMS result on differential measurement of the top quark-antiquark ($\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$) production cross section at $\sqrt{s} = 13~\mathrm{TeV}$. The scale dependence of $m_\mathrm{t}$ is extracted as a function of the invariant mass of the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ system, up to an energy scale of about $0.5~\mathrm{TeV}$. The observed running is found to be in good agreement with the three-loop solution of the renormalisation group equations of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>$\pi$- and $K$-meson properties for large $N_f$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The restoration of dynamical chiral symmetry for a higher number of light-quark flavors $N_f$ implies suppression of the dynamically generated quark mass. The study of various larger values of $N_f$ may have a greater impact on the internal structure of light hadrons. In this work, we study the properties of the $\pi$- (pion) and $K$-meson (kaon), such as the mass, condensate, and leptonic decay constant, for various $N_f$. We use the symmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dependent contact interaction model of quark. The dynamical quark masses are calculated using the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE). The masses of pion ($m_{\pi}$) and kaon ($m_{K}$) for different values of $N_f$ and are determined using the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation. For fixed $N_c=3$ and $N_f$ is increased, the dynamically generated quark mass $M_{u/d}$ ( mass of up and down quarks), strange quark mass ($M_s$), meson in-condensate $\kappa^{1/3}_{(\pi,K)}$, and decay constant $f_{(\pi, K)}$. monotonically decrease as a function of $N_f$, except for the pion and kaon mass $m_{(\pi, K)}$, which increase above a critical value of $N_f$ around $8$. This is the region where chiral symmetry is restored and the pion and kaon behave as free particles, similar to thier behavior in the the presence of a heat bath. The results obtained for fixed $N_f=2$ and $N_c=3$ are fairly in decent agreement with experimentally calculated statistics and previous model calculations based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the role of Roberge-Weiss periodicity in the thermodynamics of quantum chromodynamics at moderately high temperature, where the semi-quark-gluon plasma is expected. From the construction of the grand canonical partition function at zero and also at finite density via the canonical approach, we are able to discuss the relation between contributions of the Polyakov-loop phase and Roberge-Weiss periodicity. Then, we can conclude that the existence of Roberge-Weiss periodicity is a necessary condition to reproduce exact results at moderately high temperature.</description>

      <title>Magnets are Weber Bar Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a gravitational wave (GW) passes through a DC magnetic field, it couples to the conducting wires carrying the currents which generate the magnetic field, causing them to oscillate at the GW frequency. The oscillating currents then generate an AC component through which the GW can be detected - thus forming a resonant mass detector or a Magnetic Weber Bar. We quantify this claim and demonstrate that magnets can have exceptional sensitivity to GWs over a frequency range demarcated by the mechanical and electromagnetic resonant frequencies of the system; indeed, we outline why a magnetic readout strategy can be considered an optimal Weber bar design. The concept is applicable to a broad class of magnets, but can be particularly well exploited by the powerful magnets being deployed in search of axion dark matter, for example by DMRadio and ADMX-EFR. Explicitly, we demonstrate that the MRI magnet that is being deployed for ADMX-EFR can achieve a broadband GW strain sensitivity of $\sim$$10^{-20}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ from a few kHz to about 10 MHz, with a peak sensitivity down to $\sim$$10^{-22}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at a kHz exploiting a mechanical resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rotation effect on the QCD properties is an open question. We study the dynamic gluon mass in a dense QCD matter, the rotation is introduced by taking a covariant transformation between the flat and curved spaces. The law of causality which restricts the rotation strength of the system is carefully considered in the calculation. we find that the rotation effect is not monotonous. Overall, it behaves like an anti-screening effect, reflecting in the decreasing gluon mass, but the strength changes with the rotation. For a QCD matter with low baryon density, the screening effect in the flat space can be completely canceled by the rotation, and gluons are confined in a strongly rotating matter. When the rotation is extremely high, the matter approaches to a weakly interacting gas.</description>

      <title>Probing a diffuse flux of axion-like particles from galactic supernovae with neutrino water Cherenkov detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09595v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we claim that axion-like particles (ALPs) with MeV masses can be produced with semi-relativistic velocities in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), generating a diffuse galactic flux. We show that these ALPs can be detected in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors via $a \, p \rightarrow p \, \gamma$ interactions. Using Super-Kamiokande data, we derive new constraints on the ALP parameter space, excluding a region spanning one order of magnitude in the ALP-proton coupling above cooling bounds for ALP masses in the range of $1-70$~MeV and ALP-proton couplings between $\sim 2\times10^{-5}-2\times10^{-4}$. We show that the future Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to probe couplings as small as $\sim 10^{-5}$, considerably constraining the allowed region above SN 1987A cooling bounds.</description>

Abstract: I numerically estimate the spacetime profile of the electromagnetic fields produced in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions at $\sqsNN=2.4\,\mathchar`-\,7.7\;{\rm GeV}$ for a wide range of impact parameters $b=0\,\mathchar`-\,9\;{\rm fm}$, using a hadronic cascade model, JAM (Jet AA Microscopic transport model). I demonstrate that (1) the produced electromagnetic fields are as strong as $eE, eB = {\mathcal O}((50\;{\rm MeV})^2)$; (2) that the produced fields extend in spacetime about $V_4 = {\mathcal O}((10\;{\rm fm})^4)$; (3) that the magnetic field dominates around the collision point, while the other broad regions of spacetime are dominated by the electric field; and (4) that a topological electromagnetic-field configuration such that ${\bm E}\cdot {\bm B} \neq 0$ is realized.</description>

      <title>Constraining the CME in AVFD-simulated heavy-ion collisions using the Sliding Dumbbell Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) framework is utilized to generate $^{197}_{79}Au+^{197}_{79}Au$, $^{96}_{44}Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$, and $^{96}_{40}Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$ collision events at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV to investigate the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). The CME signal is modulated through the axial charge per entropy density ($n_5/s$) in each event to produce data sets with varying CME signal strengths. Additionally, a 33$\%$ local charge conservation (LCC) is implemented in each event. These data sets are analyzed using CME-sensitive two- and three-particle correlators. Furthermore, the Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM) is employed to identify potential CME-like events within each data set. The identified events selected using the SDM exhibit characteristics consistent with CME. The CME fraction in these events is quantified while accounting for background contributions.</description>

      <title>Power corrections to the production of a color-singlet final state in hadron collisions in the N-jettiness slicing scheme at NLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute next-to-leading power corrections in the zero-jettiness variable for the production of colorless final states at hadron colliders at next-to-leading order in QCD. To assess if the process-independence of leading power contributions can be extended, we attempt to construct generic expansions of phase spaces and matrix elements squared through next-to-leading power in the zero-jettiness. We highlight challenges associated with the collinear limit, where universality no longer holds at the subleading power, making the result process-dependent. We show that quantities that need to be calculated in the collinear limit can be obtained using Berends-Giele currents, enabling computation of power corrections to high-multiplicity final states. As a concrete example, we apply our method to compute power corrections in the zero-jettiness for lepton pair as well as multi-photon production in $q \bar q$ collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{ub}|$ by the semileptonic decay $B^+\to \omega\ell^+\nu$. For the transition form factors (TFFs) $A_1(q^2)$, $A_2(q^2)$, and $V(q^2)$ of $B^+\to \omega$, we employ the QCD light-cone sum rules method for calculation, and by constructing the correlation function using left-handed chiral current, we make the $\delta^1$-order twist-2 light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDA) $\phi^\| _{2;\omega}(x,\mu)$ dominate the contribution, in which the twist-2 LCDA $\phi^\| _{2;\omega}(x,\mu)$ is constructed by the light-cone harmonic oscillator model. Then, we obtain $A_1(0)=0.209^{+0.049}_{-0.042}$, $A_2(0)=0.206^{+0.051}_{-0.042}$, and $V(0)=0.258^{+0.058}_{-0.048}$ at the large recoil region. Two important ratios of TFFs are $r_V=1.234_{-0.322}^{+0.425}$ and $r_2=0.985_{-0.274}^{+0.347}$. After extrapolating TFFs to the whole physical $q^2$ region by a simplified $z(q^2,t)$-series expansion, we obtain the differential decay width and branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to \omega\ell^+\nu)=(1.35^{+0.02+1.22}_{-0.03-0.66})\times 10^{-4}$, which show good agreement with \textit{BABAR} and Belle Collaborations. Finally, we extract the $|V_{ub}|$ by using the $\mathcal{B}_{\rm{Exp}}(B^+\to \omega\ell^+\nu)$ result from the \textit{BABAR} Collaboration, which leads to $|V_{ub}|=(3.66^{+0.12+1.26}_{-0.17-0.95})\times 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>The Drell-Yan Process at NNLL$^\prime$+NNLO using Rapidity Dependent Jet Vetoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results for the Drell-Yan process $pp \to Z/\gamma^* + X \to l^+l^- + X$ in the presence of the rapidity dependent jet vetoes $\mathcal{T}_{Bj}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{Cj}.$ These observables provide a tighter veto at central rapidities than at forward rapidities. Our predictions contain a resummation of large logarithms of the veto scale over the hard scale, matched to fixed order in perturbation theory; we present results at both NLL$^\prime$+NLO and NNLL$^\prime$+NNLO. Uncertainty estimates are provided that contain both resummation and fixed-order uncertainties; we find that using a standard profile scale variation procedure for the former seems to underestimate the uncertainty, particularly at NLL$^\prime$+NLO. Consequently, we modify the procedure to avoid cancellation of scale variations between partonic channels, and verify that the uncertainties from this method are reasonable using a simplified version of the Theory Nuisance Parameter (TNP) method. We then find that the uncertainty decreases going from the NLL$^\prime$+NLO to the NNLL$^\prime$+NNLO predictions, and obtain an uncertainty at the level of $1-3\%$ in the NNLL$^\prime$+NNLO predictions when the veto scale is of $\mathcal{O}(10 \text{ GeV})$.</description>

      <title>Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Modified Palatini Inflation Meets ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the coexistence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity $f_{\mathcal{R}}=1+c{\mathcal{R}} \phi^{n/2}$ with a kinetic mixing of the form $f_K = f_{\mathcal{R}}^m$ -- where $n=2$ and 4 and $0.5 \le m \le 10$ -- reconciles chaotic inflation based on the $\phi^n$ potential with the recent ACT results, if we adopt the Palatini formulation of gravity. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. The model can be also embedded in supergravity by introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. Its stabilization is achieved thanks to a compact contribution to the Kaehler potential, whose the inflationary part includes an holomorphic logarithmic term and a real one multiplying a shift-symmetric quadratic polynomial term.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard and Tsallis distributions from transverse momentum spectra in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons, specifically bosons ($\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$) as well as fermions [$p(\bar p)$], produced in small collision systems, namely deuteron-gold (d+Au) and proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the top energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, are investigated in this paper. In present study, d+Au collisions are categorized into three centrality classes: central (0--20\%), semi-central (20--40\%), and peripheral (40--100\%) collisions. Various types of distributions, including standard [Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) and Boltzmann] and Tsallis distributions, are employed to fit the same $p_T$ spectra to derive different effective temperatures denoted as $T_{eff}$. The results indicate that $T_{eff}$ values obtained from Bose-Einstein, Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Tsallis distributions exhibit systematically a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, these $T_{eff}$ values also show a decreasing trend with a decrease in collision centrality. Furthermore, based on the spectra of given particles, a perfect linear relationship is observed between different pairwise combinations of $T_{eff}$ derived from both Boltzmann and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions as well as between Tsallis and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Left-Right Breaking from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early universe can generate stochastic gravitational waves (GWs), offering a unique probe of high-scale particle physics. The Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), which restores parity symmetry at high energies and naturally incorporates the seesaw mechanism, allows for such transitions -- particularly during the spontaneous breaking of $SU(2)_R \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_{B-L} \to SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$. This initial step, though less studied, is both theoretically motivated and potentially observable via GWs. In this work, we investigate the GW signatures associated with this first-step phase transition in the minimal LRSM. Due to the complexity and dimensionality of its parameter space, traditional scanning approaches are computationally intensive and inefficient. To overcome this challenge, we employ a Machine Learning Scan (MLS) strategy, integrated with the high-precision three-dimensional effective field theory framework -- using PhaseTracer as an interface to DRalgo -- to efficiently identify phenomenologically viable regions of the parameter space. Through successive MLS iterations, we identify a parameter region that yields GW signals detectable at forthcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as BBO and DECIGO. Additionally, we analyse the evolution of the MLS-recommended parameter space across iterations and perform a sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential parameters in the model. Our findings underscore both the observational prospects of gravitational waves from LRSM phase transitions and the efficacy of machine learning techniques in probing complex beyond the Standard-Model landscapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phases of a strongly coupled QCD-like theory at finite baryon chemical potential using s-confining supersymmetric QCD deformed by anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Focusing on the case of three colors and four flavors, we identify novel phases including spontaneous breaking of baryon number and/or parity. Both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed as the baryon chemical potential is varied. These findings may offer insights into possible phases of real QCD at intermediate baryon densities.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition, Gravitational Waves and Collider Probes in Multi-Scalar Dark Matter Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study scalar singlet extensions of the Standard Model (SM), focusing on scenarios where dark matter (DM) is stabilized by a \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) symmetry. In the minimal single-scalar extension of the SM, only a narrow region near the Higgs resonance remains viable, requiring small portal couplings in order to simultaneously satisfy the observed relic abundance and comply with the most recent direct detection limits from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ-2024) and XENON1T experiments. To address this limitation, we extend the dark sector by introducing additional real singlet scalars. In both two- and three-singlet extensions, we demonstrate that the observed dark matter relic density can be accommodated with larger Higgs portal couplings. These couplings significantly impact early-Universe dynamics by enhancing the strength of the electroweak phase transition. Both the two- and three-singlet scalar extensions can induce a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, generating stochastic gravitational waves potentially observable at future space-based detectors such as LISA and DECIGO. Notably, the three-singlet scenario induce an even stronger transition compared to the two-singlet case, enhancing the gravitational wave signal strength. Our results highlight the potential of extended scalar sectors as testable frameworks connecting dark matter and gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Amplification for Muon-to-Positron Conversion in Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the lepton-number and lepton-flavour-violating process of muon-to-positron conversion $\mu^- + N \rightarrow e^+ + N'$, in the presence of an ultralight scalar dark matter (ULSDM) field which couples to neutrinos. The ULSDM contributes to the effective off-diagonal Majorana mass $ m_{\mu e}$, therefore amplifying the rate of muon-to-positron conversion to experimentally observable levels. Using existing bounds from SINDRUM II, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, we derive constraints on the flavour-off-diagonal couplings of neutrinos to ULSDM for the first time. Our work reveals that upcoming experiments can provide stronger sensitivity to these new couplings than bounds arising from cosmological surveys and terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>PolyBin3D: A Suite of Optimal and Efficient Power Spectrum and Bispectrum Estimators for Large-Scale Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional data into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python/Cython implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask and weighting scheme. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed" estimators and their idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration using JAX. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions have emerged as compelling candidates for describing the dark sector of the Universe. In this work, we explore quintessence models inspired by axion-like potentials as a dynamical alternative to the cosmological constant. These models naturally exhibit a tracking behaviour, reducing the need for fine-tuned initial conditions. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on a complete cosmological dataset of Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB), DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, low-$z$ Cepheid anchors, and DES Y1 large scale structure measurement. Unfortunately, neither the Hubble tension nor the $S_8$ tension is eased. The model does reach parity with $\Lambda$CDM model statistically according to DIC, WAIC and Bayesian ratio, suggesting that a quintessence model may still help with the cosmic tension by further extending the model we have investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the interference between meson exchange currents (MEC) and one-body currents in quasielastic electron scattering, with a focus on the sign of this interference in the transverse response for one-particle emission. We prove that the interference of both the Delta and pion-in-flight currents with the one-body current is negative, leading to a partial cancellation with the seagull current. This is mathematically demonstrated within the framework of the Fermi gas model. By comparing these interferences across various independent particle models, both relativistic and non-relativistic, our results indicate that all studied models display the same behavior. This consistency suggests that the interference is negative in models that do not incorporate tensor correlations in the nuclear wave function.</description>

      <title>Investigating the correlation between ZTF TDEs and IceCube high-energy neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the correlation between the TDE population and IceCube neutrinos could help us better understand whether TDEs could be potential high-energy neutrino emitters. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for TDEs that are associated with neutrinos in a sample including 143 IceCube neutrino alert events and 52 TDEs classified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) - Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Furthermore, considering that the TDEs/TDE candidates reported as potential IceCube neutrino emitters are all accompanied by infrared (IR) echo emissions, we further select the TDEs with IR echoes from these 52 TDEs as a subsample to examine the correlation with neutrinos. Based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission database, seven TDEs are identified as having IR echoes. Then we employ Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the correlation between the TDE sample/subsample and IceCube neutrinos. Finally, after considering spatial and temporal criteria, the seven TDEs with IR echoes show the most significant correlation at a 2.46$\sigma$ confidence level. If we tentatively further take the time delay factor into account, the correlation enhances to a 2.66$\sigma$ confidence level. The correlation is primarily contributed by two TDEs: AT2019dsg and AT2019azh. The latter's association with a neutrino alert, IC230217A, is newly reported in this work. We discussed the possible physical connection between AT2019azh and the neutrino event IC230217A.</description>

Abstract: By consideration of the Compact object HESS J1731-347 as a hybrid twin compact star, i.e., a more compact star than its hadronic twin of the same mass, its stellar properties are derived. Besides showing that the properties of compact stars in this work are in good agreement with state-of-the-art constraints both from measurements carried out in laboratory experiments as well as by multi-messenger astronomy observations, the realization of an early strong hadron-quark first order phase transition as implied by the twins is discussed.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Quenched $g_A$ in Nuclear Matter To Dense Compact-Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An argument is developed that the long-standing mystery in nuclear physics of the effective axial-current coupling constant in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$, could be understood in terms of the mechanism referred to as ``pseudo-conformal sound speed" in dense compact-star matter, $v_{\rm pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$. Both pros and cons are presented using an effective field theory anchored on renormalization-group approach to interacting baryons on the Fermi surface that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's highly successful EFT $\chi$EFT$_\pi$ with the pion field only (in nuclear medium) by implementing heavy-meson degrees of freedom. Both hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry, the former involving the vector mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$ and the latter involving the hidden scalar meson, a dilaton $\hat{\sigma}$ ($f_0(500)$), play the crucial role. Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter $n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity" is brought in via the topological structure of the nucleon, i.e., skyrmion considered to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$ limit. The new inputs for the argumentation are the large N limit of the Grassmanian model for hidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \leq 3$ involving ``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton" for hidden scale symmetry.</description>

      <title>Extraction of ground-state nuclear deformations from ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions: Nuclear structure physics context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions has recently been used to characterize nuclear collective states. In this paper, we assess the foundations of the shape-imaging technique employed in these studies. We conclude that, on the whole, the discussion regarding low-energy nuclear physics is confusing and the suggested impact on nuclear structure research is overstated. Conversely, efforts to incorporate existing knowledge on nuclear shapes into analysis pipelines can be beneficial for benchmarking tools and calibrating models used to extract information from ultra-relativistic heavy ion experiments.</description>
