      <title>Development and pilot evaluation of a virtual reality simulator for HDR prostate brachytherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a virtual reality simulator for high dose rate prostate brachytherapy and to test whether participation is associated with immediate gains in self-reported confidence across predefined procedural domains in two cohorts. Methods: Two modules were developed and implemented using Unreal Engine: patient preparation and template guided needle insertion. Oncology staff and trainees completed pre and post surveys that assessed confidence for recalling steps, explaining steps, identifying equipment, and explaining equipment function. Studies were conducted at the Hands On Brachytherapy Workshop (HOWBT) in London, Ontario, and at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre in Toronto, Ontario. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests with two-sided p values compared before and after scores within each module. Results: Patient preparation (N=11) confidence increased for recalling steps (W=65, p=0.002), explaining steps (W=51, p = 0.023), identifying equipment (W=65, p=0.002), and explaining equipment function (W=60, p=0.0078). Needle insertion (N=27) confidence increased for recalling steps (W=292, p&lt;0.001), explaining steps (W=347, p&lt;0.001), identifying equipment (W=355, p&lt;0.001), and explaining equipment function (W=354, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The simulator was feasible to deploy and was associated with higher self-reported confidence across key domains immediately after training. Findings may inform future curriculum design and implementation work.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous optimization of non-coplanar beam orientations and cumulative EQD2 distribution for high-dose reirradiation of locoregionally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Purpose: Reirradiation for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is commonly delivered using coplanar techniques. In this study, we developed a beam orientation optimization algorithm for reirradiation planning to investigate whether the selection of favorable non-coplanar beam orientations may limit cumulative doses to critical organs-at-risk (OARs) and thus improve the therapeutic window.
  Materials and Methods: Fifteen cases of challenging high-dose reirradiation for locoregionally recurrent NSCLC were included in this in-silico study. For each patient, the dose distribution from the previous treatment was first mapped to the reirradiation planning CT using rigid dose registration, and subsequently converted to equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). A 2-arc non-coplanar reirradiation plan, combining dynamic gantry and couch rotation, was then generated using an EQD2-based direct aperture optimization algorithm, which allows for the simultaneous optimization of the dynamic gantry-couch path and the cumulative EQD2 distribution. Non-coplanar reirradiation plans were benchmarked against 2-arc coplanar VMAT plans, which mimic state-of-the-art practice for reirradiation of NSCLC.
  Results: Non-coplanar reirradiation plans could reduce the maximum cumulative EQD2 to critical OARs such as bronchial tree, esophagus, thoracic wall and trachea by at least 5 Gy2 for 6 out of 15 patients compared to coplanar reirradiation plans. At the same time, target coverage and lung EQD2 metrics were comparable for both methods.
  Conclusions: The automated selection of favorable non-coplanar beam orientations may reduce the maximum cumulative EQD2 to critical OARs in challenging thoracic reirradiation cases. This allows to explore either better OAR sparing or dose-escalation in future clinical studies.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Head Movement in a Brain PET Scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When acquiring PET images, body motions are unavoidable, given that the acquisition time could last 10-20 minutes or more. These motions can seriously deteriorate the quality of the final image at the level of image reconstruction and attenuation corrections. Movements can have rhythmic patterns, related to respiratory or cardiac motions, or they can be abrupt reflexive actions caused by the patient's discomfort. Many approaches, software and hardware, have been developed to mitigate this problem where each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this work we present a simulation study of a head monitoring device, named CrowN@22, intended to be used in conjunction with a dedicated brain PET scanner. The CrowN@22 device consists of six point sources of non-pure positron emitter isotopes, such as 22Na or 44Sc, mounted in crown-like rings around the head of the patient. The relative positions of the point sources are predefined and their actual position, once mounted, can be reconstructed by tagging the extra 1274 keV photon (in the case of 22Na). These two factors contribute to a superb signal-to-noise ratio, distinguishing between the signal from the 22Na monitor point sources and the background signal from the FDG in the brain. Hence, even with a low activity for the monitor point sources, as low as 10 kBq per point source, in the presence of 75 MBq activity of 18F in the brain, one can detect brain movements with a precision of less than 0.3 degrees, or 0.5 mm, which is of the order of the PET spatial resolution, at a sampling rate of 1 Hz.</description>

      <title>Fraction-variant VMAT planning for patients with complex gynecological and head-and-neck cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Purpose: Increasing the number of arcs in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) allows for better intensity modulation and may improve plan quality. However, this leads to longer delivery times, which may cause patient discomfort and increase intra-fractional motion. In this study, it was investigated whether the delivery of different VMAT plans in different fractions may improve the dosimetric quality and delivery efficiency for the treatment of patients with complex tumor geometries.
  Materials and Methods: A direct aperture optimization algorithm was developed which allows for the simultaneous optimization of different VMAT plans to be delivered in different fractions, based on their cumulative physical dose. Each VMAT plan is constrained to deliver a uniform dose within the target volume, such that the entire treatment does not alter the fractionation scheme and is robust against inter-fractional setup errors. This approach was evaluated in-silico for ten patients with gynecological and head-and-neck cancer.
  Results: For all patients, fraction-variant treatments achieved better target coverage and reduced the dose to critical organs-at-risk compared to fraction-invariant treatments that deliver the same plan in every fraction, where the dosimetric benefit was shown to increase with the number of different plans to be delivered. In addition, 1-arc and 2-arc fraction-variant treatments could approximate the dosimetric quality of 3-arc fraction-invariant treatments, while reducing the delivery time from 180 s to 60 s and 120 s, respectively.
  Conclusions: Fraction-variant VMAT treatments may achieve excellent dosimetric quality for patients with complex tumor geometries, while keeping the delivery time per fraction viable.</description>

      <title>Zoeppritz equations: from seismology to medical exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than a century ago, Karl Bernhard Zoeppritz derived the equations that determine the reflected and transmitted coefficients at a planar interface for an incident seismic wave. The coefficients so obtained are a function of the elastic parameters of the media on each side of the interface and the angle of incidence. Approximations of the equations have been proposed and used in geophysical exploration, however, full use of the equations and their generalization to multiple layers could offer richer information about the properties of the media and be helpful in medical diagnosis via ultrasound. In this work, we investigate how to extract information from the angle-dependent reflection coefficients, including critical angles and the wave distortion at the interface between two and three media. It is shown that it is possible to separate the effect of density from speed of sound mismatch by measuring amplitudes as a function of angle of incidence (AVA). And examining the critical angle and waveform distortion of the reflected waves can reveal the thickness of an intermediate layer, even with subwavelength resolution. These studies could be integrated into medical imaging and also into the training of artificial intelligence systems that assist in diagnosis. In particular, they could help prevent cerebrovascular accidents by early detection of the formation and hardening of plaque in the arteries that irrigate the brain.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cytometry with Machine Learning for Shape-Resolved Microplastic Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microplastics are increasingly recognized as a global environmental health threat, yet their detection and characterization remain constrained by the cost, form factor, and throughput of existing analytical tools. Portable micro/nanotechnology-based sensors are emerging to address this need, but most rely on the assumption of spherical particle geometry in their operating principle, limiting their relevance for environmental analysis. Here, we overcome this limitation by advancing microwave cytometry with machine learning-enabled shape recognition. Microwave cytometry is a flow-through electronic platform that integrates microwave resonator responses with low-frequency impedance signals to capture the dielectric signatures of individual particles. Using microscopy-derived shape measurements as ground truth, we trained a random forest model to decode these information-rich waveforms. Once trained, the system operates without optical input, enabling electronic-only determination of particle geometry. We demonstrate extraction of the major and minor axes of ellipsoidal microparticles with &lt;8% relative error on average and use these predictions to derive the dielectric permittivity of ellipsoid particles. This approach removes long-standing shape assumptions in microplastic sensing and establishes a pathway toward portable, high-throughput, morphology-aware detection technologies.</description>
