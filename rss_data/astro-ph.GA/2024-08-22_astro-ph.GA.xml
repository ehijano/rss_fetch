      <title>High detection significance of the dark substructure in gravitational lens SDSSJ0946+1006 is revealed by image pixel supersampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the dark substructure reported in the gravitational lens SDSSJ0946+1006 has a high central density which is in apparent tension with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. However, the detection significance of the substructure has been found in Ballard et al. (2024) to be sensitive to the assumed prior on the smoothness of the source galaxy: a sufficiently noisy source allows for noise-level residuals even without including a subhalo in the model. Here we show that the detection significance of the substructure is higher than previously reported ($\Delta\ln Z \approx 143$, equivalent to a $\sim17\sigma$ detection) by approximating the integration of light over each pixel via ray tracing and averaging over many subpixels--a technique known as supersampling--and this result is insensitive to the assumed prior on the source galaxy smoothness. Assuming a dark matter subhalo, supersampling also tightens the subhalo constraints: we find that the subhalo's projected mass enclosed within 1 kpc lies within the range $(2.2-3.4)\times10^9M_\odot$ at the 95\% confidence level in our highest evidence model, while the log-slope of the subhalo's projected density profile at 1 kpc is steeper than $-1.75$ at the 95\% confidence level, further establishing it as an outlier compared to expectations from CDM. Supersampling also allows us to identify a systematic within the data that has biased the slope of the primary lensing galaxy's density profile in prior studies, which we speculate might be due to the presence of dust or an imperfect foreground subtraction. Our analysis places the existence of the substructure in SDSSJ0946+1006 on firmer ground, and should motivate deeper follow-up observations to better constrain the properties of this substructure and clarify the severity of its apparent tension with $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>The densities in diffuse and translucent molecular clouds: estimates from observations of C$_2$ and from 3-dimensional extinction maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newly-computed collisional rate coefficients for the excitation of C$_2$ in collisions with H$_2$, presented recently by Najar and Kalugina (2020), are significantly larger than the values adopted previously in models for the excitation of the C$_2$ molecule, a widely used probe of the interstellar gas density. With these new rate coefficients, we have modeled the C$_2$ rotational distributions inferred from visible and ultraviolet absorption observations of electronic transitions of C$_2$ towards a collection of 46 nearby background sources. The inferred gas densities in the foreground interstellar clouds responsible for the observed C$_2$ absorption are a factor 4 to 7 smaller than those inferred previously, a direct reflection of the larger collisional rate coefficients computed by Najar and Kalugina (2020). These lower density estimates are generally in good agreement with the peak densities inferred from 3D extinction maps for the relevant sightlines. In cases where H$_3^+$ absorption has also been observed and used to estimate the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), our estimates of the latter will also decrease accordingly because the H$_3^+$ abundance is a function of the ratio of the CRIR to the gas density.</description>

      <title>First joint MUSE, HST, and JWST spectro-photometric analysis of the intracluster light: the case of the relaxed cluster RX J2129.7+0005</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most detailed spectrum of the intracluster light (ICL) in an individual cluster to date, the relaxed system RX J2129.7+0005, at $z\sim 0.234$. Using 15 broad-band, deep images observed with HST and JWST in the optical and the infrared, plus deep integral field spectroscopy from MUSE, we computed a total of 3696 ICL maps spanning the spectral range $\sim 0.4-5$ $\mu$m with our algorithm CICLE, a method that is extremely well suited to analyzing large samples of data in a fully automated way. We used both parametric and non-parametric approaches to fit the spectral energy distribution of the ICL and infer its physical properties, yielding a stellar mass $log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})$ between $11.5-12.7$ and an average age between $9.7-10.5$ Gyr, from CIGALE and Prospector results. This implies that the ICL in RX J2129.7+0005 is, on average, older than that of disturbed clusters, suggesting that the contribution from different stellar populations to the ICL are at play depending on the cluster's dynamical state. Coupled with X-ray observations of the hot gas distribution, we confirm the relaxed state of RX J2129.7+0005, showing clear signs of sloshing after a last major merger with a high-mass ratio satellite that could have happened $\sim 6.6$ Gyr ago in a relatively radial orbit. The presence of substructure in the ICL, such as shells, clouds with different densities and a certain degree of boxyness, and a clump, supports this scenario.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) IX: The enriched circumgalactic and intergalactic medium around star-forming field dwarf galaxies traced by O VI absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shallow potential wells of star-forming dwarf galaxies make their surrounding circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (CGM/IGM) sensitive laboratories for studying the inflows and outflows thought to regulate galaxy evolution. We present new absorption-line measurements in quasar sightlines probing within projected distances of $&lt;300$ kpc from 91 star-forming field dwarf galaxies with a median stellar mass of $\log{M_\star/\rm{M_\odot}} \approx 8.3$ at $0.077 &lt; z &lt; 0.73$ from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS). In this redshift range, the CUBS quasar spectra cover a suite of transitions including H I, low and intermediate metal ions (e.g., C II, Si II, C III, and Si III), and highly ionized O VI. This CUBS-Dwarfs survey enables constraints with samples 9$\times$ larger than past dwarf CGM/IGM studies with similar ionic coverage. We find that low and intermediate ionization metal absorption is rare around dwarf galaxies, consistent with previous surveys of local dwarfs. In contrast, highly ionized O VI is commonly observed in sightlines that pass within the virial radius of a dwarf, and O VI detection rates are non-negligible at projected distances of 1$-$2$\times$ the virial radius. Based on these measurements, we estimate that the O VI-bearing phase of the CGM/IGM accounts for a dominant share of the metal budget of dwarf galaxies. The absorption kinematics suggest that a relatively modest fraction of the O VI-bearing gas is formally unbound. Together, these results imply that low-mass systems at $z\lesssim 1$ effectively retain a substantial fraction of their metals within the nearby CGM and IGM.</description>

      <title>From 100 MHz to 10 GHz: Unveiling the spectral evolution of the X-shaped radio galaxy in Abell 3670</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs) are characterised by two pairs of misaligned lobes, namely the active lobes hosting radio jets and the wings. None of the formation mechanisms proposed so far can exhaustively reproduce the diverse features observed among XRGs. The emerging evidence is the existence of sub-populations of XRGs forming via different processes. The brightest cluster galaxy in Abell 3670 (A3670) is a dumbbell system hosting the XRG MRC 2011-298. The morphological and spectral properties of this interesting XRG have been first characterised through Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) data at 1-10 GHz. In the present work, we followed-up MRC 2011-298 with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 120-800 MHz to further constrain its properties and origin. We carried out a detailed spectral analysis sampling different spatial scales. Integrated radio spectra, spectral index maps, radio colour-colour diagrams, and radiative age maps of both the active lobes and prominent wings have been employed to test the origin of the source. We confirm a progressive spectral steepening from the lobes to the wings. The maximum radiative age of the source is $\sim 80$ Myr, with the wings being older than the lobes by $\gtrsim 30$ Myr in their outermost regions. The observed properties are in line with an abrupt reorientation of the jets by $\sim 90$ deg from the direction of the wings to their present position. This formation mechanism is further supported by the comparison with numerical simulations in the literature, which additionally highlight the role of hydrodynamic processes in the evolution of large wings such as those of MRC 2011-298. Potentially, the coalescence of supermassive black holes could have triggered the spin-flip of the jets. Moreover, we show that the S-shape of the radio jets is likely driven by precession with a period $P \sim 10$ Myr.</description>

      <title>Discovered a new open cluster near the poorly studied Majaess 190</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a comprehensive astrophysical study of a newly discovered open cluster, dubbed Ash-1. Using the third data release of the Gaia space mission, Gaia DR3, Ash-1 was accidentally discovered within the constellation Sagittarius in the field of the poorly studied cluster Majaess 190. Here we present the first estimates of these two clusters' primary astrophysical properties. The membership probabilities P&gt;0.50 were assigned to both clusters using the pyUPMASK technique. The distances were determined using the parallaxes of the clusters' members, which were consistent with the isochrone fitting of the color-magnitude diagrams. The ages and distances of Majaess 190 and Ash-1 are found to be 4 Gyr and 630 Myr; 2130 and 1360 pc, respectively. The extinctions, heliocentric distances, mass function, luminosity function, and overall masses of the studied clusters were also computed. Based on the relaxation times, it appears that both clusters are in a state of dynamic relaxation.</description>

      <title>emPDF: Inferring the Milky Way mass with data-driven distribution function in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the emPDF (Empirical Distribution Function), a novel dynamical modeling method that infers the gravitational potential from kinematic tracers with optimal statistical efficiency under the minimal assumption of steady state. emPDF determines the best-fit potential by maximizing the similarity between instantaneous kinematics and the time-averaged phase-space distribution function (DF), which is empirically constructed from observation upon the theoretical foundation of oPDF (Han et al. 2016). This approach eliminates the need for presumed functional forms of DFs or orbit libraries required by conventional DF- or orbit-based methods. emPDF stands out for its flexibility, efficiency, and capability in handling observational effects, making it preferable to the popular Jeans equation or other minimal assumption methods, especially for the Milky Way (MW) outer halo where tracers often have limited sample size and poor data quality. We apply emPDF to infer the MW mass profile using Gaia DR3 data of satellite galaxies and globular clusters, obtaining consistent measurements with the constraints from simulation-informed DF fitting (Li et al. 2020). While the simulation-informed DF offers superior precision owing to the additional information extracted from simulations, emPDF is independent of such supplementary knowledge and applicable to general tracer populations. We provide tabulated measurements of the mass profile from emPDF, along with updated measurements from simulation-informed DF.</description>

      <title>Re-evaluation of the cosmic-ray ionization rate in diffuse clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All current estimates of the cosmic-ray (CR) ionization rate rely on assessments of the gas density along the probed sight lines. Until now, these have been based on observations of different tracers, with C$_2$ being the most widely used in diffuse molecular clouds for this purpose. However, three-dimensional dust extinction maps have recently reached sufficient accuracy as to give an independent measurement of the gas density on parsec scales. In addition, they allow us to identify the gas clumps along each sight line, thus localizing the regions where CR ionization is probed. We re-evaluate H$_3^+$ observations, which are often considered as the most reliable method to measure the H$_2$ ionization rate $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$ in diffuse clouds. The peak density values derived from the extinction maps for 12 analyzed sight lines turn out to be, on average, an order of magnitude lower than the previous estimates, and agree with the values obtained from revised analysis of C$_2$ data. We use the extinction maps in combination with the 3D-PDR code to self-consistently compute the H$_3^+$ and H$_2$ abundances in the identified clumps for different values of $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$. For each sight line, we obtain the optimum value by comparing the simulation results with observations. We show that $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$ is systematically reduced with respect to the earlier estimates by a factor of $\approx 9$ on average, to $\approx6\times10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$, primarily as a result of the density reduction. We emphasize that these results have profound consequences for all available measurements of the ionization rate.</description>

      <title>CHIMPS2: $^{13}$CO $J = 3 \to 2$ emission in the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the initial data for the ($J = 3 \to 2$) transition of $^{13}$CO obtained from the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way as part of the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey 2 (CHIMPS2). Covering $359^\circ \leq l \leq 1^\circ$ and $|b| \leq 0.5^\circ$ with an angular resolution of 19 arcsec, velocity resolution of 1 km s$^{-1}$, and rms $T_A^* = 0.59$ K at these resolutions, our observations unveil the complex structure of the CMZ molecular gas in improved detail. Complemented by the $^{12}$CO CHIMPS2 data, we estimate a median optical depth of $\tau_{13} = 0.087$. The preliminary analysis yields a median $^{13}$CO column density range equal to $N(^{13}\text{CO})= 2$--$5 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, median H$_2$ column density equal to $N(\text{H}_2)= 4 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to $1 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.
  We derive $N(\text{H}_2)$-based total mass estimates of $M(\text{H}_2)= 2$--$6 \times 10^7\, M_{\odot}$, in agreement with previous studies. We analyze the relationship between the integrated intensity of $^{13}$CO and the surface density of compact sources identified by Herschel Hi-GAL, and find that younger Hi-GAL sources detected at 500 $\mu$m but not at 70 $\mu$m follow the dense gas of the CMZ more closely than those that are bright at 70 $\mu$m. The latter, actively star-forming sources, appear to be more associated with material in the foreground spiral arms.</description>

      <title>Survey of Complex Organic Molecules in Starless and Prestellar Cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold ($\sim$10 K) and dense ($\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) cores of gas and dust within molecular clouds, known as starless and dynamically evolved prestellar cores, are the birthplaces of low-mass ($M$ $\leq$ few M$_\odot$) stars. As detections of interstellar complex organic molecules, or COMs, in starless cores has increased, abundance comparisons suggest that some COMs might be seeded early in the star formation process and inherited to later stages (i.e., protostellar disks and eventually comets). To date observations of COMs in starless cores have been limited, with most detections reported solely in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. It is therefore still a question whether different environments affect abundances. We have surveyed 35 starless and prestellar cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud with the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12m telescope detecting both methanol, CH$_3$OH, and acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO, in 100% and 49% of the sample, respectively. In the sub-sample of 15 cores where CH$_3$CHO was detected at $&gt;3\sigma$ ($\sim$18 mK) with the ARO 12m, follow-up observations with the Yebes 40m telescope were carried out. Detections of formic acid, $t$-HCOOH, ketene, H$_2$CCO, methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, vinyl cyanide, CH$_2$CHCN, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl ether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, are seen in at least $20\%$ of the cores. We discuss detection statistics, calculate column densities, and compare abundances across various stages of low-mass star formation. Our findings have more than doubled COM detection statistics in cold cores and show COMs are prevalent in the gas before star and planet formation in the Perseus Molecular Cloud.</description>

      <title>Chemical models of interstellar glycine and adenine precursor aminoacetonitrile (NH2CH2CN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aminoacetonitrile (AAN), also known as glycinenitrile, has been suggested as a possible precursor of glycine and adenine in the interstellar medium. Here we present the chemical modeling of AAN and its isomers in hot cores using the three-phase chemical model NAUTILUS with the addition of over 300 chemical reactions of the three AAN isomers and related species. Our models predicted a peak gas phase abundance of AAN reaching the order of 10-8, which is consistent with observation towards Sgr B2(N). Regarding the reaction pathways of AAN and its isomers, we found that AAN is primarily formed via free radical reactions on grain surfaces during the early evolutionary stages. Subsequently, it is thermally desorbed into the gas phase as the temperature rises and is then destroyed by positive ions and radicals in gas phase. The isomers of AAN are formed through the hydrogenation reaction of CH3NCN on the grain surface and via electron recombination reactions of ion C2H5N2+ in gas phase. We speculate that there is a possibility for NCCN and AAN to react with each other, eventually leading to the formation of adenine in hot cores. However, further investigation is required to understand the efficiency of grain surfaces in adenine formation, through theoretical calculations or laboratory experiments in future research.</description>

      <title>CRKSPH - A Conservative Reproducing Kernel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.00725v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) that utilizes a first-order consistent reproducing kernel, a smoothing function that exactly interpolates linear fields with particle tracers. Previous formulations using reproducing kernel (RK) interpolation have had difficulties maintaining conservation of momentum due to the fact the RK kernels are not, in general, spatially symmetric. Here, we utilize a reformulation of the fluid equations such that mass, linear momentum, and energy are all rigorously conserved without any assumption about kernel symmetries, while additionally maintaining approximate angular momentum conservation. Our approach starts from a rigorously consistent interpolation theory, where we derive the evolution equations to enforce the appropriate conservation properties, at the sacrifice of full consistency in the momentum equation. Additionally, by exploiting the increased accuracy of the RK method's gradient, we formulate a simple limiter for the artificial viscosity that reduces the excess diffusion normally incurred by the ordinary SPH artificial viscosity. Collectively, we call our suite of modifications to the traditional SPH scheme Conservative Reproducing Kernel SPH, or CRKSPH. CRKSPH retains many benefits of traditional SPH methods (such as preserving Galilean invariance and manifest conservation of mass, momentum, and energy) while improving on many of the shortcomings of SPH, particularly the overly aggressive artificial viscosity and zeroth-order inaccuracy. We compare CRKSPH to two different modern SPH formulations (pressure based SPH and compatibly differenced SPH), demonstrating the advantages of our new formulation when modeling fluid mixing, strong shock, and adiabatic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Anomalously low-mass core-He-burning star in NGC 6819 as a post-common-envelope phase product</title>

Abstract: Precise masses of red-giant stars enable a robust inference of their ages, but there are cases where these age estimates are highly precise yet very inaccurate. Examples are core-helium-burning (CHeB) stars that have lost more mass than predicted by standard single-star evolutionary models. Members of star clusters in the ${\it Kepler}$ database represent a unique opportunity to identify such stars, because they combine exquisite asteroseismic constraints with independent age information. In this work we focus on the single, metal-rich, Li-rich, low-mass, CHeB star KIC4937011, which is a member of the open cluster NGC 6819 (turn-off mass of $\approx 1.6 \, M_\odot$, i.e. age of $\approx 2.4$ Gyr). This star has $\approx 1 \, M_\odot$ less mass than expected for its age and metallicity, which could be explained by binary interactions or mass-loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). To infer formation scenarios for this object, we perform a Bayesian analysis by combining the binary stellar evolutionary framework $\texttt{binary_c v2.2.3}$ with the dynamic nested sampling approach contained in the $\texttt{dynesty v2.1.1}$ package. We find that this star is likely the result of a common-envelope evolution (CEE) phase during the RGB stage of the primary star in which the low-mass ($&lt;0.71 \, M_\odot$) main sequence companion does not survive. During the CEE phase $\approx 1 \, M_\odot$ of material is ejected from the system, and the final star reaches the CHeB stage after helium flashes as if it were a single star of mass $\approx 0.7 \, M_\odot$, which is what we observe today. Although the proposed scenario is consistent with photometric and spectroscopic observations, a quantitative comparison with detailed stellar evolution calculations is needed to quantify the systematic skewness of radius, luminosity, and effective temperature distributions towards higher values than observations.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between light curves of ellipsoidal variables with massive dark companions, contact binaries, and semidetached binaries using principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photometric methods for identifying dark companion binaries - binary systems hosting quiescent black holes and neutron stars - operate by detecting ellipsoidal variations caused by tidal interactions. The limitation of this approach is that contact and semidetached binaries can produce similarly looking light curves. In this work, we address the degeneracy of ellipsoidal light curves by studying the differences between synthetically generated light curves of dark companion, semidetached, and contact binary systems. We inject the light curves with various levels of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise to simulate the effects of instrumental noise and stellar spots. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition, we construct low-dimensional representations of the light curves. We find that the first two to five PCA components are sufficient to explain $99\%$ of variance in the data. The PCA representations are generally more informative than the Fourier representation for the same number of coefficients as measured by both the silhouette scores of the representations and the macro recalls of random forest classifiers trained on the representations. The random forest classifiers reach macro recalls from $0.97$ to $0.70$, indicating that the classes remain largely separable even under adverse conditions. We find that instrumental noise significantly impacts the class separation only when its standard deviation exceeds $10^{-3}$ mag, whereas the presence of spots can markedly reduce the class separation even when they contribute as little as $1\%$ of the light curve amplitude. We discuss the application of our method to real ellipsoidal samples, and we show that we can increase the purity of a sample of dark companion candidates by a factor of up to $27$ if we assume a prior purity of $1\%$, significantly improving the cost-efficiency of follow-up observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report VI CCD photometry of the globular cluster cluster NGC 1851. We aim to study the membership of the variable stars detected in the field of the cluster as listed in the Catalogue of Variable stars in Globular Clusters (CVSGC; Clement et al. 2001) and reported by the Gaia mission. We cross match the two sets of variables to produce light curves that lead to the estimation of physical parameters. The resulting colour-magnitude diagram (CMD), free of likely field stars, enables to confirm the position of the variables, their type and evolutionary stage. We provide new estimations of the period using data acquired on a long timebase. The Fourier decomposition of cluster member RR Lyrae light curves lead to a mean metalicity and distance of \([Fe/H]_{ZW} = -1.35 \pm 0.22\) dex and \(11.9 \pm 0.6\) kpc. The variability and membership of stars reported by Gaia-DR3 as variables in the field of the cluster is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Three Galactic Wolf-Rayet Stars</title>

Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are evolved massive stars in the brief stage before they undergo core collapse. Not only are they rare, but they also can be particularly difficult to find due to the high extinction in the Galactic plane. This paper discusses the discovery of three new Galactic WRs previously classified as H$\alpha$ emission stars, but thanks to Gaia spectra, we were able to identify the broad, strong emission lines that characterize WRs. Using the Lowell Discovery Telescope and the DeVeny spectrograph, we obtained spectra for each star. Two are WC9s, and the third is a WN6 + O6.5 V binary. The latter is a known eclipsing system with a 4.4 day period from ASAS-SN data. We calculate absolute visual magnitudes for all three stars to be between -7 and -6, which is consistent with our expectations of these subtypes. These discoveries highlight the incompleteness of the WR census in our local volume of the Milky Way and suggest the potential for future Galactic WR discoveries from Gaia low-dispersion spectra. Furthermore, radial velocity studies of the newly found binary will provide direct mass estimates and orbital parameters, adding to our knowledge of the role that binarity plays in massive star evolution.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented Central Engine "Breathing" Phenomenon in an Active Supermassive Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving the inner structures of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provides the "standard ruler" to measure the parallax distances of the Universe and a powerful way to weigh supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Thanks to time-domain observations, it is possible to use the reverberation mapping (RM) technique to measure time delays between different light curves that probe the structures of the SMBH accretion disks and broad line regions (BLRs), which are otherwise often too compact to be spatially resolved for most AGNs. Despite decades of RM studies, the critical physical process that controls the structures of SMBH accretion disk and BLR and their temporal evolution remains unclear. Here we report the variation of the SMBH accretion disk structure of NGC 4151 in response to changes in luminosity within 6 years. In the high-flux state, the time delays measured from our continuum RM with high-cadence (2 days) spectroscopy are 3.8 times larger than that in the low-flux state and 15 times longer than the classical standard thin disk (SSD) prediction. This result provides the first piece of direct evidence that the SMBH disk structure "breathes" in highly-variable AGN manifestations. The time-delay change severely challenges the popular X-ray reprocessing of the SSD model, with or without BLR contributions. More importantly, the continuum time delays can be comparable with the time delay between the broad Hb line and the nearby optical continuum, and the latter is commonly used to calculate the BLR sizes. Hence, the BLR sizes are significantly underestimated if the continuum time delays are not properly considered. This underestimation introduces up to 0.3 dex systematic uncertainties on RM SMBH masses and BLR parallax distances. Our findings underscore that simultaneous continuum and BLR RM studies are vital for better deciphering the SMBH mass growth and the cosmological expansion history.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Alignments and Spin Correlations of [OII] Emitters at $z=1.2$ and $z=1.5$ from HSC Narrow-band Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies are known to be aligned toward specific directions within the large-scale structure. Such alignment signals become important for controlling the systematics of weak lensing surveys and for constraining galaxy formation and evolution scenarios. We measure the galaxy-ellipticity and ellipticity-ellipticity correlation functions for blue star-forming galaxies at $z=1.19$ and $z=1.47$ that are selected by detecting [OII] emission lines in narrow-band filters of the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. Assuming that disk galaxies are thin and rotation-supported, we also measure the spin correlation function by estimating spin directions with ellipticities and position angles. Above $1 \; h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, we do not find significant signals for galaxy-ellipticity, ellipticity-ellipticity, or spin correlations at both redshifts. Below $1 \; h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, a weak deviation from zero is seen at $z=1.47$, implying weak spin-filament correlations, but it is not verified by the direct comparison between angles of spins and filaments. The linear alignment model fit yields the amplitude parameter $A_{\rm NLA}=1.38\pm2.32$ at $z=1.19$ and $0.45\pm2.09$ at $z=1.47$ ($95\%$ confidence levels). We discuss various observational and physical origins that affect the search for alignments of disk galaxies at high redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outcome of the formation of massive stars is an important anchor point in their evolution. It provides insight into the physics of the assembly process, and sets the conditions for stellar evolution. We characterize a population of 18 highly reddened O4.5 to B9 stars in the very young massive star-forming region M17. Their properties allow us to identify the empirical location of the ZAMS, and rotation and mass-loss rate of stars there. We performed quantitative spectroscopic modeling of VLT/X-shooter spectra using NLTE atmosphere code Fastwind and fitting approach Kiwi-GA. The observed SEDs were used to determine the line-of-sight extinction. From a comparison of their positions in the HRD with MIST evolutionary tracks, we inferred the stellar masses and ages. We find an age of $0.4_{-0.2}^{+0.6}$ Myr for our sample, however we also identify a strong relation between the age and the mass of the stars. The extinction towards the sources ranges from $A_V = 3.6$ to 10.6. Stars more massive than 10 M$_{\odot}$ have reached the ZAMS. Their projected ZAMS spin rate distribution extends to 0.3 of the critical velocity; their mass-loss rates agree with those of other main-sequence OB stars. Stars with a mass in the range $3 &lt; M/$M$_{\odot} &lt; 7$ are still on the pre-main sequence (PMS). Evolving their $v \sin i$ to the ZAMS yields values up to $\sim 0.6 v_{\rm crit}$. For PMS stars without disks, we find tentative mass-loss rates up to $10^{-8.5}\,$M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$. We constrain the empirical location of the ZAMS for massive ($10 &lt; M/$M$_{\odot} &lt; 50$) stars. The ZAMS rotation rates for intermediate-mass stars are twice as high as for massive stars, suggesting that the angular momentum gain processes differ between the two groups. The relation between the age and mass of the stars suggests a lag in the formation of more massive stars relative to lower mass stars.</description>

      <title>Connecting stellar and galactic scales: Energetic feedback from stellar wind bubbles to supernova remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy and momentum feedback from stars is a key element of models for galaxy formation and interstellar medium dynamics, but resolving the relevant length scales to directly include this feedback remain out of reach of current-generation simulations. We aim to constrain the energy feedback by winds, photoionisation and supernovae (SNe) from massive stars. We measure the thermal and kinetic energy imparted to the interstellar medium on various length scales, calculated from high-resolution 1D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Our grid of simulations covers a broad range of densities, metallicities, and state-of-the-art evolutionary models of single and binary stars. We find that a single star or binary system can carve a cavity of tens-of-pc size into the surrounding medium. During the pre-SN phase, post-main-sequence stellar winds and photoionisation dominate. While SN explosions dominate the total energy budget, the pre-SN feedback is of great importance by reducing the circumstellar gas density and delaying the onset of radiative losses in the SN remnant. Contrary to expectations, the metallicity dependence of the stellar wind has little effect on the cumulative energy imparted by feedback to the ISM; the only requirement is the existence of a sufficient level of pre-SN radiative and mechanical feedback. The ambient medium density determines how much and when feedback energy reaches to distance $\gtrsim 10-20$ pc and affects the division between kinetic and thermal feedback. Our results can be used as a sub-grid model for feedback in large-scale simulations of galaxies. The results reinforce that the uncertain mapping of stellar evolution sequences to SN explosion energy is very important to determining the overall feedback energy from a stellar population.</description>

      <title>Galaxy clustering at cosmic dawn from JWST/NIRCam observations to redshift z$\sim$11</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function at cosmic dawn, using photometrically-selected sources from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The JWST/NIRCam dataset comprises approximately $N_g \simeq 7000$ photometrically-selected Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), spanning in the redshift range $5\leq z&lt;11$. The primary objective of this study is to extend clustering measurements beyond redshift $z&gt;10$, finding a galaxy bias $b=9.6\pm1.7$ for the sample at $\overline{z} = 10.6$. The result suggests that the observed sources are hosted by dark matter halos of approximately $M_{h}\sim 10^{10.6}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, in broad agreement with theoretical and numerical modelling of early galaxy formation during the epoch of reionization. Furthermore, the JWST JADES dataset enables an unprecedented investigation of clustering of dwarf galaxies two orders of magnitude fainter than the characteristic $L_*$ luminosity (i.e. with $M_{F200W}\simeq-15.8$) during the late stages of the epoch of reionization at $z\sim 6$. By analyzing clustering as a function of luminosity, we find that $b(M_{F200W})$ aligns with previous results for brighter galaxies and then decreases with $M_{F200W}$, as theoretically expected for fainter candidates. These initial results demonstrate the potential for further quantitative characterisation of the interplay between assembly of dark matter and light during cosmic dawn that the growing samples of JWST observations are enabling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultraviolet continuum traces young stars while the near-infrared unveils older stellar populations and dust-obscured regions. Balmer emission lines provide insights on gas properties and young stellar objects but are highly affected by dust attenuation. The near-infrared Paschen lines suffer less dust attenuation and can be used to measure star formation rates (SFRs) in star-forming regions obscured by dust clouds. We select 13 sources between redshifts 1 and 3 observed with HST, JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec based on the availability of at least one Balmer and one Paschen line with S/N &gt; 5. With a newly-developed version of CIGALE, we fit their hydrogen line equivalent widths (EWs) and photometric data. We assess the impacts of the removal of spectroscopic data by comparing the quality of the fits of the spectro-photometric data to those with photometric data only. We compare the single (BC03) vs binary (BPASS) stellar populations models in the fitting process of spectro-photometric data. We derive the differential attenuation and explore different attenuation recipes by fitting spectro-photometric data with BC03. For each stellar model and for each input dataset (with and without EWs), we quantify the deviation on the SFRs and stellar masses from the "standard" choice. On average, the SFRs are overestimated and the stellar masses are underestimated when EWs are not included as input data. We find a major contribution of the H${\alpha}$ emission line to the broadband photometric measurements of our sources, and a trend of increasing contribution with specific SFR. Using the BPASS models has a significant impact on the derived SFRs and stellar masses. We show that a flexible attenuation recipe provides more accurate estimates of the dust attenuation parameters, especially the differential attenuation which agrees with the original value of Charlot &amp; Fall (2000).</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI detections of H$\alpha$ and [O III] and direct metallicity measurement of the $z=10.17$ lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early universe. Covering wavelengths up to $5.3\,{\rm \mu m}$, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical emission lines H$\alpha$ out to $z = 7$ and [O III] to $z = 9.5$. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI MRS IFU observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647$-$JD at $z = 10.165$. With exposure times of 4.2 hours in each of two bands, we detect H$\alpha$ at $9\sigma$, [O III]$\,\lambda5008$ at $11\sigma$, and [O III]$\,\lambda4960$ at $3\sigma$. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yields seven emission lines including the auroral line [O III]$\,\lambda4363$, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a $z &gt; 10$ galaxy: $12+{\rm log(O/H)}= 7.79\pm0.09$, or $0.13^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,Z_{\odot}$. This is similar to galaxies at $z \sim 4 - 9$ with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate ${\rm log(sSFR / yr^{-1})} = -7.4 \pm 0.3$. We further constrain the ionization parameter ${\rm log}(U)$ = $-1.9 \pm 0.1$, ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})$ = $25.3\pm0.1$, and star formation rate $5.0\pm0.6\,M_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$ within the past $10\,{\rm Myr}$. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first $500$ million years.</description>

Abstract: Observations with the Gaia satellite have confirmed that the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way are not distributed as homogeneously as expected. The same occurs in galaxies such as Andromeda and Centaurus A, where satellite galaxies around their host galaxies have been observed to have orbits aligned perpendicular to the galactic plane of the host galaxy. This problem is known for the Milky Way as Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). The Scalar Field Dark Matter Field (SFDM), also known as Ultralight-, Fuzzy-, BEC-, Axion-dark matter, proposes dark matter is a scalar field, which in the non-relativistic limit follows the Schr\"odinger equation coupled to the Poisson equation. Although the SF here is classical, the Schr\"odinger equation contains a ground and excited states as part of its nature. In this work, we show that such quantum character of the SFDM can naturally explain the VPOS observed in galaxies. By taking into account the finite temperature corrections for a complex, self-interacting SF at very early epochs of the Universe, we show that with the ground and first excited states in the Newtonian limit, we can fit the rotation curves of the galaxies. With the best-fit parameters obtained, we can explain the VPOS. We do this with particular galaxies, such as the Milky Way, Andromeda, Centaurus A, and six other galaxies whose satellites have been observed. This result shows that the multistate SFDM is not distributed homogeneously around the galaxy, and therefore might explain the anisotropic distribution of the satellite galaxies. According to this result, this could be a general characteristic of the galaxies in the Universe. Finally, we also show how the scale of each galaxy depends on a parameter that is determined by the final temperature of the SF of the galaxy halo under study. This explains why different galaxies with SFDM give different values of the mass of the SF.</description>

      <title>A Big Red Dot: Scattered light, host galaxy signatures and multi-phase gas flows in a luminous, heavily reddened quasar at cosmic noon</title>

Abstract: We present a deep X-Shooter rest-frame UV to optical spectral analysis of the heavily reddened quasar, ULASJ2315+043 at z=2.566, known to reside in a major-merger host galaxy. The rest-frame optical is best-fit by a dust-reddened quasar E(B-V)_QSO = 1.55 with black-hole mass log10(Hbeta, MBH [M_sol]) = 10.26 +\- 0.05, bolometric luminosity L_Bol = 10^48.16 erg s^-1 and Eddington-scaled accretion rate log10(\lambda_Edd) = -0.19. We find remarkable similarities between ULASJ2315+043 and the high-redshift Little Red Dots (LRDs). The rest-frame UV cannot be explained by a dusty quasar component alone and requires an additional blue component consistent with either a star-forming host galaxy or scattered AGN light. We detect broad high-ionisation emission lines in the rest-UV, supporting the scattered light interpretation for the UV excess. The scattering fraction represents just 0.05% of the total luminosity of ULASJ2315+043. Analysis of the mid infra-red SED suggests an absence of hot dust on torus-scales similar to what is observed for LRDs. The obscuring medium is therefore likely on galaxy scales. We detect narrow, blueshifted associated absorption line systems in CIV, NV, SiIV and SiIII. There is evidence for significant high-velocity (&gt;1000 km s^-1) outflows in both the broad and narrow line regions as traced by CIV and [OIII] emission. The kinetic power of the [OIII] wind is e_ion = 10^44.61 erg s^-1 ~ 0.001 L_Bol. ULASJ2315+043 is likely in an important transition phase where star formation, black-hole accretion and multi-phase gas flows are simultaneously occurring.</description>

      <title>AGN jet-inflated bubbles as possible origin of odd radio circles</title>

Abstract: Odd radio circles (ORCs) are newly discovered extragalactic radio objects with unknown origin. In this work, we carry out three-dimensional cosmic-ray (CR) magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code and predict the radio morphology of end-on active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet-inflated bubbles considering hadronic emission. We consider CR proton (CRp)-dominated jets as they tend to inflate oblate bubbles, promising to reproduce the large inferred sizes of the ORCs when viewed end-on. We find that powerful and long-duration CRp-dominated jets can create bubbles with similar sizes ($\sim 300-600$ kpc) and radio morphology (circular and edge-brightened) to the observed ORCs in low-mass ($M_{\rm vir}\sim 8\times 10^{12} - 8\times 10^{13}~M_\odot$) halos. Given the same amount of input jet energy, longer-duration (thus lower-power) jets tend to create larger bubbles since high-power jets generate strong shocks that carry away a significant portion of the jet energy. The edge-brightened feature of the observed ORCs is naturally reproduced due to efficient hadronic collisions at the interface between the bubbles and the ambient medium. We further discuss the radio luminosity, X-ray detectability, and the possible origin of such strong AGN jets in the context of galaxy evolution. We conclude that end-on CR-dominated AGN bubbles could be a plausible scenario for the formation of ORCs.</description>

      <title>AtLAST Science Overview Report</title>

Abstract: Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities. In this report we summarise the science that is guiding the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). We demonstrate how tranformational advances in topics including star formation in high redshift galaxies, the diffuse circumgalactic medium, Galactic ecology, cometary compositions and solar flares motivate the need for a 50m, single-dish telescope with a 1-2 degree field of view and a new generation of highly multiplexed continuum and spectral cameras. AtLAST will have the resolution to drastically lower the confusion limit compared to current single-dish facilities, whilst also being able to rapidly map large areas of the sky and detect extended, diffuse structures. Its high sensitivity and large field of view will open up the field of submillimeter transient science by increasing the probability of serendipitous detections. Finally, the science cases listed here motivate the need for a highly flexible operations model capable of short observations of individual targets, large surveys, monitoring programmes, target of opportunity observations and coordinated observations with other observatories. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned submillimeter observatories.</description>
