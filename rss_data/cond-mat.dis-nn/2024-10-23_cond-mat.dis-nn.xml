      <title>Exploring Metallic-Insulating Transition and Thermodynamic Applications of Fibonacci Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended and critical states are two common phenomena in Fibonacci quasicrystals. In this paper, we first reveal the difference between the extended phase and the critical phase in the extended-critical Fibonacci quasicrystal from the perspectives of quantum transport and Wigner distribution. The transport conductance indicates that the extended-critical transition resembles a metallic-insulating transition. Moreover, the Wigner distributions show that the Wigner distribution of the extended wave function is localized in the momentum direction of the phase space, while that of the critical wave function is sub-extended in the momentum direction of the phase space. Based on the results of entanglement entropy, the extended-critical transition is a thermodynamic phase transition because it is accompanied by decreasing entropy. We engineer a quantum heat cycle engine with the extended-critical quasicrystal as the working medium, and find that there are rich working modes in the engine, such as quantum accelerator, quantum heater and quantum heat engine.
  Importantly, the extended quasicrystals are more conducive to the realization of quantum heat engines, while the critical quasicrystals are more conducive to the realization of quantum heaters. Our work is an important step toward exploring the rich thermodynamic applications of Fibonacci quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Triplets of local minima in a high-dimensional random landscape: correlations, clustering, and memoryless activated jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the distribution of triplets of stationary points in the energy landscape of the spherical p-spin model, by evaluating the quenched three-point complexity by means of the Kac-Rice formalism. We show the occurrence of transitions in the organization of stationary points in the landscape, identifying regions where local minima and saddles accumulate and cluster around other stationary points, thus displaying the presence of correlations in the landscape. We discuss the implications of these findings for the dynamical exploration of the energy landscape in the activated regime, specifying conditions under which transitions between local minima are expected to exhibit correlated rates and when, conversely, activated jumps are likely to be memoryless.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a variational Ansatz based on neural networks to the problem of spin-$1/2$ fermions in a harmonic trap interacting through a short distance potential. We showed that standard machine learning techniques lead to a quick convergence to the ground state, especially in weakly coupled cases. Higher couplings can be handled efficiently by increasing the strength of interactions during "training".</description>

      <title>New geometric receipts for design of photonic crystals and metamaterials: optimal toric packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design of photonic crystals having large bandgaps above a prescribed band is a well-known physical problem with many applications. A connection to an interesting mathematical construction was pointed out some time ago: it had been conjectured that optimal structures for gaps between bands n and n+1 correspond, in case of transverse magnetic polarisation, to rods located at the generators of centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), and in case of transverse electric polarisation to the walls of this tessellation. We discover another mathematical receipt which produces even better solutions: optimal packing of discs in square and triangular tori. It provides solutions qualitatively different from CVT, sometimes increasing the resulting bandgap size in several times. We therefore introduce two new classes of periodic structures with remarkable properties which may find applications in many other areas of modern solid state physics: arrays of particles located at the centers of optimally packed discs on tori, and nets corresponding to the walls of their Voronoi tessellations.</description>

      <title>Fragile spin liquid in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent appearance of the trillium lattice in the search for materials hosting spin liquids, we study the ground state of the classical Heisenberg model on its linegraph, the trilline lattice. We find that this network realises the recently proposed notion of a fragile spin liquid in three dimensions. Additionally, we analyze the Ising case and argue for a possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase in the corresponding quantum dimer model. Like the well-known $U(1)$ spin liquids, the classical phase hosts moment fractionalisation evidenced in the diluted lattice, but unlike these, it exhibits exponential decay both in spin correlations and interactions between fractionalised moments. This provides the first instance of a purely short-range correlated classical Heisenberg spin liquid in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Locating Information in Large Language Models via Random Matrix Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become central to AI applications, gaining a deeper understanding of their inner workings is increasingly important. In this work, we analyze the weight matrices of pretrained transformer models -- specifically BERT and Llama -- using random matrix theory (RMT) as a zero-information hypothesis. While randomly initialized weights perfectly agree with RMT predictions, deviations emerge after training, allowing us to locate learned structures within the models. We identify layer-type specific behaviors that are consistent across all blocks and architectures considered. By pinpointing regions that deviate from RMT predictions, we highlight areas of feature learning and confirm this through comparisons with the activation covariance matrices of the corresponding layers. Our method provides a diagnostic tool for identifying relevant regions in transformer weights using only the trained matrices. Additionally, we address the ongoing debate regarding the significance of small singular values in the context of fine-tuning and alignment in LLMs. Our findings reveal that, after fine-tuning, small singular values play a crucial role in the models' capabilities, suggesting that removing them in an already aligned transformer can be detrimental, as it may compromise model alignment.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization of elementary excitations in disordered binary Bose mixtures: Effects of the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum and thermal corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the Anderson localization of quasiparticles in binary Bose mixtures in the presence of the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum and thermal corrections subjected to correlated disordered potentials. We calculate the density profiles, the Bogoliubov quasiparticles modes, and the localization length in both the mixture and droplet phases. We show that for one-dimensional speckle potentials, the peculiar interplay of disorder and the Lee-Huang-Yang fluctuations may enhance localization in one component while inducing delocalization in the other. Our results reveal also that thermal fluctuations lead to the emergence of two and multiple localization maxima. In the droplet state, our findings uncover that the Anderson localization of quasiparticles is weak in the flat-top region since its excitation modes are restricted to those below the particle-emission threshold.</description>

      <title>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_\mathrm{op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. Our contributions are twofold. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions becomes exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish for the first time that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the typical semicircle law. Our proofs rely on deriving concentration inequalities and large deviation properties for the law of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints, extending results in the literature and offering insights of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Positive oscillating magnetoresistance in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In all van der Waals layered antiferromagnetic semiconductors investigated so far a negative magnetoresistance has been observed in vertical transport measurements, with characteristic trends that do not depend on applied bias. Here we report vertical transport measurements on layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$ that exhibit a drastically different behavior, namely a strongly bias dependent, positive magnetoresistance that is accompanied by pronounced oscillations for devices whose thickness is smaller than 10 nm. We establish that this unexpected behavior originates from transport being space-charge limited, and not injection limited as for layered antiferromagetic semiconductors studid earlier. Our analysis indicates that the positive magnetoresistance and the oscillations only occur when electrons are injected into in-gap defect states, whereas when electrons are injected into the conduction band the magnetoresistance vanishes. We propose a microscopic explanation for the observed phenomena that combines concepts typical of transport through disordered semiconductors with known properties of the CrPS$_4$ magnetic state, which captures all basic experimental observations. Our results illustrate the need to understand in detail the nature of transport through vdW magnets, to extract information about the nature of the order magnetic states and its microscopic properties.</description>

      <title>Disordered charge density waves in the kagome metal FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe has prompted interest in the interplay between kagome physics, CDW, and magnetism. However, a crucial aspect for understanding these emergent phenomena-the precise CDW structure-remains ambiguous. Recent studies have assumed uniformly distributed Ge dimers, but this assumption is problematic. The predicted band structure based on this model exhibits an abrupt disappearance of a Ge-$p$ band in the Fermi surface, contradicting experimental observations from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In this study, we propose that a CDW phase with disordered Ge dimers can reconcile theoretical predictions with ARPES results. This model reproduces the observed CDW gaps while preserving the Ge-$p$ band. Depending on experimental conditions, Ge dimers can be randomly distributed or exhibit phase separation from pristine regions. Our findings reveal the crucial role of Ge dimer disorder in the FeGe CDW and suggest potential implications of this disorder for other properties, such as magnetism and transport, in this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statics of the Fredrickson-Andersen model (FAM) of the liquid-glass transition is solved on the Bethe lattice (BL). The kinetic constraints of the FAM imply on the BL an ergodicity-breaking transition to a (glassy) phase where a fraction of spins of the system is permanently blocked, and the remaining "free" spins become non-trivially correlated. We compute several observables of the ergodicity-broken phase, such as the self-overlap, the configurational entropy and the spin-glass susceptibility, and we compare the analytical predictions with numerical experiments. The cavity equations that we obtain allow to define algorithms for fast equilibration and accelerated dynamics. We find that at variance with spin-glass models, the correlations inside a state do not exhibit a critical behavior.</description>

Abstract: Feature-learning deep nets progressively collapse data to a regular low-dimensional geometry. How this phenomenon emerges from collective action of nonlinearity, noise, learning rate, and other choices that shape the dynamics, has eluded first-principles theories built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. We exhibit a noise-nonlinearity phase diagram that identifies regimes where shallow or deep layers learn more effectively. We then propose a macroscopic mechanical theory that reproduces the diagram, explaining why some DNNs are lazy and some active, and linking feature learning across layers to generalization.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation for networks of coupled oscillators: Inferring unknown model parameters from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the state and unknown parameters of a network of coupled oscillators, such as neurons in the brain, is of utmost importance. This task is made harder when only partial and noisy observations are available, which is a typical scenario in realistic high-dimensional systems. The general task of inference falls under data assimilation, and a commonly used assimilation method is the Ensemble Kalman Filter. Employing network-specific localization of the forecast covariance, an Ensemble Kalman Filter with state space augmentation is shown to yield highly accurate estimates of both the oscillator phases and unknown model parameters in the case where only a subset of oscillator phases are observed. In contrast, standard data assimilation methods yield poor results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for Kuramoto oscillators and for networks of theta neurons, using a variety of network topologies.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-assisted study of directed percolation with spatial long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial L{\'{e}}vy-like flights are introduced as a way in the absorbing phase transitions to produce non-local interactions. We utilize the autoencoder, an unsupervised learning method, to predict the critical points for $(1+1)$-d directed percolation with such spatial long-range interactions. After making a global coverage of the reaction-diffusion distance and taking a series of different values for the parameter ${\beta}$ in the distribution $P(r){\sim}1/r^{\beta}$, the critical points $P_c$ that can be continuously varied are obtained. And the dynamic decay of the particle density under the critical points was counted as a way to determine the critical exponent ${\delta}$ of the survival rate. We also investigate the active behavior of the system's particles under the critical point with increasing time steps, which allows us to determine the characteristic time $t_f$ of the finite-scale systems. And the dynamic exponents $z$ are obtained using the scaling relation $t_f{\sim}L^{z}$. We find that the autoencoder can identify this characteristic evolutionary behavior of particles. Finally, we discuss the compliance of the scaling form $1/{\delta}-({\beta}-2)/{\delta}z=2$ in different ${\beta}$ intervals as well as a method to introduce a global scaling mechanism by generating a random walking step using the L{\'{e}}vy distribution.</description>

Abstract: On a global level, ecological communities are being perturbed at an unprecedented rate by human activities and environmental instabilities. Yet, we understand little about what factors facilitate or impede long-term persistence of these communities. While observational studies indicate that increased biodiversity must, somehow, be driving stability, theoretical studies have argued the exact opposite viewpoint instead. This encouraged many researchers to participate in the ongoing diversity-stability debate. Within this context, however, there has been a severe lack of studies that consider spatial features explicitly, even though nearly all habitats are spatially embedded. To this end, we study here the linear stability of meta-ecosystems on networks that describe how discrete patches are connected by dispersal between them. By combining results from random-matrix theory and network theory, we are able to show that there are three distinct features that underlie stability: edge density, tendency to triadic closure, and isolation or fragmentation. Our results appear to further indicate that network sparsity does not necessarily reduce stability, and that connections between patches are just as, if not more, important to consider when studying the stability of large ecological systems.</description>
