      <title>First Measurements of Black Hole Accretion and Radio-jet Timescales in a Young Quasar at the Edge of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study dedicated to measuring the timescales for black hole accretion and jet launch in a quasar at the edge of Reionization, PSO J352.4034-15.3373 at z = 5.832 $\pm$ 0.001. Previous work presented evidence of the strong radio synchrotron emission from the jet affecting the host galaxy dust-dominated continuum emission at $\nu_{\rm rest}=683$ GHz ($\nu_{\rm obs}=100$ GHz), implying a break in the synchrotron spectrum. In this work, we present quasi-simultaneous observations at 1.5\, GHz - 42\,GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and derive a frequency break at $\nu^{\rm break}_{\rm rest} = 196.46$ GHz ($\nu^{\rm break}_{\rm obs} = 28.76$ GHz). Modeling these observations, we calculate the jet spectral aging from the cooling of electrons to be $t_{\mathrm{spec}}\sim 580$ yr. From this measurement, we approximate the dynamical age $t_{\mathrm{dyn}}$ to be $\sim2,000$ yr, implying a recent jet ejection. We compare the jet timescale to the quasar's lifetime ($t_{\mathrm{Q}}$) that indicates the duration of the latest black hole accretion event and is derived from the proximity zone size in the rest-UV/optical spectrum. However, a ghostly Damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) system affects this measurement yielding an upper limit of $t_{\mathrm{Q}} \lesssim 10^4$ yr, consistent with the jet lifetime and indicative of a young quasar. This suggests that the triggering of a UV-bright quasar phase may occur within comparable timescales as the launch of a relativistic radio jet. Therefore, we may be witnessing an early stage of black hole and jet interactions in a quasar during the first gigayear of the universe.</description>

      <title>Universal fluctuation spectrum of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field arising due to particle noise in a quiescent Vlasov-Poisson plasma was derived in the 1960s. Here, we derive the universal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field, at Debye and sub-Debye scales, for a turbulent Vlasov-Poisson plasma. This spectrum arises from what is likely to be the final cascade - a universal regime to be encountered at the extreme small-scale end of any turbulent cascade in a nearly collisionless plasma. The cascaded invariant is $C_2$, the quadratic Casimir invariant of the particle distribution function. $C_2$ cascades to small scales in position and velocity space via linear and nonlinear phase mixing, in such a way that the time scales of the two processes are critically balanced at every scale. We construct a scaling theory of the fluctuation spectrum of $C_2$ and of the electric field in wavenumber space. The electric-field spectrum is sufficiently steep for the nonlinear mixing to be controlled by the largest-scale electric fields, and so the $C_2$ cascade resembles the Batchelor cascade of a passive scalar. Our theory is supported by simulations of a forced 1D-1V plasma. We predict that the cascade is terminated at the wavenumber where the turbulent electric-field spectrum gives way to the thermal noise spectrum. The time scale for this small-scale cutoff to be reached is the dynamical time of phase-space mixing times a logarithmic factor in the plasma parameter - this is the first concrete demonstration of this property of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence, akin to how fluid turbulence dissipates energy at a rate independent (or nearly independent) of molecular diffusion. In the presence of the sub-Debye phase-space cascade - a scenario that may be ubiquitous - standard collisional plasma theory ceases to be valid. This calls for the development of new collision operators suited to such turbulent environments.</description>

      <title>Early solar wind and dynamo magnetic field topology predictions for (16) Psyche and other asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroid (16) Psyche is a metal-rich body that might record an ancient coherent magnetization if some relict crust or mantle is preserved. Herein, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to predict (16) Psyche's field, assuming it has such relicts that were magnetized after nebula dispersal via one of two distinct pathways: i. an early solar wind-induced magnetization imparted after a larger body was impacted, forming the present-day asteroid and ii. a core dynamo magnetization imparted in an asteroid that is either presently largely intact or was a rubble pile. For pathway (i) we find the field to be predominantly dipolar and spin axis-aligned. For pathway (ii) we find the field to be either dipolar and spin axis-misaligned, or highly multipolar. Field topology and orientation may thus reveal key details of the nature and history of (16) Psyche, and our framework is broadly applicable to the study of magnetic fields from other asteroids.</description>
