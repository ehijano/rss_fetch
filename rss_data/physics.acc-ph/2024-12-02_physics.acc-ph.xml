      <title>Ground electron calibration of the Gamma-ray Transient Monitor onboard DRO-A Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gamma-Ray Transient Monitor (GTM) is an all-sky monitor onboard the Distant Retrograde Orbit-A (DRO-A) satellite, with the scientific objective of detecting gamma-ray bursts in the energy range of 20 keV to 1 MeV. The GTM is equipped with five Gamma-Ray Transient Probes (GTPs), utilizing silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillators for signal readout. To test the performance of the GTP in detecting electrons, we independently developed a continuous-energy-tunable, low-current, quasi-single-electron accelerator, and used this facility for ground-based electron calibration of the GTP. This paper provides a detailed description of the operational principles of the unique electron accelerator and comprehensively presents the process and results of electron calibration for the GTP. The calibration results indicate that the dead time for normal signals is less than 4 $\mu$s, while for overflow signals, it is approximately 70 $\mu$s, consistent with the design specifications. The GTP's time-recording capability is working correctly, accurately recording overflow events. The GTP responds normally to electrons in the 0.4-1.4 MeV energy range. The ground-based electron calibration validates the design of the GTP and enhances the probe's mass model, laying the foundation for payload development, in-orbit observation strategies, and scientific data analysis.</description>

      <title>Preparing Fermilab to Carry Out the P5 Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past several years, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) has suffered a number of troublesome setbacks. In some cases, failures to respond effectively have only made things worse, resulting in the current crisis atmosphere at the laboratory. This is reflected in part in the poorly rated performance appraisals (or PEMP) that the DOE provides to the lab every year. Three entities are currently responsible for supporting, managing, operating, and leading the lab: the Department of Energy (DOE), Fermi Research Alliance (FRA), and the Laboratory Director Office. Two recent events provide opportunities for interested parties to reverse the recent decline: the release in December 2023 of the P5 Report and the DOE decision to rebid the Management &amp; Operating (M&amp;O) contract. The P5 Report a decadal update of recommendations for US particle physics, includes an ambitious and positive roadmap for projects and activities at Fermilab. Carrying out the P5 plan successfully, however, will also require addressing many of the other problems currently besetting the lab. The selection of a new M&amp;O contractor is under the responsibility of the Deputy Director for Operations of the DOE Office of Science Dr. Juston Fontaine. A new M&amp;O Contractor would replace FRA and name a new Director effective January 1, 2025. A new management team, one hopes, would be motivated to solve problems and would enjoy a honeymoon period, enabling them to make positive changes more easily. Stimulated by these recent developments, the authors of this document, all present or past employees, convened confidentially in order to collect testimonials on a series of events symptomatic of the lab problems, to provide constructive criticism and offer possible solutions. This document summarizes this work.</description>

      <title>Towards Agentic AI on Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As particle accelerators grow in complexity, traditional control methods face increasing challenges in achieving optimal performance. This paper envisions a paradigm shift: a decentralized multi-agent framework for accelerator control, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed among autonomous agents. We present a proposition of a self-improving decentralized system where intelligent agents handle high-level tasks and communication and each agent is specialized to control individual accelerator components.
  This approach raises some questions: What are the future applications of AI in particle accelerators? How can we implement an autonomous complex system such as a particle accelerator where agents gradually improve through experience and human feedback? What are the implications of integrating a human-in-the-loop component for labeling operational data and providing expert guidance? We show three examples, where we demonstrate the viability of such architecture.</description>
