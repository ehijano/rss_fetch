      <title>Well-posedness of the higher-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a finite interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the local Hadamard well-posedness of a certain third-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a multi-term linear part and a general power nonlinearity known as the higher-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, formulated on a finite interval with a combination of nonzero Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Specifically, for initial and boundary data in suitable Sobolev spaces that are related to one another through the time regularity induced by the equation, we prove the existence of a unique solution as well as the continuous dependence of that solution on the data. The precise choice of solution space depends on the value of the Sobolev exponent and is dictated both by the linear estimates associated with the forced linear counterpart of the nonlinear initial-boundary value problem and, in the low-regularity setting below the Sobolev algebra property threshold, by certain nonlinear estimates that control the Sobolev norm of the power nonlinearity. In particular, as usual in Schr\"odinger-type equations, in the case of low regularity it is necessary to derive Strichartz estimates in suitable Lebesgue/Bessel potential spaces. The proof of well-posedness is based on a contraction mapping argument combined with the linear estimates, which are established by employing the explicit solution formula for the forced linear problem derived via the unified transform of Fokas. Due to the nature of the finite interval problem, this formula involves contour integrals in the complex Fourier plane with corresponding integrands that contain differences of exponentials in their denominators, thus requiring delicate handling through appropriate contour deformations. It is worth noting that, in addition to the various linear and nonlinear results obtained for the finite interval problem, novel time regularity results are established here also for the relevant half-line problem.</description>

      <title>Local Exact Controllability to Stationary Solutions of a Semilinear Parabolic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the local exact controllability of the quasilinear porous media equation with Dirichlet boundary condition.\\ Consider the equation $$\begin{aligned} &amp;y_t - \Delta a(y) = mu+f \text{ on } Q\\ &amp;y(0)=y_0,\ y \mid_{\Sigma} = 0 \end{aligned}$$ on the $n+1$-dimensional cylinder $Q = \Omega \times (0, T)$ with lateral boundary $\Sigma = \partial \Omega \times (0, T)$. The exact controllability in finite time is proved when $\|y_0 - y_s\|_{W^{1, n}_0(\Omega) \cap C(\overline \Omega)}$ is sufficiently small, $n &gt; 1$, for every stationary solution $y_s$ such that $a(y_s) \in W^{2, q}(\Omega)$, where $q&gt;n$. It is assumed that $\Omega$ is a bounded open set with $C^2$ boundary and that $a \in C^2(\mathbb R)$, $a'&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>$L^q$ Estimates on the Restriction of Schr\"odinger Eigenfunctions with singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider eigenfunction estimates in $L^p$ for Schr\"odinger operators, $H_V=-\Delta_g+V(x)$, on compact Riemannian manifolds $(M, g)$. Eigenfunction estimates over the full manifolds were already obtained by Sogge \cite{Sogge1988concerning} for $V\equiv 0$ and the first author, Sire, and Sogge \cite{BlairSireSogge2021Quasimode}, and the first author, Huang, Sire, and Sogge \cite{BlairHuangSireSogge2022UniformSobolev} for critically singular potentials $V$. For the corresponding restriction estimates for submanifolds, the case $V\equiv 0$ was considered in Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov \cite{BurqGerardTzvetkov2007restrictions}, and Hu \cite{Hu2009lp}. In this article, we will handle eigenfunction restriction estimates for some submanifolds $\Sigma$ on compact Riemannian manifolds $(M, g)$ with $n:=\dim M\geq 2$, where $V$ is a singular potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an unconventional overdetermined problem through a property of concavity, which provides some characterizations of balls via Brunn-Minkowski inequalities. In this setting, our rsults can be viewed as the generalization of $p$-capacity in [14], which have its own interest.</description>

      <title>On well-posedness for parabolic Cauchy problems of Lions type with rough initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a complete picture for well-posedness of parabolic Cauchy problems with time-independent, uniformly elliptic, bounded measurable complex coefficients. We exhibit a range of $p$ for which tempered distributions in homogeneous Hardy--Sobolev spaces $\dot{H}^{s,p}$ with regularity index $s \in (-1,1)$ are initial data. Source terms of Lions' type lie in weighted tent spaces, and weak solutions are built with their gradients in weighted tent spaces as well. A similar result can be achieved for initial data in homogeneous Besov spaces $\dot{B}^{s}_{p,p}$.</description>

      <title>Weighted Hardy-Rellich type inequalities: improved best constants and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying the weighted Hardy-Rellich inequality in $L^2$ with the full gradient replaced by the radial derivative the best constant becomes trivially larger or equal than in the first situation. Our contribution is to determine the new sharp constant and to show that for some part of the weights is strictly larger than before. In some cases we emphasize that the extremals functions of the sharp constant are not radially symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a nonlinear nonlocal eigenvalue problem involving the sum of fractional $(p,q)$-Laplace operators $(-\Delta)_p^{s_1}+(-\Delta)_q^{s_2}$ with $s_1,s_2\in (0,1)$; $p,q\in(1,\infty)$ and subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions in an open bounded set of $\mathbb{R}^N$. We prove bifurcation results from trivial solutions and from infinity for the considered nonlinear nonlocal eigenvalue problem. We also show the existence of multiple solutions of the nonlinear nonlocal problem using variational methods.</description>

      <title>Poisson kernel and blow-up of the second derivatives near the boundary for Stokes equations with Navier boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the explicit Poisson kernel of Stokes equations in the half space with nonhomogeneous Navier boundary condition (BC) for both infinite and finite slip length. By using this kernel, for any $q&gt;1$, we construct a finite energy solution of Stokes equations with Navier BC in the half space, with bounded velocity and velocity gradient, but having unbounded second derivatives in $L^q$ locally near the boundary. While the Caccioppoli type inequality of Stokes equations with Navier BC is true for the first derivatives of velocity, which is proved by us in [CPAA 2023], this example shows that the corresponding inequality for the second derivatives of the velocity is not true. Moreover, we give an alternative proof of the blow-up using a shear flow example, which is simple and is the solution of both Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the local well-posednesss for the Cauchy problem of a $N$-peakon system in the sense of Hadamard in both critical Besov spaces and supercritical Besov spaces. Second, we gain a blow-up criterion. According to blow-up criterion wemreach a precise blow-up criterion. Under a sign condition, we reach the existence of global solution. Finally, based on the first-order difference method, we give a simulation example of the blow-up of the equation and the properties of the global solution.</description>

      <title>Sharp local Bernstein estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on local growth properties of Laplace eigenfunctions on a compact Riemannian manifold. The principal theme is that a Laplace eigenfunction behaves locally as a polynomial function of degree proportional to the square root of the eigenvalue. In this direction, we notably prove sharp local Bernstein estimates, conjectured by Donnelly and Fefferman in 1990.</description>

      <title>Variational analysis of nonlocal Dirichlet problems in periodically perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a family of non local functionals of convolution-type depending on a small parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $\Gamma$-converging to local functionals defined on Sobolev spaces as $\varepsilon\to 0$. We study the asymptotic behaviour of the functionals when the order parameter is subject to Dirichlet conditions on a periodically perforated domains, given by a periodic array of small balls of radius $r_\delta$ centered on a $\delta$--periodic lattice, being $\delta &gt; 0$ an additional small parameter and $r_\delta=o(\delta)$. We highlight differences and analogies with the local case, according to the interplay between the three scales $\varepsilon$, $\delta$ and $r_\delta$. A fundamental tool in our analysis turns out to be a non local variant of the classical Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality in Sobolev spaces which may be of independent interest and useful for other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider non-negative, weak solutions to the doubly nonlinear parabolic equation $$ \partial_t u^q-\mbox{div}(|Du|^{p-2}Du)=0 $$ in the super-critical fast diffusion regime $0&lt;p-1&lt;q&lt;\frac{N(p-1)}{(N-p)_+}$. We show that when solutions vanish continuously at the Lipschitz boundary of a parabolic cylinder $\Omega_T$, they satisfy proper Carleson estimates. Assuming further regularity for the boundary of the domain $\Omega_T$, we obtain a power-like decay at the boundary and a boundary Harnack inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the existence in the sense of sequences of solutions for a certain integro-differential type problem involving the logarithmic Laplacian. The argument is based on the fixed point technique when such equation contains the operator without the Fredholm property. It is established that, under the reasonable technical conditions, the convergence in L^1(R^d) of the integral kernels yields the existence and convergence in L^2(R^d) of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Free boundary problems for the two-dimensional Euler equations in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present some classification results for the steady Euler equations in two-dimensional exterior domains with free boundaries. We prove that, in an exterior domain, if a steady Euler flow devoid of interior stagnation points adheres to slip boundary conditions and maintains a constant norm on the boundary, along with certain additional conditions at infinity, then the domain is the complement of a disk, and the flow is circular, namely the streamlines are concentric circles. Additionally, we establish that in the entire plane, if all the stagnation points of a steady Euler flow coincidentally form a disk, then, under certain additional reasonable conditions near the stagnation points and at infinity, the flow must be circular. The proof is based on a refinement of the method of moving planes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the sharp constants for the fractional Sobolev inequalities associated with the conformally invariant fractional powers $\mathcal{L}_{s}(0&lt;s&lt;1)$ of the sublaplacian on H-type groups. From these inequalities we derive a sharp log-Sobolev inequality by considering a limiting case and a sharp Sobolev trace inequality. The later extends to this context the result of Frank, Gonz\'alez, Monticelli and Tan (Adv. Math, 2015).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with inverse-power potential \[iu_{t} +\Delta u-c|x|^{-a}u=\pm |x|^{-b} |u|^{\sigma } u,\;\;(t,x)\in \mathbb R\times\mathbb R^{d},\] where $d\in \mathbb N$, $c\in \mathbb R$, $a,b&gt;0$ and $\sigma&gt;0$. First, we establish the local well-posedness in the fractional Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb R^d)$ with $s\ge 0$ by using contraction mapping principle based on the Strichartz estimates in Sobolev-Lorentz spaces. Next, the global existence and blow-up of $H^1$-solution are investigated. Our results extend the known results in several directions.</description>

      <title>A concentration-compactness principle for perturbed isoperimetric problems with general assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Derived from the concentration-compactness principle, the concept of generalized minimizer can be used to define generalized solutions of variational problems which may have components ``infinitely'' distant from each other. In this article and under mild assumptions we establish existence and density estimates of generalized minimizers of perturbed isoperimetric problems.

      <title>Approximation of $L^\infty$ functionals with generalized Orlicz norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to deal with the asymptotics of generalized Orlicz norms when the lower growth rate tends to infinity. $\Gamma$-convergence results and related representation theorems in terms of $L^\infty$ functionals are proven for sequences of generalized Orlicz energies under mild convexity assumptions. This latter hypothesis is removed in the variable exponent setting.</description>

      <title>KPP fronts in shear flows with cut-off reaction rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effect of a shear flow which has, without loss of generality, a zero mean flow rate, on a Kolmogorov--Petrovskii--Piscounov (KPP) type model in the presence of a discontinuous cut-off at concentration $u = u_c$. Its structure and speed of propagation depends on $A$ (the strength of the flow relative to the propagation speed in the absence of advection) and $B$ (the square of the front thickness relative to the channel width). We use matched asymptotic expansions to approximate the propagation speed in the three natural cases $A\to \infty$, $A\to 0$ and $A=O(1)$, with particular associated orderings on $B$, whilst $u_c\in(0,1)$ remains fixed. In all the cases that we consider, the shear flow enhances the speed of propagation in a manner that is similar to the case without cut-off ($u_c=0$). We illustrate the theory by evaluating expressions (either directly or through numerical integration) for the particular cases of the plane Couette and Poiseuille flows.</description>

      <title>Higher differentiability for the fractional $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the higher differentiability of solutions to the inhomogeneous fractional $p$-Laplace equation under different regularity assumptions on the data. In the superquadratic case, we extend and sharpen several previous results, while in the subquadratic regime our results constitute completely novel developments even in the homogeneous case. In particular, in the local limit our results are consistent with well-known higher differentiability results for the standard inhomogeneous $p$-Laplace equation. All of our main results remain valid in the vectorial context of fractional $p$-Laplace systems.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$ Poisson-Neumann problem and its relation to the Neumann problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the $L^p$ Poisson-Neumann problem for an uniformly elliptic operator $L=-\rm{div }A\nabla$ in divergence form in a bounded 1-sided Chord Arc Domain $\Omega$, which considers solutions to $Lu=h-\rm{div}\vec{F}$ in $\Omega$ with zero Neumann data on the boundary for $h$ and $\vec F$ in some tent spaces. We give different characterizations of solvability of the $L^p$ Poisson-Neumann problem and its weaker variants, and in particular, we show that solvability of the weak $L^p$ Poisson-Neumann probelm is equivalent to a weak reverse H\"older inequality. We show that the Poisson-Neumman problem is closely related to the $L^p$ Neumann problem, whose solvability is a long-standing open problem. We are able to improve the extrapolation of the $L^p$ Neumann problem from Kenig and Pipher by obtaining an extrapolation result on the Poisson-Neumann problem.</description>

      <title>Maximal regularity for fractional difference equations with finite delay on UMD space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $\ell^p$-maximal regularity for the fractional difference equation with finite delay: \begin{equation*} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
  \Delta^{\alpha}u(n)=Au(n)+\gamma u(n-\lambda)+f(n), \ n\in \mathbb N_0, \lambda \in \mathbb N, \gamma \in \mathbb R;
  u(i)=0,\ \ i=-\lambda, -\lambda+1,\cdots, 1, 2,
  \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $A$ is a bounded linear operator defined on a Banach space $X$, $f:\mathbb N_0\rightarrow X$ is an $X$-valued sequence and $2&lt;\alpha&lt;3$. We introduce an operator theoretical method based on the notion of $\alpha$-resolvent sequence of bounded linear operators, which gives an explicit representation of solution. Further, using Blunck's operator-valued Fourier multipliers theorems on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z}; X)$, we completely characterize the $\ell^p$-maximal regularity of solution when $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and $X$ is a UMD space.</description>

      <title>On open book analogs of quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum graphs have become in this century a favorite playground for mathematicians, mathematical physicists, and chemists, due to their manifold applications as models of thin structures, as well as presenting sometimes simpler playground for hard higher dimensional problems.
  It was clear from some applications that thin surface structures (looking as stratified varieties) also arise, for instance in photonic crystals theory and dynamical systems. However, both justification and studying of these models is much harder and very little progress has been made by now. The goal of this note is to set down some basic notions and results for such structures.
  The name ``open book'' has been used for such geometric structures in topology and comes from an image of several smooth $n$-dimensional ``pages'' bound to an $(n-1)$- dimensional ``binding.''</description>

      <title>Prescribed mean curvature problems on homogeneous vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a detailed and systematic study of weak (singular) Hermite-Einstein structures on homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles over rational homogeneous varieties. We use standard tools from spectral geometry, Harmonic analysis, and Cartan's highest weight theory to provide a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier series and intersection numbers under which an $L^{2}$-function can be realized as mean curvature of a singular Hermitian structure on an irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle. We prove that the condition provided is necessary and sufficient for functions that belong to certain interpolation spaces. In the particular case of line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type, we describe explicitly in terms of representation theory the solutions of the underlying geometric PDE. Also, we establish a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier coefficients and intersection numbers for solvability and convergence of the weak Hermite-Einstein flow on irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles. As an application of our methods, we describe the first explicit examples in the literature of solutions to several geometric flows, including Donaldson's heat flow, Yang-Mills heat flow, and the gradient flow of Donaldson's Lagrangian, on line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. Additionally, we show that every polynomial central charge function gives rise to a weak Donaldson's Lagrangian $\mathcal{M}$. In the particular case of irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles, we prove that the gradient flow of $\mathcal{M}$ converges to a Hermitian structure which is, up to a gauge transformation, a $Z$-critical Hermitian structure in the large volume limit.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive decay estimates near isolated singularities of 3-dimensional (3d) Yang-Mills-Higgs fields defined on a fiber bundle, where the fiber space is a compact Riemannian manifold and the structure group is a connected compact Lie group. As an application, we obtain removable singularity theorems for 3d Yang-Mills-Higgs fields under different types of energy conditions, which generalizes classical removable singularity theorems for 3d Yang-Mills fields~\cite{S84,SS84} and 3d harmonic maps~\cite{L85}.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the spatial discretization of the strongly nonlinear Lefever-Lejeune partial differential equation defines a nonlinear lattice that is physically relevant in the context of the nonlinear physics of ecosystems, modelling the dynamics of vegetation densities in dry lands. We study the system in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is especially relevant because of its natural dimension for the emergence of pattern formation. Theoretical results identify parametric regimes for the system that distinguish between extinction and potential convergence to non-trivial states. Importantly, we analytically identify conditions for Turing instability, detecting thresholds on the discretization parameter for the manifestation of this mechanism. Numerical simulations reveal the sharpness of the analytical conditions for instability and illustrate the rich potential for pattern formation even in the strongly discrete regime, emphasizing the importance of the interplay between higher dimensionality and discreteness.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative orbital stability of stochastic patterns in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic perturbations of PDEs which have special pattern solutions, such as (nonlinear) travelling waves, solitons, and spiral waves. We show orbital stability of these patterns on a timescale which is exponential in the inverse square of the noise amplitude. We systematically treat equations with noncommutative symmetry groups, and show how the noncommutativity affects the motion of the pattern. This is done by introducing a new method to track the (generalized) phase of the pattern. Furthermore, we demonstrate how orbital stability arises from a mismatch of symmetry between the pattern and the equation. Our phase tracking method does not rely on a Hilbert space structure. This allows us to show stability in general Banach spaces, and to treat noise with lower regularity than before.</description>

For any initial curve lying merely in the energy space we show existence and parabolic smoothing of the solution. Applying previous results on long time existence and proving a constrained Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality we furthermore show convergence to a critical point as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Curvature Estimate of Nodal Sets of Harmonic Functions in the Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09022v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study curvature estimates for nodal sets of harmonic functions in the plane. We prove that at any point $p$, the curvature of any nodal curve of a harmonic function $u$ is upper bounded by
  $$
  \left\vert \kappa(u)(p)\right\vert\leq \frac{4(n+1)}{nr},
  $$
  where $u$ has only $n$ nodal curves in $B_r(p)$ intersecting at $p$. This result is sharp for odd $n$, and the extreme case can be given by Dirac measure and its derivatives. For even $n$, we prove there exists a smaller sharp upper bound. Moreover, we can prove the curvature of any nodal curve is upper bounded at every point in the nodal set of $u$ in a small neighborhood $B_{cr}(p)$, where $c&lt;1$ depends only on $n$. Furthermore, with the tool of the frequency, we can prove the positive part and the negative part of $u$ have uniform lower bound, which depends only on the number of the nodal domains in $B_r(p)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider rigidity properties of steady Euler flows in two-dimensional bounded domains. We prove that steady Euler flows in a disk with exactly one interior stagnation point and tangential boundary conditions must be circular flows, which confirms a conjecture proposed by F. Hamel and N. Nadirashvili in [J. Eur. Math. Soc., 25 (2023), no. 1, 323-368]. Moreover, for steady Euler flows on annuli with tangential boundary conditions, we prove that they must be circular flows provided there is no stagnation point inside, which answers another open problem proposed by F. Hamel and N. Nadirashvili in the same paper. We secondly show that the no-slip boundary conditions would result in absolute rigidity in the sense that except for the disks (\emph{resp}. annuli), there is no other smooth simply (\emph{resp}. doubly) connected bounded domain on which there exists a steady flow with only one (\emph{resp}. no) interior stagnation point and no-slip boundary conditions, and if present on the other hand, the flow must be circular. The arguments are based on the geometry of streamlines and 'local' symmetry properties for the non-negative solutions of semi-linear elliptic problems.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of solutions to a model of sexual populations structured in phenotypes. The model features a nonlinear integral reproduction operator derived from the Fisher infinitesimal operator and a trait-dependent selection term. The reproduction operator describes here the inheritance of the mean parental traits to the offspring without variability. We show that, under assumptions on the growth of the selection rate, Dirac masses are stable around phenotypes for which the difference between the selection rate and its minimum value is less than 1/2. Moreover, we prove the convergence in some Fourier-based distance of the centered and rescaled solution to a stationary profile under some conditions on the initial moments of the solution.</description>

Abstract: We establish generalised fractional boundary Hardy-type inequality, in the spirit of Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality for different values of $s$ and $p$ on various domains in $\mathbb{R}^d, d \geq 1$. In particular, for Lipschitz bounded domains any values of $s$ and $p$ are admissible, settling all the cases in sub critical, super critical and critical regime. In this paper we have solved the open problems posed by Dyda for the critical case $sp =1$. Moreover we have proved the embeddings of $W^{s,p}_{0}(\Omega)$ in subcritical, critical and supercritical uniformly without using Dyda's decomposition. Additionally, we extend our results to include a weighted fractional boundary Hardy-type inequality for the critical case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the 2D free boundary incompressible Euler equations with surface tension, where the fluid domain is periodic in $x_1$, and has finite depth. We construct initial data with a flat free boundary and arbitrarily small velocity, such that the gradient of vorticity grows at least double-exponentially for all times during the lifespan of the associated solution. This work generalizes the celebrated result by Kiselev--{\v{S}}ver{\'a}k to the free boundary setting. The free boundary introduces some major challenges in the proof due to the deformation of the fluid domain and the fact that the velocity field cannot be reconstructed from the vorticity using the Biot-Savart law. We overcome these issues by deriving uniform-in-time control on the free boundary and obtaining pointwise estimates on an approximate Biot-Savart law.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the planar Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system \begin{equation*}\begin{cases} -\Delta u + V(x) u + \phi u = b|u|^{p-2} u \ &amp;\text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{2},\\\Delta \phi= u^{2} &amp;\text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{2},\end{cases} \end{equation*} where $b \geq 0$, $p &gt; 2 $ and $V \in C(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R})$ is a potential function with $\inf_{\mathbb{R}^2} V &gt;0$. Suppose moreover that $V$ exhibits a bounded potential well in the sense that $\lim_{|x|\rightarrow \infty} V(x)$ exists and is equal to $\sup_{\mathbb{R}^2} V$. By using variational methods, we obtain the existence of ground state solutions for this system in the case where $p \geq 3$. Furthermore, we also present a minimax characterization of ground state solutions. The main feature of this work is that we do not assume any periodicity or symmetry condition on the external potential $V$, which is essential to establish the compactness condition of Cerami sequences.</description>

Abstract: We consider a parabolic equation whose coefficients are Log-Lipschitz continuous in $t$ and Lipschitz continuous in $x$. Combining a recent conditional stability result with a well posed variational problem, we reconstruct the initial condition of an unknown solution from a rough measurement at the final time.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard system with dynamic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general class of bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard systems with dynamic boundary conditions. In contrast to classical Neumann boundary conditions, the dynamic boundary conditions of Cahn--Hilliard type allow for dynamic changes of the contact angle between the diffuse interface and the boundary, a convection-induced motion of the contact line as well as absorption of material by the boundary. The coupling conditions for bulk and surface quantities involve parameters $K,L\in[0,\infty]$, whose choice declares whether these conditions are of Dirichlet, Robin or Neumann type. We first prove the existence of a weak solution to our model in the case $K,L\in (0,\infty)$ by means of a Faedo--Galerkin approach. For all other cases, the existence of a weak solution is then shown by means of the asymptotic limits, where $K$ and $L$ are sent to zero or to infinity, respectively. Eventually, we establish higher regularity for the phase-fields, and we prove the uniqueness of weak solutions given that the mobility functions are constant.</description>

      <title>Ground states of planar Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson systems with an unbounded potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with a class of planar Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson systems, namely, $-\Delta u+V(x)u+\frac{\gamma}{2\pi}\bigl(\log(|\cdot|)\ast|u|^{2}\bigr)u=b|u|^{p-2}u\ \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{2}$, where $\gamma &gt; 0$, $b \geq 0$, $p&gt;2$ and $V \in C(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R})$ is an unbounded potential function with $\inf_{\mathbb{R}^2} V &gt;0$. Suppose moreover that the potential $V$ satisfies $\left|\{x \in \mathbb{R}^2:\: V(x)\leq M\}\right| &lt; \infty$ for every $M&gt;0$, we establish the existence of ground state solutions for this system via variational methods. Furthermore, we also explore the minimax characterization of ground state solutions. Our main results can be viewed as a counterpart of the result from Molle and Sardilli (Proc. Edinb. Math. Soc. 65:1133-1146, 2022), where the authors studied the existence of ground state solutions for the above planar Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system in the case where $b&gt;0$ and $p &gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Transverse Magnetic ENZ Resonators: Robustness and Optimal Shape Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study certain "geometric-invariant resonant cavitie"' introduced by Liberal et. al in a 2016 Nature Comm. paper, modeled using the transverse magnetic reduction of Maxwell's equations. The cross-section consists of a dielectric inclusion surrounded by an "epsilon-near-zero" (ENZ) shell. When the shell has the right area, its interaction with the inclusion produces a resonance. Mathematically, the resonance is a nontrivial solution of a 2D divergence-form Helmoltz equation $\nabla \cdot \left(\varepsilon^{-1}(x,\omega) \nabla u \right) + \omega^2 \mu u = 0$, where $\varepsilon(x,\omega)$ is the (complex-valued) dielectric permittivity, $\omega$ is the frequency, $\mu$ is the magnetic permeability, and a homogeneous Neumann condition is imposed at the outer boundary of the shell. This is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, since $\varepsilon$ depends on $\omega$. Use of an ENZ material in the shell means that $\varepsilon(x,\omega)$ is nearly zero there, so the PDE is rather singular. Working with a Lorentz model for the dispersion of the ENZ material, we put the discussion of Liberal et.~al.~on a sound foundation by proving the existence of the anticipated resonance when the loss is sufficiently small. Our analysis is perturbative in character despite the apparently singular form of the PDE. While the existence of the resonance depends only on the area of the ENZ shell, the rate at which it decays depends on the shape of the shell. We consider an associated optimal design problem: what shape shell gives the slowest-decaying resonance? We prove that if the dielectric inclusion is a ball then the optimal shell is a concentric annulus. For an inclusion of any shape, we study a convex relaxation of the design problem using tools from convex duality, and discuss the conjecture that our relaxed problem amounts to considering homogenization-like limits of nearly optimal designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonexistence results for positive supersolutions of the equation $$-Lu=u^p\quad\text{in $\mathbb R^N_+$}$$ are obtained, $-L$ being any symmetric and stable linear operator, positively homogeneous of degree $2s$, $s\in(0,1)$, whose spectral measure is absolutely continuous and positive only in a relative open set of the unit sphere of $\mathbb R^N$. The results are sharp: $u\equiv 0$ is the only nonnegative supersolution in the subcritical regime $1\leq p\leq\frac{N+s}{N-s}\,$, while nontrivial supersolutions exist, at least for some specific $-L$, as soon as $p&gt;\frac{N+s}{N-s}$. \\ The arguments used rely on a rescaled test function's method, suitably adapted to such nonlocal setting with weak diffusion; they are quite general and also employed to obtain Liouville type results in the whole space.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the incompressible Euler equations describing a stably stratified ocean, reformulated in isopycnal coordinates. Our motivation for using this reformulation is twofold: first, its quasi-2D structure renders some parts of the analysis easier. Second, it closes a gap between the analysis performed in the paper by Bianchini and Duch{\^e}ne in 2022 in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity but with a regularizing term, and the analysis performed in the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020 in Eulerian coordinates, without any regularizing term but without shear velocity. Our main result is an energy estimate in Sobolev spaces on the system in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity, without any regularizing term. With additional assumptions, it is uniform in the shallow-water parameter. The main difficulty consists in transposing to the isopycnal reformulation the symmetric structure of the system which is more straightforward in Eulerian coordinates.</description>

Abstract: We completely characterize the weighted Lebesgue spaces on the torus $\mathbb T^n$ and waveguide manifold $\mathbb T^n \times \mathbb R^m$ for which the solutions of the heat equation converge pointwise (as time tends to zero) to the initial data. In the process, we also characterize the weighted Lebesgue spaces for the boundedness of maximal operators on the torus and waveguide manifold, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantitative pointwise estimates of the cooling process for inelastic Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogeneous inelastic Boltzmann equation for hard spheres. We first prove that the solution $f(t,v)$ is pointwisely bounded from above by $C_{f_0}\langle t \rangle^3$ and establish that the cooling time is infinite $T_c = +\infty$ under the condition $f_0 \in L^1_2 \cap L^{\infty}_{s} $ for $s &gt; 2 $. Away from the zero velocity, we further prove that $f(t,v)\leq C_{f_0, \epsilon} \langle t \rangle $ for $|v| \geq \epsilon$ at any time $t &gt; 0 $ and $\epsilon&gt;0$. This time-growing pointwise upper-bound is natural in the cooling process, as we expect the density near $v = 0 $ to grow rapidly. As a consequence, via these results, we obtain Maxwellian upper-bounds of solutions for each time. Our upper-bounds hold for any constant normal restitution $ 0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1 $ and are uniform in $ \alpha$.</description>

      <title>Semilinear fractional elliptic PDEs with gradient nonlinearities on open balls: existence of solutions and probabilistic representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of viscosity solutions of fractional semilinear elliptic PDEs of index $\alpha \in (1,2)$ with polynomial gradient nonlinearities on $d$-dimensional balls, $d\geq 2$. Our approach uses a tree-based probabilistic representation of solutions and their partial derivatives using $\alpha$-stable branching processes, and allows us to take into account gradient nonlinearities not covered by deterministic finite difference methods so far. In comparison with the existing literature on the regularity of solutions, no polynomial order condition is imposed on gradient nonlinearities. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the accuracy of the method in dimension $d=10$, solving a challenge encountered with the use of deterministic finite difference methods in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>A moment approach for entropy solutions of parameter-dependent hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method to solve parameter-dependent hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a moment approach, based on a previous work from Marx et al. (2020). This approach relies on a very weak notion of solution of nonlinear equations, namely parametric entropy measure-valued (MV) solutions, satisfying linear equations in the space of Borel measures. The infinite-dimensional linear problem is approximated by a hierarchy of convex, finite-dimensional, semidefinite programming problems, called Lasserre's hierarchy. This gives us a sequence of approximations of the moments of the occupation measure associated with the parametric entropy MV solution, which is proved to converge. In the end, several post-treatments can be performed from this approximate moments sequence. In particular, the graph of the solution can be reconstructed from an optimization of the Christoffel-Darboux kernel associated with the approximate measure, that is a powerful approximation tool able to capture a large class of irregular functions. Also, for uncertainty quantification problems, several quantities of interest can be estimated, sometimes directly such as the expectation of smooth functionals of the solutions. The performance of our approach is evaluated through numerical experiments on the inviscid Burgers equation with parametrised initial conditions or parametrised flux function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, perturbed by a real-valued Wiener process. We add an external control to the effective field as an attempt to drive the magnetization to a desired state and also to control thermal fluctuations. We use the theory of Young measures to relax the given control problem along with the associated cost. We consider a control operator that can depend (possibly non-linearly) on both the control and the associated solution. Moreover, we consider a fairly general associated cost functional without any special convexity assumption. We use certain compactness arguments, along with the Jakubowski version of the Skorohod Theorem to show that the relaxed problem admits an optimal control.</description>

      <title>Closed mean curvature flows with asymptotically conical singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for any asymptotically conical self-shrinker, there exists an embedded closed hypersurface such that the mean curvature flow starting from it develops a singularity modeled on the given shrinker. The main technique is the Wa\.zewski box argument, used by Stolarski in the proof of the corresponding theorem in the Ricci flow case. As a corollary, our construction, combined with the works of Angenent-Ilmanen-Vel\'azquez and Chodosh-Daniels-Holgate-Schulze, implies the existence of fattening level set flows starting from smooth embedded closed hypersurfaces. This addresses a question posed by Evans-Spruck and De Giorgi.</description>
