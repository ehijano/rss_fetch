      <title>Nuclear rainbow of the symmetric nucleus-nucleus system: Interchange of the nearside and farside scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive elastic scattering data measured at energies around 10 to 20 MeV/nucleon for some identical systems, like 12C+12C and 16O+16O, exhibit the nuclear rainbow pattern of broad Airy oscillations of the cross section at medium and large angles. Due to the identity of the scattered projectile and recoiled target, the rainbow pattern at angles around and beyond $\theta_{\rm c.m.}\approx 90^\circ$ is strongly deteriorated by the boson exchange. The nuclear rainbow features in the identical-particles elastic scattering discussed so far are based on the nearside-farside (NF) decomposition of the scattering amplitude given by an optical model calculation neglecting the projectile-target exchange symmetry. Moreover, the NF decomposition method was developed in the 70s by Fuller for nonidentical systems only, and the details of how the exchange symmetry of an identical system affects the evolution of nuclear rainbow remain unexplored. Therefore, the Fuller method is generalized in this work for the elastic scattering of two identical (spin-zero) nuclei, with the projectile-target exchange symmetry taken explicitly into account. The results obtained for elastic 12C+12C and 16O+16O scattering at low energies show the exchange symmetry results in a symmetric interchange of the nearside and farside patterns at angles passing $\theta_{\rm c.m.}=90^\circ$, which requires a more subtle interpretation of nuclear rainbow. We also found that a similar NF interchange occurs in a nonidentical nucleus-nucleus system with the core-core symmetry, where the elastic cross section at backward angles is due mainly to the elastic transfer of cluster or nucleon between two identical cores. This interesting effect is illustrated in the elastic 16O+12C scattering at low energies where the elastic $\alpha$ transfer between two 12C cores has been proven to enhance the elastic cross section at backward angles.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Asymptotic Expansions of Quantum Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize in a novel manner the physical properties of the low temperature Fermi gas in the degenerate domain as a function of temperature and chemical potential. For the first time we obtain low temperature $T$ results in the domain where several fermions are found within a de Broglie spatial cell. In this regime, the usual high degeneracy Sommerfeld expansion fails. The other known semi-classical Boltzmann domain applies when fewer than one particle is found in the de Broglie cell. The relative errors of the three approximate methods (Boltzmann limit, Sommerfeld expansion, and the new domain of several particles in the de Broglie cell) are quantified. In order to extend the understanding of the Sommerfeld expansion, we developed a novel characterization of the Fermi distribution allowing the separation of the finite and zero temperature phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Geant4 photonuclear process is benchmarked by comparing it with experimental data to verify the ability of the Geant4 toolkit to simulate the photo-induced reaction on deformed nuclei in the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) region. The simulation results are compared with experimental data of the deformed nuclei (153Eu, 160Gd, 165Ho, and 186W) targets in terms of both the average neutron energies and the photonuclear cross-sections. The agreement between the calculated results of the Geant4 photonuclear process model and the experimental measurements is analyzed.</description>

      <title>BBN catalysis by doubly charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider primordial nucleosynthesis in the presence of hypothetical quasi-stable doubly charged particles. Existence of $X^{--}$ with macroscopic lifetimes will lead to the formation of its bound states with $^4$He and other light elements, significantly facilitating the subsequent formation of lithium nuclei. From observational constraints on maximum allowable amount of lithium, that we update in this work, we derive strong constraints on the abundance and lifetime of $X^{--}$. In a likely cosmological freeze-out scenario with temperatures initially exceeding the mass of $X^{--}$, the BBN constrains the lifetime of these particles to be less than about 100 seconds. For parametrically long lifetimes, lithium abundance data constrain $X^{--}$ abundance to be less than $10^{-9}$ relative to protons, regardless of whether these particles decay or remain stable. Stable particles could saturate the dark matter density only if their mass is comparable to or in excess of $10^{10}$ GeV, and most of $X^{--}$ will be found in bound states with beryllium nuclei, so that chemically they would appear as abnormally heavy helium isotopes.</description>

      <title>First Radial Excitations of Mesons and Diquarks in a Contact Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation for the masses of the first radially excited states of forty mesons and diquarks made up of $u,d,s,c$ and $b$ quarks, including states that contain one or both heavy quarks. To this end, we employ a combined analysis of the Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations within a self-consistent and symmetry preserving vector-vector contact interaction. The same set of parameters describe ground and excited states of mesons and their diquark partners. The wave-function of the first radial excitation contains a zero whose location is correlated with an additional parameter $d_F$ which is a function of dressed quark masses. Our results satisfy the equal spacing rules given by the Gell-Mann Okubo mass relations. Wherever possible, we make comparisons of our findings with known experimental observations as well as theoretical predictions of several other models and approaches including lattice quantum chromodynamics, finding a very good agreement. We report predictions for a multitude of radial excitations not yet observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing generalised parton distributions from the lattice off-forward Compton amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a determination of the structure functions of the off-forward Compton amplitude $\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\mathcal{E}_1$ from the Feynman-Hellmann method in lattice QCD. At leading twist, these structure functions give access to the generalised parton distributions (GPDs) $H$ and $E$, respectively. This calculation is performed for an unphysical pion mass of $m_{\pi}=412\;\text{MeV}$ and four values of the soft momentum transfer, $t\approx 0, -0.3, -0.6, -1.1\;\text{GeV}^2$, all at a hard momentum scale of $\bar{Q}^2\approx 5\;\text{GeV}^2$. Using these results, we test various methods to determine properties of the real-time scattering amplitudes and GPDs: (1) we fit their Mellin moments, and (2) we use a simple GPD ansatz to reconstruct the entire distribution. Our final results show promising agreement with phenomenology and other lattice results, and highlight specific systematics in need of control.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of critical fluctuations in hadronic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical phenomena in phase transitions of strongly interacting matter, governed by quantum chromodynamics, are inherently encoded in the fluctuations of conserved charges. In this work, we study the net-baryon number density fluctuations, including the lowest-lying nucleon and the baryonic resonance $\Delta(1232)$, based on the parity doublet model in the mean-field approximation. We focus on the qualitative features of the second-order susceptibility of the net-baryon number density in dense hadronic matter and how the inclusion of $\Delta(1232)$ affects it. We demonstrate that the fluctuations of the individual baryons do not necessarily reflect the total net-baryon number fluctuations at finite density, due to the non-trivial correlations between different particle species. Our results highlight the role of baryonic correlations in the interpretation of data from heavy ion collision experiments.</description>

      <title>Solar fusion III: New data and theory for hydrogen-burning stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. Each of the relevant reactions of solar and quiescent stellar hydrogen burning is reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.</description>

      <title>Steady electric currents in magnetized QCD and their use for the equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the emergence of steady electric currents in QCD as a response to a non-uniform magnetic background using lattice simulations with 2 + 1 quark flavors at the physical point, as well as leading-order chiral perturbation theory. Using these currents, we develop a novel method to determine the leading-order coefficient of the equation of state in a magnetic field expansion: the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD medium. We decompose the current expectation value into valence- and sea-quark contributions and demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the electric current is captured by the valence term alone, allowing for a comparably cheap determination of the susceptibility. Our continuum extrapolated lattice results for the equation of state confirm the findings of some of the existing studies in the literature, namely that the QCD medium behaves diamagnetically at low and paramagnetically at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Steps Toward Quantum Simulations of Hadronization and Energy-Loss in Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of particles in dense matter using quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: According to the Color Glass Condensate approach to relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the earliest phase of the collision is a glasma which is made of highly populated gluon fields that can be treated classically. Using a proper time expansion we study analytically various properties of the glasma. In particular, we compute the glasma energy-momentum tensor which allows us to obtain the energy density, longitudinal and transverse pressure, collective flow, and angular momentum. We also study the role of the glasma in jet quenching by computing collisional energy loss and transverse momentum broadening.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we first derive the evolution equation for the general energy-momentum moment of $\delta f$, where $\delta f$ is the deviation from the local equilibrium phase space density. We then introduce a relativistic extension of regularized hydrodynamics developed in the non-relativistic case by Struchtrup and Torrilhon that combines the method of moments and Chapman-Enskog expansion. Hydrodynamic equations up to the third-order in gradients are then systematially derived within the context of a single species system and the relaxation time approximation. This is followed by a series of linear stability and causality analysis. For the system of massless particles without any charge conservation, the third-order hydrodynamics is shown to be linearly stable and causal.</description>

Abstract: Using effective Lagrangians constrained by the heavy quark spin symmetry and chiral symmetry, for the light quarks, we analyze the $D^0 D^0\pi^+$, $\bar{D}^0D^0\pi^0$ and $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ invariant mass spectra. Performing a simultaneous analysis of the doubly charmed and charm-anti-charm states gives further insights into the nature of the $T^+_{cc}$ and $\chi^0_{c1}(3872)$, exotic hadrons. We find that both states lie below the respective $DD^*$/$D\bar{D}^*$ thresholds. Also, the contributions of the triangle and box diagrams are negligible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reliable determination of the pole parameters and residues of nucleon resonances is notoriously challenging, given the required analytic continuation into the complex plane. We provide a comprehensive analysis of such resonance parameters accessible with Roy-Steiner equations for pion-nucleon scattering - a set of partial-wave dispersion relations that combines the constraints from analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry - most prominently of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. Further, we study the Roper, $N(1440)$, resonance, which lies beyond the strict domain of validity, in comparison to Pad\'e approximants, comment on the role of subthreshold singularities in the $S$-wave, and determine the residues of the $f_0(500)$, $\rho(770)$, and $f_0(980)$ resonances in the $t$-channel process $\pi\pi\to\bar NN$. The latter allows us to test - for the first time fully model independently in terms of the respective residues - universality of the $\rho(770)$ couplings and the Goldberger-Treiman relation expected if the scalars behaved as dilatons, in both cases revealing large deviations from the narrow-resonance limit.</description>

      <title>Transversity generalized parton distributions in spin-3/2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The definitions of the quark and gluon transversity generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in spin-3/2 particles are obtained in the light-cone gauge. It is found that they contain 16 independent components for each parton. Their even or odd property is found in terms of skewness variable, and the odd transversity GPDs vanish in the forward limit. There are 16 amplitudes with helicity flip of quark or gluon. We conclude that all the amplitudes, unpolarized, polarized, and transversity amplitudes, have a common factor $F(\zeta)$ carrying all the complex part. Here, the variable $\zeta$ is the helicity difference $\zeta=(\lambda' -\lambda)-(\mu' - \mu)$ for the amplitude $\mathcal{A}_{\lambda' \mu',\lambda\mu}$. This kinematical factor is associated with the transfer of the orbital angular momentum in the quark- and gluon-spin-3/2 particle scattering amplitudes. We also derive another main physical quantity, transversity distribution, from the transversity GPDs in the forward limit for the spin-3/2 particles.</description>

Abstract: Generalized thermodynamic relations are introduced into the framework of a relativistic perfect spin hydrodynamics. They allow for consistent treatment of spin degrees of freedom, including the use of spin tensors whose structure follows from microscopic calculations. The obtained results are important for establishing consistency between different formulations of spin hydrodynamics and form the basis for introducing dissipative corrections.</description>
