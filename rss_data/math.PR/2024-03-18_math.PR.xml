      <title>Gaussian universality for approximately polynomial functions of high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an invariance principle for polynomial functions of $n$ independent high-dimensional random vectors, and also show that the obtained rates are nearly optimal. Both the dimension of the vectors and the degree of the polynomial are permitted to grow with $n$. Specifically, we obtain a finite sample upper bound for the error of approximation by a polynomial of Gaussians, measured in Kolmogorov distance, and extend it to functions that are approximately polynomial in a mean squared error sense. We give a corresponding lower bound that shows the invariance principle holds up to polynomial degree $o(\log n)$. The proof is constructive and adapts an asymmetrisation argument due to V. V. Senatov. As applications, we obtain a higher-order delta method with possibly non-Gaussian limits, and generalise a number of known results on high-dimensional and infinite-order U-statistics, and on fluctuations of subgraph counts.</description>

      <title>Applying affine urn models to the global profile of hyperrecursive trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inside the discipline of graph theory exists an extension known as the hypergraph. This generalization of graphs includes vertices along with hyperedges consisting of collections of two or more vertices. One well-studied application of this structure is that of the recursive tree, and we apply its framework within the context of hypergraphs to form hyperrecursive trees, an area that shows promise in network theory. However, when the global profile of these hyperrecursive trees is studied via recursive equations, its recursive nature develops a combinatorial explosion of sorts when deriving mixed moments for higher containment levels. One route to circumvent these issues is through using a special class of urn model, known as an affine urn model, which samples multiple balls at once while maintaining a structure such that the replacement criteria is based on a linear combination of the balls sampled within a draw.
  We investigate the hyperrecursive tree through its global containment profile, observing the number of vertices found within a particular containment level, and given a set of $k$ containment levels, relate its structure to that of a similar affine urn model in order to derive the asymptotic evolution of its first two mixed moments. We then establish a multivariate central limit theorem for the number of vertices for the first $k$ containment levels. We produce simulations which support our theoretical findings and suggest a relatively quick rate of convergence.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Dyson Brownian motions via the superposition principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilevel Dyson Brownian motions (MDBMs) combine Dyson Brownian motions of different dimensions into a single process in a canonical way. This paper completes the theory of MDBMs for $\beta\ge2$. Specifically, we use the superposition principle of Figalli and Trevisan to construct the MDBMs for all $\beta&gt;2$ in a unified manner. This also extends their stochastic differential equation representation, first discovered by Gorin and Shkolnikov, to all $\beta&gt;2$ and proves the uniqueness of the MDBMs for all $\beta&gt;2$. Finally, we show that their limit as $\beta\downarrow2$ is given by the $\beta=2$ MDBM, commonly referred to as the Warren process.</description>

      <title>Semigroup of annuli in Liouville CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conformal field theory, the semigroup of annuli with boundary parametrization plays a special role, in that it generates the whole algebra of local conformal symmetries, the so-called Virasoro algebra. The subgroup of elements $\mathbb{A}_f=\mathbb{D}\setminus f(\mathbb{D}^\circ)$ for contracting biholomorphisms $f:\mathbb{D}\to f(\mathbb{D})\subset \mathbb{D}^\circ$ with $f(0)=0$ is called the holomorphic semigroup of annuli. In this article, we construct a differentiable representation of the holomorphic semigroup into the space of bounded operators on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of Liouville Conformal Field Theory and show it generates under differentiation the positive Virasoro elements ${\bf L}_n,\tilde{{\bf L}}_n$ for $n\geq 0$. We also construct a projective representation of the semigroup of annuli in the space of bounded operators on $\mathcal{H}$ in terms of Segal amplitudes and show that all Virasoro elements ${\bf L}_n,\tilde{{\bf L}}_n$ for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ are generated by differentiation of these annuli amplitudes. Finally, we use this to show that the Segal amplitudes for Liouville theory are differentiable with respetc to their boundary parametrizations, and the differential is computed in terms of Virasoro generators. This paper will serve, in a forthcoming work, as a fundamental tool in the construction of the conformal blocks as globally defined holomorphic sections of a holomorphic line bundle on Teichmuller space and satisfying the Ward identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What distributions arise as the distribution of the distance between two typical points in some measured metric space? This seems to be a surprisingly subtle problem. We conjecture that every distribution with a density function whose support contains $0$ does arise in this way, and give some partial results in that direction.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Cutoff on the Multitype Configuration Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find Gaussian cutoff profiles for the total variation distance to stationarity of a random walk on a multiplex network: a finite number of directed configuration models sharing a vertex set, each with its own bounded degree distribution and edge probability. Further we consider the minimal total variation distance over this space of possible doubly stochastic edge probabilities at each point in time. Looking at all possible dynamics simultaneously on one realisation of the random graph, we find that this sequence of minimal distances converges in probability to the same cutoff profile as the chain with entropy maximising transition probabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the simple random walks in percolation clusters on hyperbolic groups, we show that the associated harmonic measures are exact dimensional and their Hausdorff dimensions are equal to the entropy over the speed. Our method is inspired by cluster relations introduced by Gaboriau and applies to a large class of random environments on the groups.</description>

      <title>The intertwining property for Laguerre processes with a fixed parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intertwining of Laguerre processes of parameter $\alpha$ in different dimensions.
  We introduce a Feller kernel that depends on $\alpha $ and intertwines the $\alpha$-Laguerre process in $N+1$ dimensions and that in $N$ dimensions.
  When $\alpha $ is a non-negative integer, the new kernel is interpreted in terms of the conditional distribution of the squared singular values: if the singular values of a unitarily invariant random matrix of order $(N+\alpha +1) \times (N+1)$ are fixed, then the those of its $(N+\alpha) \times N $ truncation matrix are given by the new kernel.</description>

      <title>Scale-free cascading failures: Generalized approach for all simple, connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascading failures, wherein the failure of one component triggers subsequent failures in complex interconnected systems, pose a significant risk of disruptions and emerge across various domains. Understanding and mitigating the risk of such failures is crucial to minimize their impact and ensure the resilience of these systems. In multiple applications, the failure processes exhibit scale-free behavior in terms of their total failure sizes. Various models have been developed to explain the origin of this scale-free behavior. A recent study proposed a novel hypothesis, suggesting that scale-free failure sizes might be inherited from scale-free input characteristics in power networks. However, the scope of this study excluded certain network topologies. Here, motivated by power networks, we strengthen this hypothesis by generalizing to a broader range of graph topologies where this behavior is manifested. Our approach yields a universal theorem applicable to all simple, connected graphs, revealing that when a cascade leads to network disconnections, the total failure size exhibits a scale-free tail inherited from the input characteristics. We do so by characterizing cascade sequences of failures in the asymptotic regime.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of heavy tailed nearly unstable INAR($\infty$) processes and rough fractional diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the scaling limit of heavy tailed unstable INAR($\infty$) processes where the $\ell^1$ norm of the kernel vector is close to $1$ and have power law tail of the form $n^{-(1+\alpha)}$, with $\alpha\in(\frac12,1)$. The result is in contrast to the continuous-time heavy tailed unstable Hawkes processes and light-tailed INAR($p$) processes. We show that the discrete-time scaling limit also has long-memory property and can also be seen as an integrated fractional Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of the paper is the following.
  Let a non-degenerate distribution have finite moments $\mu_k$ of all orders $k=0,1,2,\ldots$. Then the sequence $\{\mu_k/k!, \; k=0,1,2,\ldots\}$ either contains infinitely many different terms or at most three. In the latter case, this sequence has the form $\{1,a,1-b,a,1-b,a,1-b, \ldots\}$ and corresponds to a distribution with the characteristic function \begin{equation*}\label{ eq0}
  f(t)=\frac{1+iat+bt^2}{1+t^2}, \quad \text{where} \;\; b\geq 0,\; \frac{1-a-b}{2}\geq 0,\; \frac{1+a-b}{2}\geq 0.

      <title>Well-posedness of stochastic evolution equations with H\"older continuous noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show existence and pathwise uniqueness of probabilistically strong solutions to a pseudomonotone stochastic evolution problem on a bounded domain $D\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and random initial data $u_0\in L^2(\Omega;L^2(D))$. The main novelty is the presence of a merely H\"older continuous multiplicative noise term. In order to show the well-posedness, we simultaneously regularize the H\"older noise term by inf-convolution and add a perturbation by a higher order operator to the equation. Using a stochastic compactness argument we may pass to the limit and we obtain first a martingale solution. Then by a pathwise uniqueness argument we get existence of a probabilistically strong solution.</description>

Abstract: We provide a complex-analytic approach to the classification of positive stationary measures on $S^1$ with respect to complex finite Borel measures on $PSU(1,1)$ satisfying the finite first moment condition by studying their Poisson-like and Cauchy-like transforms from the perspective of generalized analytic continuation. This approach allows us to establish a functional-analytic criterion for singularity of a hitting measure for random walks on lattices in $PSU(1,1)$. In addition, this approach suggests alternative proofs to the several well-known related results by Furstenberg, Kaimanovich, Guivarc'h-le Jan and Bourgain, among several others.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Pricing and Matching for Two-Sided Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic system with multiple types of customers and servers. Each type of waiting customer or server joins a separate queue, forming a bipartite graph with customer-side queues and server-side queues. The platform can match the servers and customers if their types are compatible. The matched pairs then leave the system. The platform will charge a customer a price according to their type when they arrive and will pay a server a price according to their type. The arrival rate of each queue is determined by the price according to some unknown demand or supply functions. Our goal is to design pricing and matching algorithms to maximize the profit of the platform with unknown demand and supply functions, while keeping queue lengths of both customers and servers below a predetermined threshold. This system can be used to model two-sided markets such as ride-sharing markets with passengers and drivers. The difficulties of the problem include simultaneous learning and decision making, and the tradeoff between maximizing profit and minimizing queue length. We use a longest-queue-first matching algorithm and propose a learning-based pricing algorithm, which combines gradient-free stochastic projected gradient ascent with bisection search. We prove that our proposed algorithm yields a sublinear regret $\tilde{O}(T^{5/6})$ and queue-length bound $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. We further establish a tradeoff between the regret bound and the queue-length bound: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma/4})$ versus $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$ for $\gamma \in (0, 2/3].$</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based system reliability analysis with Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based reliability analysis methods have shown great advancements for their computational efficiency and accuracy. Recently, many efficient learning strategies have been proposed to enhance the computational performance. However, few of them explores the theoretical optimal learning strategy. In this article, we propose several theorems that facilitates such exploration. Specifically, cases that considering and neglecting the correlations among the candidate design samples are well elaborated. Moreover, we prove that the well-known U learning function can be reformulated to the optimal learning function for the case neglecting the Kriging correlation. In addition, the theoretical optimal learning strategy for sequential multiple training samples enrichment is also mathematically explored through the Bayesian estimate with the corresponding lost functions. Simulation results show that the optimal learning strategy considering the Kriging correlation works better than that neglecting the Kriging correlation and other state-of-the art learning functions from the literatures in terms of the reduction of number of evaluations of performance function. However, the implementation needs to investigate very large computational resource.</description>

      <title>Stochastic approach for elliptic problems in perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of applications in science and engineering involve a PDE model in a domain with perforations, such as perforated metals or air filters. Solving such perforated domain problems suffers from computational challenges related to resolving the scale imposed by the geometries of perforations. We propose a neural network-based mesh-free approach for perforated domain problems. The method is robust and efficient in capturing various configuration scales, including the averaged macroscopic behavior of the solution that involves a multiscale nature induced by small perforations. The new approach incorporates the derivative-free loss method that uses a stochastic representation or the Feynman-Kac formulation. In particular, we implement the Neumann boundary condition for the derivative-free loss method to handle the interface between the domain and perforations. A suite of stringent numerical tests is provided to support the proposed method's efficacy in handling various perforation scales.</description>

      <title>A supersymmetric quantum perspective on the explicit large deviations for reversible Markov jump processes, with applications to pure and random spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large deviations at various levels that are explicit for Markov jump processes satisfying detailed-balance are revisited in terms of the supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonian $H$ that can be obtained from the Markov generator via a similarity transformation. We first focus on the large deviations at level 2 for the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ of the configurations $C$ seen during a trajectory over the large time-window $[0,T]$ and rewrite the explicit Donsker-Varadhan rate function as the matrix element $I^{[2]}[{\hat p}(.) ] = \langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $ involving the square-root ket $\vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $. [The analog formula is also discussed for reversible diffusion processes as a comparison.] We then consider the explicit rate functions at higher levels, in particular for the joint probability of the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ and the empirical local activities ${\hat a}(C,C') $ characterizing the density of jumps between two configurations $(C,C')$. Finally, the explicit rate function for the joint probability of the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ and of the empirical total activity ${\hat A} $ that represents the total density of jumps of a long trajectory is written in terms of the two matrix elements $ \langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle$ and $\langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H^{off} \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $, where $H^{off} $ represents the off-diagonal part of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian $H$. This general formalism is then applied to pure or random spin chains with single-spin-flip or two-spin-flip transition rates, where the supersymmetric Hamiltonian $H$ correspond to quantum spin chains with local interactions involving Pauli matrices of two or three neighboring sites.</description>

      <title>Entrywise tensor-train approximation of large tensors via random embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of low-rank tensor-train approximation is well-understood when the approximation error is measured in the Frobenius norm. The entrywise maximum norm is equally important but is significantly weaker for large tensors, making the estimates obtained via the Frobenius norm and norm equivalence pessimistic or even meaningless. In this article, we derive a new, direct estimate of the entrywise approximation error that is applicable in such cases. Our argument is based on random embeddings, the tensor-structured Hanson--Wright inequality, and the core coherences of a tensor. The theoretical results are accompanied with numerical experiments: we compute low-rank tensor-train approximations in the maximum norm for two classes of tensors using the method of alternating projections.</description>

      <title>Nonconcave Robust Utility Maximization under Projective Determinacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a robust utility maximization problem in a general discrete-time frictionless market. The investor is assumed to have a random, nonconcave and nondecreasing utility function, which may or may not be finite on the whole real-line. She also faces model ambiguity on her beliefs about the market, which is modeled through a set of priors. We prove, using only primal methods, the existence of an optimal investment strategy when the utility function is also upper-semicontinuous. For that, we introduce the new notion of projectively measurable functions. We show basic properties of these functions as stability under sums, differences, products, suprema, infima and compositions but also assuming the set-theoretical axiom of Projective Determinacy (PD) stability under integration and existence of $\epsilon$-optimal selectors. We consider projectively measurable random utility function and price process and assume that the graphs of the sets of local priors are projective sets. Our other assumptions are stated on a prior-by-prior basis and correspond to generally accepted assumptions in the literature on markets without ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Numerical method for nonlinear Kolmogorov PDEs via sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine nonlinear Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs). Here the nonlinear part of the PDE comes from its Hamiltonian where one maximizes over all possible drift and diffusion coefficients which fall within a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of pre-specified baseline coefficients. Our goal is to quantify and compute how sensitive those PDEs are to such a small nonlinearity, and then use the results to develop an efficient numerical method for their approximation. We show that as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$, the nonlinear Kolmogorov PDE equals the linear Kolmogorov PDE defined with respect to the corresponding baseline coefficients plus $\varepsilon$ times a correction term which can be also characterized by the solution of another linear Kolmogorov PDE involving the baseline coefficients. As these linear Kolmogorov PDEs can be efficiently solved in high-dimensions by exploiting their Feynman-Kac representation, our derived sensitivity analysis then provides a Monte Carlo based numerical method which can efficiently solve these nonlinear Kolmogorov equations. We provide numerical examples in up to 100 dimensions to empirically demonstrate the applicability of our numerical method.</description>

      <title>An Optimal-Control Approach to Infinite-Horizon Restless Bandits: Achieving Asymptotic Optimality with Minimal Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt an optimal-control framework for addressing the undiscounted infinite-horizon discrete-time restless $N$-armed bandit problem. Unlike most studies that rely on constructing policies based on the relaxed single-armed Markov Decision Process (MDP), we propose relaxing the entire bandit MDP as an optimal-control problem through the certainty equivalence control principle. Our main contribution is demonstrating that the reachability of an optimal stationary state within the optimal-control problem is a sufficient condition for the existence of an asymptotically optimal policy. Such a policy can be devised using an "align and steer" strategy. This reachability assumption is less stringent than any prior assumptions imposed on the arm-level MDP, notably the unichain condition is no longer needed. Through numerical examples, we show that employing model predictive control for steering generally results in superior performance compared to other existing policies.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo on Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit, momentum-based dynamics for optimizing functions defined on Lie groups was recently constructed, based on techniques such as variational optimization and left trivialization. We appropriately add tractable noise to the optimization dynamics to turn it into a sampling dynamics, leveraging the advantageous feature that the momentum variable is Euclidean despite that the potential function lives on a manifold. We then propose a Lie-group MCMC sampler, by delicately discretizing the resulting kinetic-Langevin-type sampling dynamics. The Lie group structure is exactly preserved by this discretization. Exponential convergence with explicit convergence rate for both the continuous dynamics and the discrete sampler are then proved under W2 distance. Only compactness of the Lie group and geodesically L-smoothness of the potential function are needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence result for kinetic Langevin on curved spaces, and also the first quantitative result that requires no convexity or, at least not explicitly, any common relaxation such as isoperimetry.</description>

Abstract: We investigate analytical properties of free stable distributions and discover many connections with their classical counterparts. Our main result is an explicit formula for the Mellin transform, which leads to explicit series representations for the characteristic function and for the density of a free stable distribution. All of these formulas bear close resemblance to the corresponding expressions for classical stable distributions. As further applications of our results, we give an alternative proof of the duality law due to Biane and a new factorization of a classical stable random variable into an independent (in the classical sense) product of a free stable random variable and a power of a Gamma(2) random variable.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the R\'enyi entropy of independent sums of integer valued random variables through Fourier theoretic means, and give sharp comparisons between the variance and the R\'enyi entropy, for Poisson-Bernoulli variables. As applications we prove that a discrete ``min-entropy power'' is super additive on independent variables up to a universal constant, and give new bounds on an entropic generalization of the Littlewood-Offord problem that are sharp in the ``Poisson regime''.</description>

Abstract: We study the distributions of waiting times in variations of the negative binomial distribution of order $k$. One variation apply different enumeration scheme on the runs of successes. Another case considers binary trials for which the probability of ones is geometrically varying. We investigate the exact distribution of the waiting time for the $r$-th occurrence of success run of a specified length (non-overlapping, overlapping, at least, exactly, $\ell$-overlapping) in a $q$-sequence of binary trials. The main theorems are Type $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$ $q$-negative binomial distribution of order $k$ and $q$-negative binomial distribution of order $k$ in the $\ell$-overlapping case. In the present work, we consider a sequence of independent binary zero and one trials with not necessarily identical distribution with the probability of ones varying according to a geometric rule. Exact formulae for the distributions obtained by means of enumerative combinatorics.</description>

Abstract: From a mathematical and statistical point of view, a segment of a DNA strand can be viewed as a sequence of four-state (A, C, G, T) trials. We consider distributions of runs and patterns related to run lengths of multi-state sequences, especially for four states (A, B, C, D). Let $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots$ be a sequence of four state i.i.d.\ trials taking values in the set $\mathscr{S}=\{A,\ B,\ C,\ D\}$ of four symbols with probability $P(A)=P_{a}$, $P(B)=P_{b}$, $P(C)=P_{c}$ and $P(D)=P_{d},$ respectively. In this paper, we obtain exact formulae for the probability distribution function for runs of B's the discrete distribution of order $k$, longest run statistics, shortest run statistics, waiting time distribution and the distribution of run lengths.</description>

Abstract: We characterize weakly harmonic maps with respect to non-local Dirichlet forms by Markov processes and martingales. In particular, we can obtain discontinuous martingales on Riemannian manifolds from the image of symmetric stable processes under fractional harmonic maps in a weak sense. Based on this characterization, we also consider the continuity of weakly harmonic maps along the paths of Markov processes and describe the condition for the continuity of harmonic maps by quadratic variations of martingales in some situations containing cases of energy minimizing maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with the stochastic two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible fluids, set in a bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We consider additive noise in the form $G\, dW$, where $W$ is a cylindrical Wiener process and $G$ a bounded linear operator with range dense in the domain of $A^\gamma$, $A$ being the Stokes operator. While it is known that existence of invariant measure holds for $\gamma&gt;1/4$, previous results show its uniqueness only for $\gamma &gt; 3/8$. We fill this gap and prove uniqueness and strong mixing property in the range $\gamma \in (1/4, 3/8]$ by adapting the so-called Sobolevski\u{\i}-Kato-Fujita approach to the stochastic N-S equations. This method provides new \textit{a priori} estimates, which entail both better regularity in space for the solution and strong Feller and irreducibility properties for the associated Markov semigroup.</description>

Abstract: This paper uses convolutions of the gamma density and the one-sided stable density to construct higher level densities. The approach is applied to constructing a 4-parameter Mittag-Leffler density, whose Laplace transform is a corresponding Mittag-Leffler function, which is completely monotone (CM) by construction. Laplace transforms of mixtures of the stable densities with respect to the 4-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution are compositions of the Mittag-Leffler functions with Bernstein functions, thereby generating a rich family of CM variants of the base CM Mittag-Leffler functions, including known instances as special cases.</description>

Abstract: We study the expected utility maximization problem of a large investor who is allowed to make transactions on tradable assets in an incomplete financial market with endogenous permanent market impacts. The asset prices are assumed to follow a nonlinear price curve quoted in the market as the utility indifference curve of a representative liquidity supplier. We show that optimality can be fully characterized via a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) which corresponds to a non-linear backward stochastic partial differential equation (BSPDE). We show existence of solutions to the optimal investment problem and the FBSDEs in the case where the driver function of the representative market maker grows at least quadratically or the utility function of the large investor falls faster than quadratically or is exponential. Furthermore, we derive smoothness results for the existence of solutions of BSPDEs. Examples are provided when the market is complete or the utility function is exponential.</description>

      <title>Set Values for Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01661v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study mean field games with possibly multiple mean field equilibria. Instead of focusing on the individual equilibria, we propose to study the set of values over all possible equilibria, which we call the set value of the mean field game. When the mean field equilibrium is unique, typically under certain monotonicity conditions, our set value reduces to the singleton of the standard value function which solves the master equation. The set value is by nature unique, and we shall establish two crucial properties: (i) the dynamic programming principle, also called time consistency; and (ii) the convergence of the set values of the corresponding $N$-player games, which can be viewed as a type of stability result. To our best knowledge, this is the first work in the literature which studies the dynamic value of mean field games without requiring the uniqueness of mean field equilibria. We emphasize that the set value is very sensitive to the type of the admissible controls. In particular, for the convergence one has to restrict to corresponding types of equilibria for the N-player game and for the mean field game. We shall illustrate this point by investigating three cases, two in finite state space models and the other in a continuous time model with controlled diffusions.</description>

      <title>Causality for Complex Continuous-time Functional Longitudinal Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paramount obstacle in longitudinal studies for causal inference is the complex "treatment-confounder feedback." Traditional methodologies for elucidating causal effects in longitudinal analyses are primarily based on the assumption that time moves in specific intervals or that changes in treatment occur discretely. This conventional view confines treatment-confounder feedback to a limited, countable scope. The advent of real-time monitoring in modern medical research introduces functional longitudinal data with dynamically time-varying outcomes, treatments, and confounders, necessitating dealing with a potentially uncountably infinite treatment-confounder feedback. Thus, there is an urgent need for a more elaborate and refined theoretical framework to navigate these intricacies. Recently, Ying (2024) proposed a preliminary framework focusing on end-of-study outcomes and addressing the causality in functional longitudinal data. Our paper expands significantly upon his foundation in fourfold: First, we conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature, which not only fosters a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts but also illuminates the genesis of both Ying (2024)'s and ours. Second, we extend Ying (2024) to fully embrace a functional time-varying outcome process, incorporating right censoring and truncation by death, which are both significant and practical concerns. Third, we formalize previously informal propositions in Ying (2024), demonstrating how this framework broadens the existing frameworks in a nonparametric manner. Lastly, we delve into a detailed discussion on the interpretability and feasibility of our assumptions, and outlining a strategy for future numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Trajectory inference for a branching SDE model of cell differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A core challenge for modern biology is how to infer the trajectories of individual cells from population-level time courses of high-dimensional gene expression data. Birth and death of cells present a particular difficulty: existing trajectory inference methods cannot distinguish variability in net proliferation from cell differentiation dynamics, and hence require accurate prior knowledge of the proliferation rate. Building on Global Waddington-OT (gWOT), which performs trajectory inference with rigorous theoretical guarantees when birth and death can be neglected, we show how to use lineage trees available with recently developed CRISPR-based measurement technologies to disentangle proliferation and differentiation. In particular, when there is neither death nor subsampling of cells, we show that we extend gWOT to the case with proliferation with similar theoretical guarantees and computational cost, without requiring any prior information. In the case of death and/or subsampling, our method introduces a bias, that we describe explicitly and argue to be inherent to these lineage tracing data. We demonstrate in both cases the ability of this method to reliably reconstruct the landscape of a branching SDE from time-courses of simulated datasets with lineage tracing, outperforming even a benchmark using the experimentally unavailable true branching rates.</description>

      <title>Properties of Discrete Sliced Wasserstein Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance has become a popular alternative to the Wasserstein distance for comparing probability measures. Widespread applications include image processing, domain adaptation and generative modelling, where it is common to optimise some parameters in order to minimise SW, which serves as a loss function between discrete probability measures (since measures admitting densities are numerically unattainable). All these optimisation problems bear the same sub-problem, which is minimising the Sliced Wasserstein energy. In this paper we study the properties of $\mathcal{E}: Y \longmapsto \mathrm{SW}_2^2(\gamma_Y, \gamma_Z)$, i.e. the SW distance between two uniform discrete measures with the same amount of points as a function of the support $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ of one of the measures. We investigate the regularity and optimisation properties of this energy, as well as its Monte-Carlo approximation $\mathcal{E}_p$ (estimating the expectation in SW using only $p$ samples) and show convergence results on the critical points of $\mathcal{E}_p$ to those of $\mathcal{E}$, as well as an almost-sure uniform convergence. Finally, we show that in a certain sense, Stochastic Gradient Descent methods minimising $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{E}_p$ converge towards (Clarke) critical points of these energies.</description>

      <title>Convergence of SGD for Training Neural Networks with Sliced Wasserstein Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal Transport has sparked vivid interest in recent years, in particular thanks to the Wasserstein distance, which provides a geometrically sensible and intuitive way of comparing probability measures. For computational reasons, the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance was introduced as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance, and has seen uses for training generative Neural Networks (NNs). While convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been observed practically in such a setting, there is to our knowledge no theoretical guarantee for this observation. Leveraging recent works on convergence of SGD on non-smooth and non-convex functions by Bianchi et al. (2022), we aim to bridge that knowledge gap, and provide a realistic context under which fixed-step SGD trajectories for the SW loss on NN parameters converge. More precisely, we show that the trajectories approach the set of (sub)-gradient flow equations as the step decreases. Under stricter assumptions, we show a much stronger convergence result for noised and projected SGD schemes, namely that the long-run limits of the trajectories approach a set of generalised critical points of the loss function.</description>

      <title>The Poisson boundary of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complete description of the Poisson boundary of wreath products $A\wr B= \bigoplus_{B} A\rtimes B$ of countable groups $A$ and $B$, for probability measures $\mu$ with finite entropy where lamp configurations stabilize almost surely. If, in addition, the projection of $\mu$ to $B$ is Liouville, we prove that the Poisson boundary of $(A\wr B,\mu)$ is equal to the space of limit lamp configurations, endowed with the corresponding hitting measure. In particular, this answers an open question asked by Kaimanovich, and Lyons-Peres, for $B=\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\ge 3$, and measures $\mu$ with a finite first moment.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Proof for the Expected Number of Distinct Consecutive Patterns in a Random Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\pi_n$ be a uniformly chosen random permutation on $[n]$. Using an analysis of the probability that two overlapping consecutive $k$-permutations are order isomorphic, the authors of a recent paper showed that the expected number of distinct consecutive patterns of all lengths $k\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ in $\pi_n$ is $\frac{n^2}{2}(1-o(1))$ as $n\to\infty$. This exhibited the fact that random permutations pack consecutive patterns near-perfectly. We use entirely different methods, namely the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation, to reprove and slightly improve their result.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of L\'evy's Theorem on Positive Matrix Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize a fundamental theorem on positive matrix semigroups stating that each component is either strictly positive for all times or identically zero ("L\'evy's Theorem"). Our proof of this fact that does not require the matrices to be Markovian nor to be continuous at time zero. We also provide a formulation of this theorem in the terminology of one-parameter operator semigroups on sequence spaces.</description>

      <title>Product Mixing in Compact Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15456v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $G$ is a group, we say a subset $S$ of $G$ is product-free if the equation $xy=z$ has no solutions with $x,y,z \in S$. For $D \in \mathbb{N}$, a group $G$ is said to be $D$-quasirandom if the minimal dimension of a nontrivial complex irreducible representation of $G$ is at least $D$. Gowers showed that in a $D$-quasirandom finite group $G$, the maximal size of a product-free set is at most $|G|/D^{1/3}$. This disproved a longstanding conjecture of Babai and S\'os from 1985.
  For the special unitary group, $G=SU(n)$, Gowers observed that his argument yields an upper bound of $n^{-1/3}$ on the measure of a measurable product-free subset. In this paper, we improve Gowers' upper bound to $\exp(-cn^{1/3})$, where $c&gt;0$ is an absolute constant. In fact, we establish something stronger, namely, product-mixing for measurable subsets of $SU(n)$ with measure at least $\exp(-cn^{1/3})$; for this product-mixing result, the $n^{1/3}$ in the exponent is sharp.
  Our approach involves introducing novel hypercontractive inequalities, which imply that the non-Abelian Fourier spectrum of the indicator function of a small set concentrates on high-dimensional irreducible representations.
  Our hypercontractive inequalities are obtained via methods from representation theory, harmonic analysis, random matrix theory and differential geometry. We generalize our hypercontractive inequalities from $SU(n)$ to an arbitrary $D$-quasirandom compact connected Lie group for $D$ at least an absolute constant, thereby extending our results on product-free sets to such groups.
  We also demonstrate various other applications of our inequalities to geometry (viz., non-Abelian Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities), mixing times, and the theory of growth in compact Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Balls in groups: volume, structure and growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give sharp bounds in Breuillard, Green and Tao's finitary version of Gromov's theorem on groups with polynomial growth. Precisely, we show that for every non-negative integer d there exists $c=c(d)&gt;0$ such that if $G$ is a group with finite symmetric generating set $S$ containing the identity and $|S^n|\le cn^{d+1}|S|$ for some positive integer $n$ then there exist normal subgroups $H\le\Gamma\le G$ such that $H\subseteq S^n$, such that $\Gamma/H$ is $d$-nilpotent (i.e. has a central series of length $d$ with cyclic factors), and such that $[G:\Gamma]\le g(d)$, where $g(d)$ denotes the maximum order of a finite subgroup of $GL_d(\mathbb{Z})$. The bounds on both the nilpotence and index are sharp; the previous best bounds were $O(d)$ on the nilpotence, and an ineffective function of $d$ on the index. In fact, we obtain this as a small part of a much more detailed fine-scale description of the structure of $G$. These results have a wide range of applications in various aspects of the theory of vertex-transitive graphs: percolation theory, random walks, structure of finite groups, scaling limits of finite vertex-transitive graphs.... We obtain some of these applications in the present paper, and treat others in companion papers. Some are due to or joint with other authors.</description>
