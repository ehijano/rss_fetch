      <title>Free summands of stably free modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring. One may ask when a general $R$-module $P$ that satisfies $P \oplus R \cong R^n$ has a free summand of a given rank. M. Raynaud translated this question into one about sections of certain maps between Stiefel varieties: if $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n)$ denotes the Stiefel variety $\textrm{GL}(n) / \textrm{GL}(n-r)$ over a field $k$, then the projection $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n) \to V_1(\mathbb{A}^n)$ has a section if and only if the following holds: any module $P$ over any $k$-algebra $R$ with the property that $P \oplus R \cong R^n$ has a free summand of rank $r-1$. Using techniques from $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory, we characterize those $n$ for which the map $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n) \to V_1(\mathbb{A}^n)$ has a section in the cases $r=3,4$ under some assumptions on the base field. We conclude that if $P \oplus R \cong R^{24m}$ and $R$ contains a field of characteristic $0$, then $P$ contains a free summand of rank $2$. If $R$ contains a quadratically closed field of characteristic $0$, or the field of real numbers, then $P$ contains a free summand of rank $3$. The analogous results hold for schemes and vector bundles over them.</description>

      <title>Some Foundational Results In Adic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we record some foundational results on adic geometry that seem to be missing in the existing literature. Namely, we develop the Proj construction and a theory of lci closed immersions in the context of locally noetherian analytic adic spaces. In the context of rigid-analytic spaces, these topics have previously been considered in [GL21] and [Con07]. We also develop an etale six functor formalism in the analytic geometry and give a categorical description of lisse and constructible sheaves. All results of this paper are probably well-known to the experts.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-Rings of Partial Flag Varieties, Coulomb Branches, and the Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove an explicit presentation for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving a conjecture of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou. We also give an identification of the ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model, which proves that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic. This isomorphism also provides a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles that appear in the latter ring.</description>

Abstract: We develop a theory of Prym varieties and cubic threefolds over fields of characteristic $2$. As an application, we prove that smooth cubic threefolds are non-rational over an arbitrary field and solve a conjecture of Deligne regarding arithmetic Torelli maps.

      <title>Relative Dolbeault Geometric Langlands via the Regular Quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X = G/H$ be an affine homogeneous spherical variety with abelian regular centralizer and no type N roots. In this paper, we formulate a relative geometric Langlands conjecture in the Dolbeault setting for $M = T^*X$. More concretely, we conjecture a Fourier-Mukai duality between the Dolbeault period sheaf and a sheaf whose construction closely resembles the Dirac-Higgs bundle of a polarization of the dual symplectic representation of Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh. These conjectures can be seen as a generalization of Hitchin's conjectural duality of branes for symmetric spaces. We verify these conjectures in several cases, including the Friedberg-Jacquet case $X = GL_{2n}/GL_n\times GL_n$, the Jacquet-Ichino case $X = PGL_2^3/PGL_2$, the Rankin-Selberg case $X = GL_n\times GL_{n+1}/GL_n$, and the Gross-Prasad case $X = SO_n\times SO_{n+1}/SO_n$. Our main tool is the theory of the regular quotient, which was described in the context of symmetric spaces in [HM24].</description>

      <title>Generalized optimal degenerations of Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the algebraic version of Tian conjecture. Precisely, for any smooth strictly increasing function $g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ with ${\rm log}\circ g$ convex, we define the $\mathbf{H}^g$-invariant on a Fano variety $X$ generalizing the $\mathbf{H}$-invariant introduced by Tian-Zhang-Zhang-Zhu, and show that $\mathbf{H}^g$ admits a unique minimizer. Such a minimizer will induce the $g$-optimal degeneration of the Fano variety $X$, whose limit space admits a $g'$-soliton. We present an example of Fano threefold which has the same $g$-optimal degenerations for any $g$.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory for local systems on the $3$-torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the Cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory of $G$-local systems on the topological three torus. Using an exponential map we prove cohomological integrality for $\mathrm{GL}_n$-local systems using the statement of cohomological integrality for the tripled Jordan quiver from Davison-Meinhardt (2020). Using this result we prove a version of cohomological integrality for $\mathrm{SL}_n$ and $\mathrm{PGL}_n$ for prime $n$. Finally, for prime $n$, we prove a Langlands duality statement for the $\mathrm{SL}_n$ and $\mathrm{PGL}_n$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use algebraic geometry to study the anomaly-free representations of an arbitrary gauge Lie algebra for 4-dimensional spacetime fermions. For irreducible representations, the problem reduces to studying the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{su}_n$ for $n\geq 3$. We show that there exist equivalence classes of such representations that are in bijection with the rational points on a projective variety that are dense in a region of the underlying real variety diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n-3}$. It follows that the chiral ones overwhelm the non-chiral ones for $n \geq 5$. We present an efficient algorithm to find explicit anomaly-free irreducible representations and discuss the generalization to reducible representations.</description>

      <title>Positive Geometries for Scattering Amplitudes in N=4 SYM and ABJM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis investigates geometric descriptions of scattering amplitudes, with a specific focus on scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM and ABJM theory. The recent development of the field of positive geometries provides us with a suitable framework for this endeavour. In particular, we will give a detailed account of the amplituhedron, the momentum amplituhedron, and the ABJM momentum amplituhedron. Alongside these geometries, we will also discuss the ABHY associahedron, which encapsulates tree-level scattering amplitudes in bi-adjoint scalar theory. We provide a detailed introduction to these positive geometries, which includes a comprehensive discussion of their structure. For the momentum amplituhedron, ABJM momentum amplituhedron, and ABHY associahedron we give a full stratification of their boundaries, which equivalently elucidates the singularity structure of the tree-level scattering amplitudes. Notably, we show that the ABJM momentum amplituhedron has an Euler characteristic equal to one. Furthermore, we explore the interconnections between these, and other, positive geometries. These connections are in part obtained via push forwards through the scattering equations. We develop techniques to calculate these push forwards which circumvents the necessity to solve the scattering equations explicitly. Beyond tree-level, we illustrate how positive geometries can be used to describe loop integrands in planar N=4 SYM and ABJM. A new framework is established to investigate these loop geometries in the space of dual momenta. The construction relies solely on lightcones and their intersections, and the framework simultaneously encompasses the loop level structure of the amplituhedron, momentum amplituhedron, and the ABJM momentum amplituhedron. This further leads to compact general formulae for all one-loop integrands in N=4 SYM and ABJM.</description>

      <title>Empirically Exploring the Space of Monostationarity in Dual Phosphorylation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dual phosphorylation network provides an essential component of intracellular signaling, affecting the expression of phenotypes and cell metabolism. For particular choices of kinetic parameters, this system exhibits multistationarity, a property that is relevant in the decision-making of cells. Determining which reaction rate constants correspond to monostationarity and which produce multistationarity is an open problem. The system's monostationarity is linked to the nonnegativity of a specific polynomial. A previous study by Feliu et al. provides a sufficient condition for monostationarity via a decomposition of this polynomial into nonnegative circuit polynomials. However, this decomposition is not unique. We extend their work by a systematic approach to classifying such decompositions in the dual phosphorylation network. Using this result classification, we provide a qualitative comparison of the decompositions into nonnegative circuit polynomials via empirical experiments and improve on previous conditions for the region of monostationarity.</description>

      <title>Perverse sheaves and t-structures on the thin and thick affine flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the categories $\mathrm{Perv}_{\mathrm{thin}}$ and $\mathrm{Perv}_{\mathrm{thick}}$ of Iwahori-equivariant perverse sheaves on the thin and thick affine flag varieties associated to a split reductive group $G$. An earlier work of the first author describes $\mathrm{Perv}_{\mathrm{thin}}$ in terms of bimodules over the so-called non-commutative Springer resolution. We partly extend this result to $\mathrm{Perv}_{\mathrm{thick}}$, providing a similar description for its anti-spherical quotient. The long intertwining functor realizes $\mathrm{Perv}_{\mathrm{thick}}$ as the Ringel dual of $\mathrm{Perv}_{\mathrm{thin}}$, we point out that it shares some exactness properties with the similar functor acting on perverse sheaves on the finite-dimensional flag variety. We use this result to resolve a conjecture of Arkhipov and the first author, proving that the image in the Iwahori-Whittaker category of any convolution-exact perverse sheaf on the affine flag variety is tilting.</description>

Abstract: Consider a pair consisting of an abstract tropical curve and an effective divisor from the linear system associated to $k$ times the canonical divisor for $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$. In this article we give a purely combinatorial criterion to determine if such a pair arises as the tropicalization of a pair consisting of a smooth algebraic curve over a non-Archimedean field with algebraically closed residue field of characteristic 0 together with an effective pluri-canonical divisor. To do so, we introduce tropical normalized covers as special instances of tropical Hurwitz covers and reduce the realizability problem for pluri-canonical divisors to the realizability problem for normalized covers. Our main result generalizes the work of M\"oller-Ulirsch-Werner on realizability of tropical canonical divisors and incorporates the recent progress on compactifications of strata of $k$-differentials in the work of Bainbridge-Chen-Gendron-Grushevsky-M\"oller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any geometrically connected curve $X$ over a field $k$ is an algebraic $K(\pi,1)$, as soon as its geometric irreducible components have nonzero genus. This means that the cohomology of any locally constant constructible \'etale sheaf of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$-modules, with $n$ invertible in $k$, is canonically isomorphic to the cohomology of its corresponding $\pi_1(X)$-module. To this end, we explicitly construct some Galois coverings of $X$ corresponding to Galois coverings of the normalisation of its irreducible components. When $k$ is finite or separably closed, we explicitly describe finite quotients of $\pi_1(X)$ that allow to compute the cohomology groups of the sheaf, and give explicit descriptions of the cup products $H^1\times H^1\to H^2$ and $H^1\times H^2\to H^3$ in terms of finite group cohomology.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to study the Betti homology and de Rham cohomology of twisted symmetric powers of the Kloosterman connection of rank two on the torus. We compute the period pairing and, with respect to certain bases, interpret these associated period numbers in terms of the Bessel moments. Via the rational structures on Betti homology and de Rham cohomology, we prove the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear and quadratic relations among these Bessel moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized strata of meromorphic differentials are loci in the usual strata of differentials, where certain sets of residues sum up to zero. They appear naturally in the boundary of the multi-scale compactification of the usual strata. Enumerating the connected components of generalized strata is necessary to understand the boundary complex of the multi-scale compactification. In this paper we classify connected components of the strata of residueless meromorphic differentials, which are the strata with the maximum possible number of conditions imposed on the residues of the poles.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a functorial method to define ramification groups, identifying them as inertia groups of an induced action on composite jet algebras. This framework lays the foundation for defining higher ramification groups for actions involving group schemes. To achieve this, we introduce Taylor maps within the category of commutative unitary rings at prime ideals of an R-algebra and compute their kernels for algebras of finite type over a field with separably generated residue fields.</description>

      <title>A global approach for the redefinition of higher-order flexibility and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous example of the double-Watt mechanism given by Connelly and Servatius raises some problems concerning the classical definitions of higher-order flexibility and rigidity, respectively, as they attest the cusp configuration of the mechanism a third-order rigidity, which conflicts with its continuous flexion. Some attempts were done to resolve the dilemma but they could not settle the problem. As cusp mechanisms demonstrate the basic shortcoming of any local mobility analysis using higher-order constraints, we present a global approach inspired by Sabitov's finite algorithm for testing the bendability of a polyhedron, which allows us (a) to compute iteratively configurations with a higher-order flexion and (b) to come up with a proper redefinition of higher-order flexibility and rigidity. The presented approach is demonstrated on several examples (double-Watt mechanisms and Tarnai's Leonardo structure). Moreover, we determine all configurations of a given 3-RPR manipulator with a third-order flexion and present a corresponding joint-bar framework of flexion order 23.</description>

      <title>Locally Trivial Deformations of Toric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study locally trivial deformations of toric varieties from a combinatorial point of view. For any fan $\Sigma$, we construct a deformation functor $\mathrm{Def}_\Sigma$ by considering \v{C}ech zero-cochains on certain simplicial complexes. We show that under appropriate hypotheses, $\mathrm{Def}_\Sigma$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Def}'_{X_\Sigma}$, the functor of locally trivial deformations for the toric variety $X_\Sigma$ associated to $\Sigma$. In particular, for any complete toric variety $X$ that is smooth in codimension $2$ and $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial in codimension $3$, there exists a fan $\Sigma$ such that $\mathrm{Def}_\Sigma$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Def}_X$, the functor of deformations of $X$. We apply these results to give a new criterion for a smooth complete toric variety to have unobstructed deformations, and to compute formulas for higher order obstructions, generalizing a formula of Ilten and Turo for the cup product. We use the functor $\mathrm{Def}_\Sigma$ to explicitly compute the deformation spaces for a number of toric varieties, and provide examples exhibiting previously unobserved phenomena. In particular, we classify exactly which toric threefolds arising as iterated $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles have unobstructed deformation space.</description>

      <title>Reductive group actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1604.01005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study rationality properties of reductive group actions which are defined over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. Thereby, we unify Luna's theory of spherical systems and Borel-Tits' theory of reductive groups. In particular, we define for any reductive group action a generalized Tits index whose main constituents are a root system and a generalization of the anisotropic kernel. The index controls to a large extent the behavior at infinity (i.e., embeddings). For k-spherical varieties (i.e., where a minimal parabolic has an open orbit) we obtain explicit (wonderful) completions of the set of rational points. For local fields this means honest compactifications generalizing the maximal Satake compactification of a symmetric space. Our main tool is a k-version of the local structure theorem.</description>

      <title>Cosmology meets cohomology</title>

Abstract: The cosmological polytope and bootstrap programs have revealed interesting connections between positive geometries, modern on-shell methods and bootstrap principles studied in the amplitudes community with the wavefunction of the Universe in toy models of FRW cosmologies. To compute these FRW correlators, one often faces integrals that are too difficult to evaluate by direct integration. Borrowing from the Feynman integral community, the method of (canonical) differential equations provides an efficient alternative for evaluating these integrals. Moreover, we further develop our geometric understanding of these integrals by describing the associated \emph{relative} twisted cohomology. Leveraging recent progress in our understanding of relative twisted cohomology in the Feynman integral community, we give an algorithm to predict the basis size and simplify the computation of the differential equations satisfied by FRW correlators.</description>

      <title>Hikita conjecture for classical Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be $Sp_{2n}$, $SO_{2n}$ or $SO_{2n+1}$ and let $G^\vee$ be its Langlands dual group. Barbash and Vogan based on earlier work of Lusztig and Spaltenstein, define a duality map $D$ that sends nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee} \subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$ to special nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_e\subset \mathfrak{g}$. In a work by Losev, Mason-Brown and Matvieievskyi, an upgraded version $\tilde{D}$ of this duality is considered, called the refined BVLS duality. $\tilde{D}(\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee})$ is a $G$-equivariant cover $\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e$ of $\mathbb{O}_e$. Let $S_{{e^\vee}}$ be the nilpotent Slodowy slice of the orbit $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee}$. The two varieties $X^\vee= S_{e^\vee}$ and $X=$ Spec$(\mathbb{C}[\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e])$ are expected to be symplectic dual to each other. In this context, a version of the Hikita conjecture predicts an isomorphism between the cohomology ring of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_{e^\vee}$ and the ring of regular functions on the scheme-theoretic fixed point $X^T$ for some torus $T$. This paper verifies the isomorphism for certain pairs $e$ and $e^\vee$. These cases are expected to cover almost all instances in which the Hikita conjecture holds when $e^\vee$ regular in a Levi $\mathfrak{l}^\vee\subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$. Our results in these cases follow from the relations of three different types of objects: generalized coinvariant algebras, equivariant cohomology rings, and functions on scheme-theoretic intersections. We also give evidence for the Hikita conjecture when $e^\vee$ is distinguished.</description>
