      <title>Unifying Weak Independence and Signal Hierarchy Theory: Extended Biological Petri Net Formalism with Application to Vibrio fischeri Quorum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological Petri Nets (Bio-PNs) require extensions beyond classical formalism to capture biochemical reality: multiple reactions simultaneously affect shared metabolites through convergent production or regulatory coupling, while signal places carry hierarchical control information distinct from material flow. We present a unified 13-tuple Extended Bio-PN formalism integrating two complementary theories: Weak Independence Theory (enabling coupled parallelism despite place-sharing) and Signal Hierarchy Theory (separating information flow from mass transfer). The extended definition adds signal partition (Psi subset P), arc type classification (A), regulatory structure (Sigma), environmental exchange (Theta), dependency taxonomy (Delta), heterogeneous transition types (tau), and biochemical formula tracking (rho). We formalize signal token consumption semantics through two-phase execution (enabling vs. consumption) and prove weak independence correctness for continuous dynamics. Application to Vibrio fischeri quorum sensing demonstrates how energy metabolism (ENERGY signals) orchestrates binary ON/OFF decisions through hierarchical constraint propagation to regulatory signals (LuxR-AHL complex), with 133-fold difference separating states. Analysis reveals signal saturation timing as the orchestrator forcing threshold-crossing, analogous to bacteriophage lambda lysogeny-lysis decisions. This work establishes formal foundations for modeling biological information flow in Petri nets, with implications for systems biology, synthetic circuit design, and parallel biochemical simulation.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object's environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT's concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.</description>
