      <title>Interpolative separable density fitting on adaptive real space grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) method, used for compressing the four-index electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor, to incorporate adaptive real space grids for potentially highly localized single-particle basis functions. To do so, we employ a fast adaptive algorithm, the recently-introduced dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting method, to solve the Poisson equation for the ISDF auxiliary basis functions. The adaptive grids are generated using a high-order accurate, black-box procedure that satisfies a user-specified error tolerance. Our algorithm relies on the observation, which we prove, that an adaptive grid resolving the pair densities appearing in the ERI tensor can be straightforwardly constructed from one that resolves the single-particle basis functions, with the number of required grid points differing only by a constant factor. We find that the ISDF compression efficiency for the ERI tensor with highly localized basis sets is comparable to that for smoother basis sets compatible with uniform grids. To demonstrate the performance of our procedure, we consider several molecular systems with all-electron basis sets which are intractable using uniform grid-based methods. Our work establishes a pathway for scalable many-body electronic structure simulations with arbitrary smooth basis functions, making simulations of phenomena like core-level excitations feasible on a large scale.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field/Discontinuity Capturing operator for direct van der Waals simulation (DVS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuity capturing (DC) operators are commonly employed to numerically solve problems involving sharp gradients in the solution. Despite their success, the application of DC operators to the direct van der Waals simulation (DVS) remains challenging. The DVS framework models non-equilibrium phase transitions by admitting interfacial regions in which the derivative of pressure with respect to density is negative. In these regions, we demonstrate that classical DC operators may violate the free energy dissipation law and produce unphysical wave structures. To address this limitation, we propose the phase-field/discontinuity capturing (PF/DC) operator. Numerical results show that PF/DC yields stable and accurate solutions in both bulk fluids and interfacial regions. Finally, we apply the proposed method to simulate cavitating flow over a three-dimensional bluff body, obtaining excellent agreement with experimental data and significant improvements over results produced using classical DC operators.</description>

      <title>Fast adaptive discontinuous basis sets for electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework for automatically constructing adaptive basis sets for electronic structure calculations. By allowing basis functions to be discontinuous across element interfaces, our approach supports flexible combinations of atom-centered and polynomial basis sets, maintains favorable numerical conditioning, and induces structured sparsity of the one- and two-electron integrals, which we compute using specialised numerical integration strategies. We also introduce multigrid-preconditioned Poisson solvers that enable fast algorithms for both Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations within our DG basis sets. Moreover, these basis sets naturally support adaptive multigrid preconditioning for the linear eigensolvers employed within the self-consistent field iteration for HF and DFT. Numerical experiments for HF and DFT demonstrate that our approach achieves chemical accuracy with modest basis sizes that compare favorably to the sizes of ordinary GTO basis sets achieving similar accuracy, while offering additional structured sparsity and improved computational scalability in the size-extensive limit. The framework thus provides a flexible route toward the construction of systematically improvable and structured adaptive basis sets for electronic structure theory.</description>

Abstract: This work demonstrates algorithms to accurately compute solutions to thermal radiation transport problems using a reduced floating-point precision implementation of the Implicit Monte Carlo method. Several techniques falling into the categories of arithmetic manipulations and scaling methods are evaluated for their ability to improve the accuracy of reduced-precision computations.

      <title>Physically consistent and uncertainty-aware learning of spatiotemporal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate, physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.</description>

      <title>On the flow matching interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates, however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable physical processes.</description>

      <title>Linked Cell Traversal Algorithms for Three-Body Interactions in Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, algorithms for the parallel computation of three-body interactions in molecular dynamics are developed. While traversals for the computation of pair interactions are readily available in the literature, here, such traversals are extended to allow for the computation between molecules stored across three cells. A general framework for the computation of three-body interactions in linked cells is described, and then used to implement the corresponding traversals. In addition, our analysis is combined with the commonly used cutoff conditions, because they influence the total workload of the computation of interactions. The combinations between traversals and truncation conditions are validated using the well-known Lennard-Jones fluid. Validation case studies are taken from the literature and configured into homogeneous and inhomogeneous scenarios. Finally, strong scalability and performance in terms of molecule updates are measured at node-level.</description>

      <title>Optimal spin-charge interconversion in graphene through spin-pseudospin entanglement control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical generation of spin signals is of central interest for spintronics, where graphene stands as a relevant platform as its spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is tuned by proximity effects. Here, we propose an enhancement of spin-charge interconversion in graphene by controlling the intraparticle entanglement between the spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that, although the spin alone is not conserved in Rashba-Dirac systems, a combined spin-pseudospin operator is conserved. This conserved quantity represents the interconversion between pure spin and pseudospin textures to a spin-pseudospin entangled structure, where Kane-Mele SOC tunes this balance. By these means, we achieve spin-charge interconversion of 100\% efficiency via the Rashba-Edelstein effect. Quantum transport simulations in disordered micron-size systems demonstrate the robustness of this effect, and also reveal a disorder resilient spin Hall effect generated by the interplay between Rashba and Kane-Mele SOC. Our findings propose a platform for maximally efficient spin-charge interconversion, and establish spin-pseudospin correlations as a mechanism to tailor spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>A complex Gaussian representation of continuum wavefunctions respectful of their asymptotic behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex Gaussian basis sets are optimized to accurately represent continuum radial wavefunctions over the whole space. First, attention is put on the technical ability of the optimization method to get more flexible series of Gaussian exponents, in order to improve the accuracy of the fitting approach. Second, an indirect fitting method is proposed, allowing for the oscillatory behaviour of continuum functions to be conserved up to infinity as a factorized asymptotic function, while the Gaussian representation is applied to some appropriately defined distortion factor with limited spatial extension. As an illustration, the method is applied to radial Coulomb functions with realistic energy parameters. We also show that the indirect fitting approach keeps the advantageous analytical structure of typical one-electron transition integrals occurring in molecular ionization applications.</description>

      <title>On Robust $\beta$-Spectra Shape Parameter Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental extraction of $\beta$-shape functions, C(W), is challenging. Comparing different experimental $\beta$-shapes to each other and to those predicted by theory in a consistent manner is difficult. This difficulty is compounded when different parameterizations of the $\beta$-shape function are used. Usually some form of a power polynomial of the total electron energy is chosen for this parametrization. This choice results in extracted coefficients that are highly correlated, with their physical meaning and numerical value dependent on the order of polynomial chosen. This is true for both theoretical and experimental coefficients, and leads to challenges when comparing coefficients from polynomials of different orders. Accurately representing the highly correlated uncertainties is difficult and subtle. These issues impact the underlying physical interpretation of shape function parameters. We suggest an alternative approach based on orthogonal polynomials. Orthogonal polynomials offer more stable coefficient extraction which is less dependent on the order of the polynomial, allow for easier comparison between theory and experimental coefficients from polynomials of different orders, and offer some observations on simple physical meaning and on the statistical limits of the extracted coefficients.</description>

      <title>TMMax: High-performance modeling of multilayer thin-film structures using transfer matrix method with JAX</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical multilayer thin-films are fundamental components that enable the precise control of reflectance, transmittance, and phase shift in the design of photonic systems. Rapid and accessible simulation of these structures holds critical importance for designing and analyzing complex coatings. While researchers commonly use the traditional transfer matrix method for designing these structures, its scalar approach to wavelength and angle of incidence causes redundant recalculations and inefficiencies in large-scale simulations. Furthermore, traditional method implementations do not support automatic differentiation, which limits their applicability in gradient-based inverse design approaches. Here, we present TMMax, a Python library that fully vectorizes and accelerates transfer matrix method using the high-performance machine learning library JAX. TMMax supports CPU, GPU, and TPU hardware, and includes a publicly available material database. Our approach, demonstrated through benchmarking, allows us to model thin-film stacks with hundreds of layers within seconds. This illustrates that our method achieves a simulation speedup of x100s over a baseline NumPy implementation, enabling optical engineers and thin-film researchers in optics and photonics to efficiently design complex dielectric multilayer structures through rapid and scalable simulations.</description>

Abstract: Rapid progress in the experimental control and interrogation of molecules, combined with developments in precise calculations of their structure, are enabling new opportunities in the investigation of nuclear and particle physics phenomena. Molecules containing heavy, octupole-deformed nuclei such as radium are of particular interest for such studies, offering an enhanced sensitivity to the properties of fundamental particles and interactions. Here, we report precision laser spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations of the structure of the radioactive radium monofluoride molecule, $^{225}$Ra$^{19}$F. Our results allow fine details of the short-range electron-nucleus interaction to be revealed, indicating the high sensitivity of this molecule to the distribution of magnetization, currently a poorly constrained nuclear property, within the radium nucleus. These results provide a direct and stringent test of the description of the electronic wavefunction inside the nuclear volume, highlighting the suitability of these molecules to investigate subatomic phenomena.</description>

      <title>A linearly-implicit energy-momentum preserving scheme for geometrically nonlinear mechanics based on non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04695v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel formulation and numerical strategy for the simulation of geometrically nonlinear structures. First, a non-canonical Hamiltonian (Poisson) formulation is introduced by including the dynamics of the stress tensor. This framework is developed for von-K\'arm\'an nonlinearities in beams and plates, as well as geometrically nonlinear elasticity with Saint-Venant material behavior. In the case of plates, both negligible and non-negligible membrane inertia are considered. For the former case the two-dimensional elasticity complex is leveraged to express the dynamics in terms of the Airy stress function. The finite element discretization employs a mixed approach, combining a conforming approximation for displacement and velocity fields with a discontinuous stress tensor representation. A staggered, linear implicit time integration scheme is proposed, establishing connections with existing explicit-implicit energy-preserving methods. The stress degrees of freedom are statically condensed, reducing the computational complexity to solving a system with a positive definite matrix. The integration strategy preserves energy and angular momentum exactly. The methodology is validated through numerical experiments on the Duffing oscillator, a von-K\'arm\'an beam, and a column undergoing finite deformations. Comparisons with fully implicit energy-preserving method and the leapfrog scheme demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy while maintaining energy stability. Additionally, it enables larger time steps compared to explicit schemes and exhibits computational efficiency comparable to the leapfrog method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport (FEAT), a novel framework for free energy estimation -- a critical challenge across scientific domains. FEAT leverages learned transports implemented via stochastic interpolants and provides consistent, minimum-variance estimators based on escorted Jarzynski equality and controlled Crooks theorem, alongside variational upper and lower bounds on free energy differences. Unifying equilibrium and non-equilibrium methods under a single theoretical framework, FEAT establishes a principled foundation for neural free energy calculations. Experimental validation on toy examples, molecular simulations, and quantum field theory demonstrates improvements over existing learning-based methods.

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROM) are very popular for surrogate modeling of full-order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, allowing for real-time approximation of complex flow phenomena. However, their application to CFD models including large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulaton (DNS) is limited due to the highly chaotic and multi-scale nature of resolved turbulent flow. Due to the large amounts of noise present in small-scale turbulent structures, error propagation becomes a major issue, making long-term prediction of unsteady flow infeasible. While linear subspace methods like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) can be used to pre-process turbulent flow data to remove small-scale structures, this often requires a very large number of modes and a non-trivial mode selection process. In this work, a ROM framework using Koopman $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) is introduced for reduced-order modeling of large-scale turbulence. The Koopman operator captures the variation of a non-linear dynamical system through a linear representation of state observables. By constraining the latent space of a $\beta$-VAE to grow linearly using a Koopman-inspired loss function, small-scale turbulent structures are filtered out in reconstructions of input data and latent variables are denoised in an unsupervised manner so that they can be sufficiently modeled over time. Combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) ensemble for time series prediction of latent variables, the model is tested on LES flow past a Windsor body at multiple yaw angles, showing that the Koopman $\beta$-VAE can effectively denoise latent variables and remove small-scale structures from reconstructions while acting globally over multiple cases.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Nonrelativistic Charge-Spin Conversion in X-Type Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19194</link>

Abstract: Altermagnets have attracted considerable interest due to the symmetry-induced anisotropic spin splitting while preserving zero net magnetization, which enables efficient generation of spin currents. This work proposes a distinct class of antiferromagnetic materials, termed X-type antiferromagnets, which are shown to produce more efficient $\cal T$-odd spin currents than common altermagnets along specific crystallographic directions due to their unique Fermi surface geometry. The spin current polarization is controlled by the N\'eel vector orientation. As a prototype conducting X-type antiferromagnet, the Fermi surface of $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{PO}_5$ exhibits a distinct $d$-wave altermagnetic characteristic, which compresses into a nearly X-shaped configuration. This results in highly efficient $\cal T$-odd spin currents, achieving a charge-spin conversion efficiency of up to 90%. Moreover, when the N\'eel vector tilts to the out-of-plane direction, an in-plane injected charge current can generate a special spin current component with both spin polarization and propagation along the out-of-plane direction, whose charge-spin conversion efficiency substantially exceeds that of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices.</description>
