      <title>Finite groups with many normalizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ is said to have dense normalizers if each non-empty open interval in its subgroup lattice $L(G)$ contains the normalizer of a certain subgroup of $G$. In this note, we find all finite groups satisfying this property. We also classify the finite groups in which $k$ subgroups are not normalizers, for $k=1,2,3,4$.</description>

      <title>The m-partite digraphical representations of valency 3 of finite simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $m \geq 2$ an integer. An $m$-partite digraphical representation ($m$-PDR) of a group $G$ is a digraph $\Gamma = (V, E)$ satisfying the following properties: $\Gamma$ is regular; The automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ is isomorphic to $G$; $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ acts semiregularly on the vertex set $V$; The action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ partitions $V$ into exactly $m$ orbits, with each induced subgraph on an orbit being edgeless.
  In 2021, Du et al. \cite{du4} completed the classification of finite groups with respect to $m$-PDRs. In this paper, we provide a classification of m-PDR of valency 3 when \( G \) is a non-trivial finite simple group.</description>

      <title>Quasi-redirecting boundaries of non-positively curved groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-redirecting (QR) boundary is a close generalization of the Gromov boundary to all finitely generated groups. In this paper, we establish that the QR boundary exists as a topological space for several well-studied classes of groups. These include fundamental groups of irreducible non-geometric 3-manifolds, groups that are hyperbolic relative to subgroups with well-defined QR boundaries, right-angled Artin groups whose defining graphs are trees, and right-angled Coxeter groups whose defining flag complexes are planar. This result significantly broadens the known existence of QR boundaries. Additionally, we give a complete characterization of the QR boundaries of Croke-Kleiner admissible groups that act geometrically on CAT(0) spaces. We show that these boundaries are non-Hausdorff and can be understood as one-point compactifications of the Morse-like directions. Finally, we prove that if G is hyperbolic relative to subgroups with well-defined QR boundaries, then the QR boundary of G maps surjectively onto its Bowditch boundary.</description>

      <title>Groups of arbitrary lawlessness growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finitely generated lawless group $\Gamma$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $\mathcal{A}_{\Gamma} (n)$ be the minimal positive integer $M_n$ such that for all nontrivial reduced words $w$ of length at most $n$ in the free group of fixed rank $k \geq 2$, there exists $\overline{g} \in \Gamma^k$ of word-length at most $M_n$ with $w(\overline{g}) \neq e$. For any unbounded nondecreasing function $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ satisfying some mild assumptions, we construct $\Gamma$ such that the function $\mathcal{A}_{\Gamma}$ is equivalent to $f$. Our result generalizes both a Theorem of the first named author, who constructed groups for which $\mathcal{A}_{\Gamma}$ is unbounded but grows more slowly than any prescribed function $f$, and a result of Petschick, who constructed lawless groups for which $\mathcal{A}_{\Gamma}$ grows faster than any tower of exponential functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [3, Theorem 6.7B], the authors use the Main Theorems of Brauer to give a proof of Burnside's Normal $p$-complement Theorem. Unfortunately, the proof contains an error. We take this opportunity to give a proof along similar lines, circumventing the error by means of a well-known result on traces of totally positive cyclotomic integers.</description>

      <title>On the depth of subgroups of simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depth of a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$ is a positive integer defined with respect to the inclusion of the corresponding complex group algebras $\mathbb{C}H \subseteq \mathbb{C}G$. This notion was originally introduced by Boltje, Danz and K\"{u}lshammer in 2011, and it has been the subject of numerous papers in recent years. In this paper, we study the depth of core-free subgroups, which allows us to apply powerful computational and probabilistic techniques that were originally designed for studying bases for permutation groups. We use these methods to prove a wide range of new results on the depth of subgroups of almost simple groups, significantly extending the scope of earlier work in this direction. For example, we establish best possible bounds on the depth of irreducible subgroups of classical groups and primitive subgroups of symmetric groups. And with the exception of a handful of open cases involving the Baby Monster, we calculate the exact depth of every subgroup of every almost simple sporadic group. We also present a number of open problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>On Cameron's Greedy Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A base for a permutation group $G$ acting on a set $\Omega$ is a subset $\mathcal{B}$ of $\Omega$ whose pointwise stabiliser $G_{(\mathcal{B})}$ is trivial. There is a natural greedy algorithm for constructing a base of relatively small size. We write $\mathcal{G}(G)$ the maximum size of a base it produces, and $b(G)$ for the size of the smallest base for $G$. In 1999, Peter Cameron conjectured that there exists an absolute constant $c$ such that every finite primitive group $G$ satisfies $\mathcal{G}(G)\leq cb(G)$. We show that if $G$ is $\mathrm{S}_n$ or $\mathrm{A}_n$ acting primitively then either Cameron's Greedy Conjecture holds for $G$, or $G$ falls into one class of possible exceptions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of $\PSL(2,q)$ by the number of singular elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$, let $\pi(G)$ denote the set of all primes that divide the order of $G$. For a prime $r \in \pi(G)$, we define $r$-singular elements as those elements of $G$ whose order is divisible by $r$. Denote by $S_r(G)$ the number of $r$-singluar elements of $G$. We denote the proportion $S_r(G)/|G|$ of $r$-singular elements in $G$ by ${\mu_r}(G)$. Let $\mu(G) := {\{\mu_r}(G) | r\in \pi(G)\}$ be the set of all proportions of $r$-singular elements for each prime $r$ in $\pi(G)$. In this paper, we prove that if a finite group $G$ has the same set $\mu(G)$ as the simple group $\PSL(2,q)$, then $G$ is isomorphic to $\PSL(2,q)$.</description>

      <title>Finite groups with few character values that are not character degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ G $ be a finite group and $ \chi \in \mathrm{Irr}(G) $. Define $ \mathrm{cv}(G)=\{\chi(g)\mid \chi \in \mathrm{Irr}(G), g\in G \} $, $ \mathrm{cv}(\chi)=\{\chi(g)\mid g\in G \} $ and denote $ \mathrm{dl}(G) $ by the derived length of $ G $. In the 1990s Berkovich, Chillag and Zhmud described groups $ G $ in which $ |\mathrm{cv}(\chi)|=3 $ for every non-linear $ \chi \in \mathrm{Irr}(G) $ and their results show that $ G $ is solvable. They also considered groups in which $ |\mathrm{cv}(\chi)|=4 $ for some non-linear $ \chi \in \mathrm{Irr}(G) $. Continuing with their work, in this article, we prove that if $ |\mathrm{cv}(\chi)|\leqslant 4 $ for every non-linear $ \chi \in \mathrm{Irr}(G) $, then $ G $ is solvable. We also considered groups $ G $ such that $ |\mathrm{cv}(G)\setminus \mathrm{cd}(G)|=2 $. T. Sakurai classified these groups in the case when $ |\mathrm{cd}(G)|=2 $. We show that $ G $ is solvable and we classify groups $ G $ when $ |\mathrm{cd}(G)|\leqslant 4 $ or $ \mathrm{dl}(G)\leqslant 3 $. It is interesting to note that these groups are such that $ |\mathrm{cv}(\chi)|\leqslant 4 $ for all $ \chi \in \mathrm{Irr}(G) $. Lastly, we consider finite groups $ G $ with $ |\mathrm{cv}(G)\setminus \mathrm{cd}(G)|=3 $. For nilpotent groups, we obtain a characterization which is also connected to the work of Berkovich, Chillag and Zhmud. For non-nilpotent groups, we obtain the structure of $ G $ when $ \mathrm{dl}(G)=2 $.</description>

      <title>On the Length of a Maximal Subgroup of a Finite Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$ and its maximal subgroup $M$ we proved that the generalized Fitting height of $M$ can't be less by 2 than the generalized Fitting height of $G$ and the non-$p$-soluble length of $M$ can't be less by 1 than the non-$p$-soluble length of $G$. We constructed a hereditary saturated formation $\mathfrak{F}$ such that $\{n_\sigma(G, \mathfrak{F})-n_\sigma(M, \mathfrak{F})\mid G$ is finite $\sigma$-soluble and $M$ is a maximal subgroup of $G\}=\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ where $n_\sigma(G, \mathfrak{F})$ denotes the $\sigma$-nilpotent length of the $\mathfrak{F}$-residual of $G$. This construction shows the results about the generalized lengths of maximal subgroups published in Math. Nachr. (1994) and Mathematics (2020) are not correct.</description>

      <title>On Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture for non-uniform cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture for a group $G$ states that it is impossible for cellular automata (CA) over the universe $G$ with finite alphabet to produce strict embeddings of the full shift into itself. A group universe $G$ satisfying Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture is called a surjunctive group. The surjunctivity theorem of Gromov and Weiss shows that every sofic group is surjunctive. In this paper, we study the surjunctivity of local perturbations of CA and more generally of non-uniform cellular automata (NUCA) with finite memory and uniformly bounded singularity over surjunctive group universes. In particular, we show that such a NUCA must be invertible whenever it is reversible. We also obtain similar results which extend to the class of NUCA a certain dual-surjunctivity theorem of Capobianco, Kari, and Taati for CA.</description>

      <title>Constructing Chayet-Garibaldi algebras from affine vertex algebras (including the 3876-dimensional algebra for $E_8$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2021, Maurice Chayet and Skip Garibaldi provided an explicit construction of a commutative non-associative algebra on the second smallest representation of $E_8$ (of dimension $3875$) adjoined with a unit. In fact, they define such an algebra $A(\mathfrak{g})$ for each simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, in terms of explicit but ad-hoc formulas.
  We discovered that their algebras $A(\mathfrak{g})$ have a natural interpretation in terms of affine vertex algebras, and their ad-hoc formulas take an extremely simple form in this new interpretation. It is our hope that this point of view will lead to a better understanding of this interesting class of algebras.</description>

Abstract: We build the first example of a hyperbolic 6-manifold that admits a perfect circle-valued Morse function, which can be considered as the analogue of a fibration over the circle for manifolds with non-vanishing Euler characteristic. As a consequence, we obtain a new example of a subgroup of a hyperbolic group which is of type $\mathcal{F}_2$ but not $\mathcal{F}_3$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we provide an algebraic characterization of those stratified groups in which boundaries with locally constant normal are locally flat. We show that these groups, which we call hypergenerated, are exactly the stratified groups where embeddings of non-characteristic hypersurfaces are locally bi-Lipschitz. Finally, we extend these results to submanifolds of arbitrary codimension.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a relative solidity property for the product of a nonamenable biexact group with an arbitrary infinite group in the measure equivalence setting. Among other applications, we obtain the following unique product decomposition for products of nonamenable biexact groups, strengthening \cite{Sa09}: for any nonamenable biexact groups $\Gamma_1,\cdots, \Gamma_n$, if a product group $\Lambda_1\times \Lambda_2$ is measure equivalent to $\times_{k=1}^n\Gamma_k$, then there exists a partition $T_1\sqcup T_2=\{1,\dots, n\}$ such that $\Lambda_i$ is measure equivalent to $\times_{k\in T_i}\Gamma_k$ for $i=1,2$.</description>

      <title>A graphical description of the BNS-invariants of Bestvina-Brady groups and the RAAG recognition problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finitely presented Bestvina-Brady group (BBG) admits a presentation involving only commutators. We show that if a graph admits a certain type of spanning trees, then the associated BBG is a right-angled Artin group (RAAG). As an application, we obtain that the class of BBGs contains the class of RAAGs. On the other hand, we provide a criterion to certify that certain finitely presented BBGs are not isomorphic to RAAGs (or more general Artin groups). This is based on a description of the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariants of finitely presented BBGs in terms of separating subgraphs, analogous to the case of RAAGs. As an application, we characterize when the BBG associated to a 2-dimensional flag complex is a RAAG in terms of certain subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the commuting graph</title>

Abstract: The commuting graph of a group $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the elements of $G$, two distinct vertices joined if they commute.
  Our purpose in this paper is twofold: we discuss the computational problem of deciding whether a given graph is the commuting graph of a finite group; we give a quasipolynomial algorithm, and a polynomial algorithm for the case when the group is an extra\-special p-group for p an odd prime; we give new results on the question of whether the commuting graph of a given group is a cograph or a chordal graph, two classes of graphs defined by forbidden subgraphs.
  The problems are not unrelated, since there are a number of cases where hard computational problems on graphs are easier when restricted to special classes of graphs; we conjecture that the recognition problem is polynomial for cographs and chordal graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the finite basis problem for 4-element additively idempotent semirings whose additive reducts are semilattices of height 1. Up to isomorphism, there are 58 such algebras. We show that 49 of them are finitely based and the remaining ones are nonfinitely based.</description>

      <title>An inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle and applications to van der Corput sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00885v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain an inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle in the setting of countable cancellative, amenable semigroups. Besides being of intrinsic interest on its own, this result allows us to answer a variety of questions concerning sets of recurrence and van der Corput (vdC) sets, which were posed by Bergelson and Lesigne \cite{BL}, Bergelson and Ferr\'e Moragues \cite{BF}, Kelly and L\^e \cite{KL}, and Moreira \cite{Mor}. We also prove a spectral characterization of vdC sets and prove some of their basic properties in the context of countable amenable groups.
  Several results in this article were independently found by Sohail Farhangi and Robin Tucker-Drob, see \cite{FT}.</description>

      <title>On pre-Lie rings related to some non-Lazard braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let A be a brace of cardinality $p^{n}$ for some prime number $p$. Suppose that either (i) the additive group of brace $A$ has rank smaller than $p-3$, or (ii) $A^{\frac {p-1}2}\subseteq pA$ or (iii) $p^{i}A$ is an ideal in in $A$ for each $i$.
  It is shown that there is a pre-Lie ring associated to brace $A$. The left nilpotency index of this pre-Lie ring can be arbitrarily large.
  Let $A$ be a brace of cardinality $p^{n}$ for some prime number $p$. Denote $ann(p^{i})=\{a\in A: p^{i}a=0\}$.
  Suppose that for $i=1,2,\ldots $ and all $a,b\in A$ we have
  \[a*(a*(\cdots *a*b))\in pA, a*(a*(\cdots *a*ann(p^{i})))\in ann(p^{i-1})\] where $a$ appears less than $\frac {p-1}4$ times in this expression.
  Let $k$ be such that $p^{k(p-1)}A=0$. It is shown that the brace $A/ann(p^{4k})$ is obtained from a left nilpotent pre-Lie ring by a formula which depends only on the additive group of brace $A$. We also obtain some applications of this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p&gt;3$ be a prime number and let $A$ be a brace whose additive group is a direct sum of cyclic groups of cardinalities larger than $p^{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha $. Suppose that either (i) $A^{\lfloor{\frac {p-1}4}\rfloor}\subseteq pA$ or that (ii) the additive group of brace $A$ has rank smaller than ${\lfloor{\frac {p-1}4}\rfloor}$. It is shown that for every natural number $i\leq \alpha- {\frac {4\alpha }{p-1}}$ the factor brace $A/p^{i}A$ is obtained by a formula similar to the group of flows from a left nilpotent pre-Lie ring.</description>

      <title>A Lie group corresponding to the free Lie algebra and its universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the real free Lie algebra $\mathfrak{fr}_n$ with generators $\omega_1$, \dots, $\omega_n$. Since it is positively graded, it has a completion $\overline{\mathfrak{fr}}_n$ consisting of formal series. By the Campbell--Hausdorff formula, we have a corresponding Lie group $\overline{\mathrm{Fr}}_n$. It is the set $\exp\bigl(\overline{\mathfrak{fr}}_n\bigr)$ in the completed universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{fr}_n$. Also, the group $\overline{\mathrm{Fr}}_n$ is a 'submanifold' in the algebra of formal associative noncommutative series in $\omega_1$, \dots, $\omega_n$, the 'submanifold' is determined by a certain system of quadratic equations. We consider a certain dense subgroup $\mathrm{Fr}_n^\infty\subset \overline{\mathrm{Fr}}_n$ with a stronger (Polish) topology and show that any homomorphism $\pi$ from $\mathfrak{fr}_n$ to a real finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ can be integrated in a unique way to a homomorphism $\Pi$ from $\mathrm{Fr}_n^\infty$ to the corresponding simply connected Lie group $G$. If $\pi$ is surjective, then $\Pi$ also is surjective. Note that Pestov (1993) constructed a separable Banach--Lie group such that any separable Banach--Lie group is its quotient.</description>

      <title>On linguistic subsets of groups and monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study subsets of groups and monoids defined by language-theoretic means, generalizing the classical approach to the word problem. We expand on results by Herbst from 1991 to a more general setting, and for a class of languages $\mathbf{C}$ we define the classes of $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flat and $\mathbf{C}^\exists$-flat groups. We prove several closure results for these classes of groups, prove a connection with the word problem, and characterize $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flat groups for several classes of languages. In general, we prove that the class of $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flat groups is a strict subclass of the class of groups with word problem in $\mathbf{C}$, including for the class $\mathbf{REC}$ of recursive languages, for which $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flatness for a group resp. monoid is proved to be equivalent to the decidability of the subgroup membership problem resp. the submonoid membership problem. We provide a number of examples, including the Tarski monsters of Ol'shanskii, showing the difficulty of characterizing $\mathbf{C}^\exists$-flat groups. As an application of our general methods, we also prove in passing that if $\mathbf{C}$ is a full semi-$\mathrm{AFL}$, then the class of epi-$\mathbf{C}$ groups is closed under taking finite index subgroups. This answers a question recently posed by Al Kohli, Bleak &amp; Elliott.</description>

      <title>Real spectrum compactification of Hitchin components, Weyl chamber valued lengths, and dual spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main result of this article is that Hitchin representations over real closed field extensions $\mathbb{F}$ of $\mathbb{R}$ correspond precisely to those representations of the fundamental group of a closed surface into $\textrm{PSL}(n,\mathbb{F})$ that are conjugate to $\mathbb{F}$-positive representations, i.e. representations that admit an equivariant limit map from the set of fixed points in the boundary of the universal cover of the surface into the set of full flags in $\mathbb{F}^n$ satisfying specific positivity properties. As the theorem treats general real closed fields, and not only the reals, the tools of analysis are not available. Instead, our proof is based on the Tarski-Seidenberg transfer principle and a multiplicative version of the Bonahon-Dreyer coordinates. We use this result to prove that $\mathbb{F}$-positive representations form semi-algebraically connected components of the space of all representations, that consist entirely of injective and discrete representations, which are positively hyperbolic and weakly dynamics-preserving over $\mathbb{F}$. Furthermore, we show how to associate intersection geodesic currents to $\mathbb{F}$-positive representations, and conclude with applications to the Weyl chamber length compactification and to dual spaces of geodesic currents.</description>

      <title>On n-dependent groups and fields III. Multilinear forms and invariant connected components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop some model theory of multi-linear forms, generalizing Granger in the bi-linear case. In particular, after proving a quantifier elimination result, we show that for an NIP field K, the theory of infinite dimensional non-degenerate alternating n-linear spaces over K is strictly n-dependent; and it is NSOP1 if K is. This relies on a new Composition Lemma for functions of arbitrary arity and NIP relations (which in turn relies on certain higher arity generalizations of Sauer-Shelah lemma). We also study the invariant connected components $G^{\infty}$ in n-dependent groups, demonstrating their relative absoluteness in the abelian case.</description>
