      <title>Leibniz rule for wedge product in discrete exterior calculus on general polygonal meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete exterior calculus offers a coordinate-free discretization of exterior calculus especially suited for computations on curved spaces. In this work, we present a wedge product on 2-dimensional pseudomanifolds, whose faces are any polygons. We prove that this polygonal wedge product is compatible with the discrete exterior derivative in the sense that it satisfies the Leibniz product rule. We thus extend previously studied discretizations of wedge products from simplicial or quadrilateral meshes to general polygonal surface meshes. We also prove that our discrete wedge product corresponds to a cup product of cochains on 2-pseudomanifolds.</description>

      <title>Exotic periodic phenomena in the cohomology of the moduli stack of $1$-dimensional formal group laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe some periodic structure in the cohomology of the moduli stack of 1-dimensional formal group laws, also known as the $E_2$-page of the classical Adams--Novikov spectral sequence. This structure is distinct from the familiar $v_n$-periodicities, and it displays interesting number-theoretic properties. Our techniques involve the $\mathbb{C}$-motivic Adams spectral sequence, and we obtain analogous periodic structure in $\mathbb{C}$-motivic stable homotopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of Spin-$G$ bordism groups, focusing on the interplay between Spin and additional twisting symmetries such as $Sp(4)$, $SU(8)$ and $Spin(16)$. Using techniques from spectral sequences, obstruction theory, and cohomology operations, we compute explicit generators for the Spin-$G$ bordism groups in dimensions up to 7.</description>

      <title>On minimal shapes and topological invariants in hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the set of finite shapes with minimal perimeter on hyperbolic lattices given by regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane whose tiles are regular $p$-gons meeting at vertices of degree $q$, with $1/p+1/q&lt;\frac{1}{2}$. The main tool is a layer decomposition due to Rietman--Nienhuis--Oitmaa and Moran, which allows us to prove convergence towards the Cheeger constant when these shapes exhaust the lattice. Furthermore, we apply a celebrated result of Floyd--Plotnick, which will allow us to compute the Euler characteristic for these graphs in terms of certain growth functions and the number of $n$-sized animals on those lattices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize Blumberg-Mandell's K-theoretic Poitou-Tate duality to arithmetic schemes of arbitrary dimension, smooth and proper over S-integers. As in our earlier papers on the subject, we discuss how to model the compactly supported side via the K-theory of locally compact modules.</description>

      <title>The Mid-sphere Cousin of the Medial Axis Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The medial axis of a smoothly embedded surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consists of all points for which the Euclidean distance function on the surface has at least two minima. We generalize this notion to the mid-sphere axis, which consists of all points for which the Euclidean distance function has two interchanging saddles that swap their partners in the pairing by persistent homology. It offers a discrete-algebraic multi-scale approach to computing ridge-like structures on the surface. As a proof of concept, an algorithm that computes stair-case approximations of the mid-sphere axis is provided.</description>

      <title>Topological $\Delta G$ homology of rings with twisted $G$-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unifying framework for studying variants of topological Hochschild homology such as Real topological Hochschild homology. Associated to a crossed simplicial group $\Delta G$, a category that generalizes Connes' cyclic category, we introduce an invariant of rings with twisted $G$-action, which we call topological $\Delta G$-homology. Here a ring with twisted $G$-action is a common generalization of a ring with involution and a ring with $G$-action.
  Our construction provides homotopical analogues of quaternionic homology, symmetric homology, braid homology, and hyperoctahedral homology defined by Fiedorowicz--Loday. In the quaternionic case our construction, called quaternionic topological Hochschild homology, is equipped with a left Pin(2)-action and we compute it for loop spaces with a twisted $C_4$-action. As an important step along the way, we introduce a new family of crossed simplicial groups called the twisted symmetric crossed simplicial groups and we prove that they corresponds to operads for algebras with twisted $G$-action.</description>

      <title>On the Birman exact sequence of the subgroups of the mapping class group of genus three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any finite index subgroup of the mapping class group containing the Johnson subgroup, the profinite Birman exact sequence does not split in genus $g\ge 3$, extending prior results of Hain and the second author for $g\ge 4$. For the Torelli group, we prove that the graded Lie algebra version of the Birman exact sequence admits no section with symplectic equivariance, extending Hain's result from $g\ge 4$ to $g=3$. These results are deduced by our main tool, relative completion, with the help of Hodge theory and representation theory of symplectic groups, along with explicit structural obstructions coming from hyperelliptic mapping class groups.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any element in the $\gamma$-completion of the space of smooth compact exact Lagrangian submanifolds of a cotangent bundle, if its $\gamma$-support is a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, then the element itself is a smooth Lagrangian. We also prove that if the $\gamma$-support of an element in the completion is compact, then it is connected.</description>

      <title>Equilevel algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An equilevel algebra is a subalgebra of the space of smooth functions $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ distinguished in this space by finitely many conditions of the type $f(x_i) = f(\tilde x_i)$, $x_i \neq \tilde x_i \in M$, or approximated by such subalgebras. For $M = S^1$ or ${\mathbb R}^1$, the regular points of the variety of equilevel algebras of codimension $k$ are known in knot theory as $k$-chord diagrams. The whole of this variety completes the space of chord diagrams in the same way as the Hilbert schemes complete the configuration spaces. We describe cell structures of the varieties of all equilevel algebras up to the codimension three in the space $C^\infty(S^1, {\mathbb R})$ and compute their homology groups and characteristic classes of canonical vector bundles on them.</description>

      <title>A universal characteristic class for vector bundles with a connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper I introduce a new characteristic class $c(E)$ for a finite rank vector bundle $E$ on an affine scheme $S:=Spec(A)$ - the fundamental class of $E$. The class $c(E)$ is not a characteristic class in the classical sense in the sense that it lives in a pointed cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$. Most characteristic classes lives in a cohomology group. The pointed cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is a torsor on the abelian group $\operatorname{H}^2(L, Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E)))$ where $Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is the center of the ring of endomorphisms of $E$ and where the cohomology is the Lie-Rinehart cohomology of the center. The class $c(E)$ is trivial if and only if $E$ has a flat algebraic connection. Hence the class $c(T_S)$ where $T_S$ is the tangent bundle, is an an obstruction for $S$ to be algebraically parallelizable. I use a connection $\nabla$ to define $c(E)$ and I also prove the class $c(E)$ is independent of choice of connection, hence $c(E)$ is an invariant of the vector bundle $E$. The class generalize the Chern class, the Pontryagin class, the Euler class and the Teleman characteristic class. I prove using an explicit example that the class $c(E)$ is stronger than the Chern class and the Euler class. I also give a new proof of a formula for the curvature of a connection $\nabla$ in terms of an idempotent endomorphism $\phi$ defining $E$. This formula was claimed and proved in a paper put out on the arXiv in 2011, and in this paper I give a new proof that is easier to read. The class may be interesting in the study of the "cancellation problem" in affine algebraic geometry and the problem of giving algebraic formulas for the topological Euler characteristic. I also calculate the algebraic deRham cohomology of the complex two sphere and prove it is infinite dimensional.</description>

      <title>The Topological Structures of the Orders of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide first a categorical exploration of, and then completion of the mapping of the relationships among, three fundamental perspectives on binary relations: as the incidence matrices of hypergraphs, as the formal contexts of concept lattices, and as specifying topological cosheaves of simplicial (Dowker) complexes on simplicial (Dowker) complexes. We provide an integrative, functorial framework combining previously known with three new results: 1) given a binary relation, there are order isomorphisms among the bounded edge order of the intersection complexes of its dual hypergraphs and its concept lattice; 2) the concept lattice of a context is an isomorphism invariant of the Dowker cosheaf (of abstract simplicial complexes) of that context; and 3) a novel Dowker cosheaf (of chain complexes) of a relation is an isomorphism invariant of the concept lattice of the context that generalizes Dowker's original homological result. We illustrate these concepts throughout with a running example, and demonstrate relationships to past results.</description>
