      <title>Profiles of Critical Flat Ribbon Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main open problem in geometric knot theory is to provide a tabulation of knots based on an energy criterion, with the goal of presenting this tabulation in terms of global energy minimisers within isotopy classes, often referred to as ideal knots. Recently, the first examples of minimal length diagrams and their corresponding length values have been determined by Ayala, Kirszenblat, and Rubinstein. This article is motivated by the scarcity of examples despite several decades of intense research. Here, we compute the minimal ribbonlength for some well-known knot diagrams, including the Salomon knot and the Turk's head knot. We also determine the minimal ribbonlength for the granny knot and square knot using a direct method. We conclude by providing the ribbonlength for infinite classes of critical ribbon knots, along with conjectures aimed at relating ribbonlength to knot invariants in pursuit of a metric classification of knots.</description>

      <title>Graph quandles: Generalized Cayley graphs of racks and right quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve two open problems of Valeriy Bardakov about Cayley graphs of racks and graph-theoretic realizations of right quasigroups. We also extend Didier Caucal's classification of labeled Cayley digraphs to right quasigroups and related algebraic structures like quandles.
  First, we characterize markings of graphs that realize racks. As an application, we construct rack-theoretic (di)graph invariants from permutation representations of graph automorphism groups. We describe how to compute these invariants with general results for path graphs and cycle graphs.
  Second, we show that all right quasigroups are realizable by edgeless graphs and complete (di)graphs. Using Schreier (di)graphs, we also characterize Cayley (di)graphs of right quasigroups Q that realize Q. In particular, all racks are realizable by their full Cayley (di)graphs.
  Finally, we give a graph-theoretic characterization of labeled Cayley digraphs of right-cancellative magmas, right-divisible magmas, right quasigroups, racks, quandles, involutory racks, and kei.</description>

      <title>Geometric Constraints in Link Isotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of families of distinct isotopy classes of physical unknots through the key concept of parametrised thickness. These unknots have prescribed length, tube thickness, a uniform bound on curvature, and cannot be disentangled into a thickened round circle by an isotopy that preserves these constraints throughout. In particular, we establish the existence of \emph{gordian unknots}: embedded tubes that are topologically trivial but geometrically locked, confirming a long-standing conjecture. These arise within the space $\mathcal{U}_1$ of thin unknots in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and persist across a stratified family $\{ \mathcal{U}_\tau \}_{\tau \in [0,2]}$, where $\tau$ denotes the tube diameter, or thickness. The constraints on curvature and self-distance fragment the isotopy class of the unknot into infinitely many disconnected components, revealing a stratified structure governed by geometric thresholds. This unveils a rich hierarchy of geometric entanglement within topologically trivial configurations.</description>

      <title>Gordian split links in the Gehring ropelength problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thick link is a link in Euclidean three-space such that each component of the link lies at distance at least 1 from every other component. Strengthening the notion of thickness, we define a thickly embedded link to be a thick link whose open radius-1/2 normal disk bundles of all components are embedded. The Gehring ropelength problem asks how large the sum of the lengths of the components of a thick (respectively thickly embedded) link must be, given the link homotopy (respectively isotopy) class of the link. A thick homotopy (isotopy) is a link homotopy (isotopy) of a thick (thickly embedded) link that preserves thickness throughout, and such that during the homotopy the total length of the link never exceeds the initial total length. These notions of thick homotopy and isotopy are more permissive than other notions of physical link isotopies in which the length of each individual component must remain constant (no "length trading"). We construct an explicit example of a thickly embedded 4-component link which is topologically split but cannot be split by a thick homotopy, and thick links in every homotopy class with 2 components that are non-global local minima for ropelength. This is the first time such local minima for ropelength have been explicitly constructed. In particular, we construct a thick 2-component link in the link homotopy class of the unlink which cannot be split through a thick homotopy.</description>

      <title>Vanishing arcs for isolated plane curve singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variation operator associated with an isolated hypersurface singularity is a classical topological invariant that relates relative and absolute homologies of the Milnor fiber via a non trivial isomorphism. Here we work with a topological version of this operator that deals with proper arcs and closed curves instead of homology cycles. Building on the classical framework of geometric vanishing cycles, we introduce the concept of vanishing arcsets as their counterpart using this geometric variation operator. We characterize which properly embedded arcs are sent to geometric vanishing cycles by the geometric variation operator in terms of intersections numbers of the arcs and their images by the geometric monodromy. Furthermore, we prove that for any distinguished collection of vanishing cycles arising from an A'Campo's divide, there exists a topological exceptional collection of arcsets whose variation images match this collection.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Infinite Ideal Polyhedra in Hyperbolic 3-Space via Combinatorial Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his seminal work \cite{Ri96}, Rivin characterized finite ideal polyhedra in three-dimensional hyperbolic space. However, the characterization of infinite ideal polyhedra, as proposed by Rivin, has remained a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we introduce the combinatorial Ricci flow for infinite ideal circle patterns, a discrete analogue of Ricci flow on non-compact Riemannian manifolds, and prove a characterization of such circle patterns under certain combinatorial conditions. Our results provide affirmative solutions to Rivin's problem.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff Dimension of non-conical and Myrberg limit sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop techniques to study the Hausdorff dimensions of non-conical and Myrberg limit sets for groups acting on negatively curved spaces. We establish maximality of the Hausdorff dimension of the non-conical limit set of $G$ in the following cases. 1. $M$ is a finite volume complete Riemannian manifold of pinched negative curvature and $G$ is an infinite normal subgroups of infinite index in $\pi_1(M)$. 2. $G$ acts on a regular tree $X$ with $X/G$ infinite and amenable (dimension 1). 3. $G$ acts on the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb H^2$ such that $\mathbb H^2/G$ has Cheeger constant zero (dimension 2). 4. $G$ is a finitely generated geometrically infinite Kleinian group (dimension 3). We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of the Myrberg limit set is the same as the critical exponent, confirming a conjecture of Falk-Matsuzaki.</description>

      <title>A model for the assembly map of bordism-invariant functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study oplax colimits of stable categories, of hermitian categories and of Poincar\'e categories in nice cases. This allows us to produce a categorical model of the assembly map of a bordism-invariant functor of Poincar\'e categories which is also a Verdier projection, whose kernel we explicitly describe. As a direct application, we generalize the Shaneson splitting for bordism-invariant functors of Poincar\'e categories proved by Calm\`es-Dotto-Harpaz-Hebestreit-Land-Moi-Nardin-Nikolaus-Steimle to allow for twists. We also show our methods can tackle their general twisted Shaneson splitting of Poincar\'e-Verdier localizing invariants which specifies to a twisted Bass-Heller-Swan decomposition for the underlying stable categories, generalizing part of recent work of Kirstein-Kremer.</description>

      <title>Thin Gordian Unlinks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A gordian unlink is a finite number of unknots that are not topologically linked, each with prescribed length and thickness, and that cannot be disentangled into the trivial link by an isotopy preserving length and thickness throughout.
  In this note, we provide the first examples of gordian unlinks. As a consequence, we identify the existence of isotopy classes of unknots that differ from those in classical knot theory. More generally, we present a one-parameter family of gordian unlinks with thickness ranging in $[1,2)$ and absolute curvature bounded by 1, concluding that thinner normal tubes lead to different rope geometries than those previously considered. Knots or links in the one-parameter model introduced here are called thin knots or links. When the thickness is equal to 2, we obtain the standard model for geometric knots, also called thick knots.</description>

Abstract: We partially determine grid homology (combinatorial knot Floer homology) of diagonal knots, which are conjectured to be equivalent to positive braid knots, by exploiting nice grid diagrams. We compare diagonal knots to various classes of knots, such as positive braids, fibered positive knots, and $L$-space knots.</description>

      <title>Curvature, macroscopic dimensions, and symmetric products of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01779v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Posets arising from decompositions of objects in a monoidal category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a symmetric monoidal category $C$ with product $\sqcup$, where the neutral element for the product is an initial object, we consider the poset of $\sqcup$-complemented subobjects of a given object $X$. When this poset has finite height, we define decompositions and partial decompositions of $X$ which are coherent with $\sqcup$, and order them by refinement. From these posets, we define complexes of frames and partial bases, augmented Bergman complexes and related ordered versions. We propose a unified approach to the study of their combinatorics and homotopy type, establishing various properties and relations between them. Via explicit homotopy formulas, we will be able to transfer structural properties, such as Cohen-Macaulayness.
  In well-studied scenarios, the poset of $\sqcup$-complemented subobjects specializes to the poset of free factors of a free group, the subspace poset of a vector space, the poset of non-degenerate subspaces of a vector space with a non-degenerate form, and the lattice of flats of a matroid. The decomposition and partial decomposition posets, the complex of frames and partial bases together with the ordered versions, either coincide with well-known structures, generalize them, or yield new interesting objects. In these particular cases, we provide new results along with open questions and conjectures.</description>

Abstract: We define the HOMFLY polynomial of a forest quiver $Q$ using a recursive definition on the underlying graph of the quiver. We then show that this polynomial is equal to the HOMFLY polynomial of any plabic link which comes from a connected plabic graph whose quiver is $Q$. We also prove a closed-form expression for the HOMFLY polynomial of a forest quiver $Q$ in terms of the independent sets of $Q$.</description>
