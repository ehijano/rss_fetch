      <title>Exploring the Cauchy-Riemann structure and integrability conditions of $F$-structures satisfying $\alpha F^{K+1} +\beta F^{K} + F=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of $F$-structures satisfying $\alpha F^{K+1} +\beta F^{K} + F=0$, where $K$ is a positive integer, $K\geq3$, and $\alpha, \beta$ are real or complex numbers. We investigate the Cauchy-Riemann structure and its link with the $F$-structure. We also address the integrability of this structure, including partial and complete integrability. Finally, we present several examples of the $F$-structure.</description>

      <title>Ancient curve shortening flow in the disc with mixed boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any non-central interior point $o$ of the unit disc $D$, the diameter $L$ through $o$ is the union of two linear arcs emanating from $o$ which meet $\partial D$ orthogonally, the shorter of them stable and the longer unstable (under these boundary conditions). In each of the two half discs bounded by $L$, we construct a convex eternal solution to curve shortening flow which fixes $o$ and meets $\partial D$ orthogonally, and evolves out of the unstable critical arc at $t=-\infty$ and into the stable one at $t=+\infty$. We then prove that these two (congruent) solutions are the only non-flat convex ancient solutions to the curve shortening flow satisfying the specified boundary conditions. We obtain analogous conclusions in the "degenerate" case $o\in\partial D$ as well, although in this case the solution contracts to the point $o$ at a finite time with asymptotic shape that of a half Grim Reaper, thus providing an interesting example for which an embedded flow develops a collapsing singularity.</description>

      <title>Random 3-Manifolds Have No Totally Geodesic Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Murphy and the second author showed that a generic closed Riemannian manifold has no totally geodesic submanifolds, provided it is at least four dimensional. Lytchak and Petrunin established the same thing in dimension 3. For the higher dimensional result, the generic set is open and dense in the $C^{q}$--topology for any $% q\geq 2.$ In Lytchak and Petrunin's work, the generic set is a dense $G_{\delta }$ in the $C^{q}$-topology for any $q\geq 2.$ Here we show that the set of such metrics on a compact $3$-manifold contains a set that is open and dense in the $C^{q}$-topology for any $q\geq 3.$</description>

      <title>On open manifolds admitting no complete metric with positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological obstruction problem for positive scalar curvature and uniformly positive scalar curvature on open manifolds. We present a definition for open Schoen-Yau-Schick manifolds and prove that there is no complete metric with positive scalar curvature on these manifolds. Similarly, we define weak Schoen-Yau-Shick manifolds by analogy, which are expected to admit no complete metrics with uniformly positive scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Sub-Riemannian optimal synthesis for Carnot groups with the structure of a path geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explicitly constructs the complete set of optimal sub-Riemannian geodesics starting from a point for certain Carnot groups of step two. These are groups of dimension 2n+1 equipped with a left-invariant distribution of dimension n+1 such that at each point, there is a unique direction defining a nontrivial Lie bracket. A suitable explicit expression of geodesics, together with symmetries of the structure, allows us to identify the cut time and the cut locus by applying the so-called extended Hadamard technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to study triharmonic curves in the 3-dimensional homogeneous space Sol. In the first part of the paper we shall obtain a complete classification of proper triharmonic curves with constant geodesic curvature and torsion. In the final section we shall show that these triharmonic curves form a constant angle with a suitable Killing field of constant length along the curve.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we provide a very simple proof of the uniformization theorem of Riemann surfaces by Ricci flow. The argument builds on a refinement of Hamilton's isoperimetric estimate for the Ricci flow on the two-sphere.</description>

      <title>Classification of superpotentials for cohomogeneity one Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify superpotentials for the Hamiltonian system corresponding to the cohomogeneity one gradient Ricci soliton equations. Aside from recovering known examples of superpotentials for steady solitons, we find a new superpotential on a specific case of the B\'erard-Bergery-Calabi ansatz. The latter is used to obtain an explicit formula for a steady complete soliton with an equidistant family of hypersurfaces given by circle bundles over $S^2\times S^2$. There are no superpotentials in the non-steady case in dimensions greater than 2, even if polynomial coefficients are allowed. We also briefly discuss generalised first integrals and the limitations of some known methods of finding them.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions to the generalized dual Minkowski problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a real number $q$ and a star body in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, the generalized dual curvature measure of a convex body was introduced by Lutwak-Yang-Zhang [43]. The corresponding generalized dual Minkowski problem is studied in this paper. By using variational methods, we solve the generalized dual Minkowski problem for $q&lt;0$, and the even generalized dual Minkowski problem for $0\leq q\leq1$. We also obtain a sufficient condition for the existence of solutions to the even generalized dual Minkowski problem for $1&lt;q&lt;n$.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the geometry and topology of expanding horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend some basic results about marginally outer trapped surfaces to the context of surfaces having general null expansion. Motivated in part by recent work of Chai-Wan, we introduce the notion of $\mathfrak{g}$-stability for a general closed hypersurface $\Sigma$ in an ambient initial data set and prove that, under natural energy conditions, $\Sigma$ has positive Yamabe type, that is, $\Sigma$ admits a metric of positive scalar curvature, provided $\Sigma$ is $\mathfrak{g}$-stable. Similar results are obtained when $\Sigma$ is embedded in a spacelike, or null, hypersurface of a spacetime satisfying the dominant energy condition. Conditions implying $\mathfrak{g}$-stability are also discussed. Finally, we obtain a spacetime positive mass theorem for initial data sets with compact boundary $\Sigma$ of positive null expansion, assuming that the dominant energy condition is sufficiently strict near $\Sigma$. This extends recent results of Galloway-Lee and Lee-Lesourd-Unger.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures in Lagrangian Floer cohomology modelled on differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a structure of an algebra on the Lagrangian Floer cohomology of a Lagrangian submanifold over the quantum cohomology of the ambient symplectic manifold. The structure is analogous to the one defined by Biran-Cornea, but is constructed in the differential forms model. In the spirit of Ganatra and Hugtenburg, we define another such algebra structure using a closed-open map. We show that the two structures coincide. As an application, we show that the module structure for the 2-dimensional Clifford torus is given by multiplication by a Novikov coefficient, similarly to the Biran-Cornea module structure for this case.</description>

      <title>Mean curvature flow with generic initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the mean curvature flow of generic closed surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ avoids asymptotically conical and non-spherical compact singularities. We also show that the mean curvature flow of generic closed low-entropy hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ is smooth until it disappears in a round point. The main technical ingredient is a long-time existence and uniqueness result for ancient mean curvature flows that lie on one side of asymptotically conical or compact shrinking solitons.</description>

      <title>Third-order affine-invariant (systems of) PDEs in two independent variables as vanishing of the Fubini-Pick invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If one imposes that a $3^{\mathrm{rd}}$ order PDE $\mathcal{E}:=\{F(x,y,u,u_x,\dots,u_{xyy},u_{yyy})=0\}$ in two independent variables $x,y$ and one unknown function $u$ be invariant with respect to the group of affine transformation $\mathrm{Aff}(3)$ of $\mathbb{R}^3=\{(x,y,u)\}$, then it turns out that there is (up to a nowhere zero factor) only one choice of $F$. In this paper we study more in depth the geometry behind the occurrence of such a PDE: after proving the relationship of $F$ with the Fubini-Pick invariant, we derive $\mathcal{E}$ by using a general method introduced in [D.V. Alekseevsky, J. Gutt, G. Manno, and G. Moreno: A general method to construct invariant {PDEs} on homogeneous manifolds. Communications in Contemporary Mathematics (2021)], which sheds light on some of its geometrical properties.</description>

      <title>Counting geodesics on compact symmetric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.11984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the inverse image of the Riemannian exponential map at a basepoint of a compact symmetric space as the disjoint union of so called focal orbits through a maximal torus. These are orbits of a subgroup of the isotropy group acting in the tangent space at the basepoint. We show how their dimensions (infinitesimal data) and connected components (topological data) are encoded in the diagram, multiplicities, Weyl group and lattice of the symmetric space. Obtaining this data is precisely what we mean by counting geodesics. This extends previous results on compact Lie groups. We apply our results to give short independent proofs of known results on compact symmetric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The twisted suspension of a manifold is obtained by surgery along the fibre of a principal circle bundle over the manifold. It generalizes the spinning operation for knots and preserves various topological properties. In this article, we show that Riemannian metrics of positive Ricci curvature can be lifted along twisted suspensions. As an application we show that the maximal symmetry rank of a closed, simply-connected Riemannian manifold of positive Ricci curvature is $(n-2)$ in all dimensions $n\geq 4$. Further applications include simply-connected 6-manifolds whose homology has torsion, (rational) homology spheres in all dimensions at least 4, and manifolds with prescribed third homology.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to construct foliations $\mathcal{F}$ that are stable, meaning that any other foliation close to $\mathcal{F}$ is conjugate to $\mathcal{F}$ by a diffeomorphism. Our main result yields examples of stable Riemannian foliations $\mathcal{F}$ with dense leaves. To our knowledge, these are the first examples of stable Riemannian foliations that are not Hausdorff.</description>
