      <title>Clock Pulling Enables Maximum-Efficiency Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear parity-time (PT) symmetry in non-Hermitian wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, while attracting significant attention from both physics and engineering communities, have posed formidable theoretical and practical challenges due to their complex dynamical mechanisms. Here, we revisit multistability in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems and find that the PT-symmetry state is not always stable even in PT-symmetry phase. We report a discovery on a nonlinear clock-pulling mechanism, which can forcibly break the PT symmetry. Proper implementation of this mechanism can switch the system stability, particularly in stabilizing the conventional unstable state which has the maximum transfer efficiency for WPT. Our work offers new tools for non-Hermitian physics and is expected to drive technological progress.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of commercial SiC MOSFETs at deep-cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with an emerging CMOS technology platform and it is widely deployed in high power and harsh environment electronics. This material is also attracting interest for quantum technologies through its crystal defects, which can act as spin-based qubits or single-photon sources. In this work, we assess the cryogenic performance of commercial power MOSFETs to evaluate their suitability for CMOS-compatible quantum electronics. We perform a statistical study of threshold voltage and subthreshold swing from 300 K down to 650 mK, focusing on reproducibility and variability. Our results show significant performance degradation at low temperatures, including large gate hysteresis, threshold voltage shifts, and subthreshold swing deterioration. These effects suggest instability in electrostatic control, likely due to carrier freeze-out and high interface trap density, which may pose challenges for the reliable use of this transistor technology towards the realisation of quantum devices or cryo-CMOS electronics.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation in an elastic lattice with non-reciprocal stiffness and engineered damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal wave propagation allows for directional energy transport. In this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice that combines nonreciprocal stiffness with viscous damping. After establishing how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate, while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves and boundary-induced wave mixing. These findings provide a theoretical framework for designing active metamaterials with more versatile control over their wave propagation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of Angular Momentum Transport Across Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:1604.01714v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angular momentum transport in magnetic multilayered structures plays a central role in spintronic physics and devices. The angular momentum currents or spin currents are carried by either quasi-particles such as electrons and magnons, or by macroscopic order parameters such as local magnetization of ferromagnets. Based on the generic interface exchange interaction, we develop a microscopic theory that describes interfacial spin conductance for various interfaces among non-magnetic metals, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic insulators. Spin conductance and its temperature dependence are obtained for different spin batteries including spin pumping, temperature gradient and spin Hall effect. As an application of our theory, we calculate the spin current in a trilayer made of a ferromagnetic insulator, an antiferromagnetic insulator and a non-magnetic heavy metal. The calculated results on the temperature dependence of spin conductance quantitatively agree with the existing experiments.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis and Local Influence Diagnostics for an Extreme-Value Regression Model of Anomalous Wind Gusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme events in complex physical systems, such as anomalous wind gusts, often cause significant material and human damage. Their modeling is crucial for risk assessment and understanding the underlying dynamics. In this work, we introduce a local influence analysis to assess the stability of a class of extreme-value Birnbaum-Saunders regression models, which are particularly suited for analyzing such data. The proposed approach uses the conformal normal curvature (CNC) of the log-likelihood function to diagnose the influence of individual observations on the postulated model. By examining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with the CNC, we identify influential data points-physical events that disproportionately affect the model's parameters. We illustrate the methodology through a simulation study and apply it to a time series of wind gust data from Itajai, Brazil, where a severe event caused multiple damages and casualties. Our approach successfully pinpoints this specific event as a highly influential observation and quantifies its impact on the fitted model. This work provides a valuable diagnostic tool for physicists and data scientists working with extreme-value models of complex natural phenomena.</description>

      <title>Impact of Proton Irradiation on 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) particle detectors have the potential to provide time resolutions and robust performance in extreme environments which exceed that of silicon detectors. In this work 4H-SiC low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs) and complementary PiN diodes were irradiated with 2.5 GeV protons at fluences up to 3.33$\times$10$^{14}$ p/cm$^2$. The electrostatic performance of both irradiated and non-irradiated devices was evaluated using current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Moreover, charge collection measurements using $\alpha$ particles were also conducted. SiC LGADs displayed a loss in rectification and gain with increasing proton fluence. Additionally, the reduction in capacitance and OFF-state current pointed to compensation of the gain layer as a gain reducing mechanism. The introduction of radiation induced defects also hinders carrier acceleration reducing impact ionization, leading to further gain reduction. However, despite the reduction in device performance, the demonstration of a measurable signal and gain after irradiation points to the potential of SiC LGAD detectors for future high energy physics applications.</description>

      <title>Local-available quantum correlation swapping in one-parameter X states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although introduced originally for entanglement, quantum repeaters and swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such as quantum discord. Introduced by Mundarain and Ladr\'on de Guevara, local-available quantum correlations (LAQC) are a promising yet understudied quantum correlation. Recently, Bellor\'{\i}n et al. obtained exact analytical results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Starting from those previous results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for five families of one-parameter 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial state and the one used for the projective measurement are correlated, the final state will have non-zero LAQC.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limitations of Absolute Ranging via Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision absolute length metrology using laser interferometry faces inherent challenges from interferometric ambiguity. Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry (DFMI) addresses this by simultaneously extracting two distinct length-encoding parameters: the precise, ambiguous interferometric phase ($\Phi$) and the coarser, unambiguous effective modulation depth ($m$). This paper establishes the fundamental statistical and systematic limitations governing the absolute accuracy of DFMI. We detail two primary readout algorithms: a frequency-domain Non-Linear Least Squares (NLS) fit and a time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We derive the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the estimation of $m$ and $\Phi$, identifying intrinsic ``dead zones'' where precision degrades, and asymptotic limits as a function of signal quality and integration time, achievable by both NLS and EKF. Critically, we develop analytical models for dominant systematic biases, revealing previously uncharted ``valleys of robustness'' -- specific operating points where errors from modulation non-linearity and residual amplitude modulation are strongly suppressed. This analysis clarifies critical trade-offs between different design parameters, integration time, and total error, informing instrument design and underscoring the necessity of advanced compensation techniques for high-accuracy applications.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Light Coupling Control in Ultrathin Photonic Nanomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic layer materials have emerged as essential building blocks for next generation quantum and semiconductor technologies, where atomic scale control over light matter interactions is critical. However, their inherently small optical interaction volume poses fundamental challenges for efficient integration into quantum and nanophotonic devices. Addressing this limitation requires the development of photonic platforms that can effectively enhance atomic-scale optical coupling. To this end, air suspended nanomembranes with extreme thinness and minimal radiative loss offer an ideal framework for integrating atomic layer materials into photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate an ultrathin freestanding photonic nanomembrane with a thickness down to 29 nm comparable to that of atomic layer materials enabling atomic scale control of light coupling. This architecture supports strong field confinement at the surface and significantly enhances light matter interaction. Through the integration of atomic layer material, we achieve angstrom level thickness modulation, where a single atomic-layer-deposition cycle corresponding to a thickness increment of 0.65 angstrom results in a 0.09 nm shift in the high Q resonance. High-resolution spatial mapping further confirms uniform and deterministic resonance tuning across the nanomembrane surface. This approach provides a scalable and versatile route for atomic-scale light coupling, effectively overcoming the limitations of conventional photonics and enabling progress in quantum photonics, 2D optoelectronics, and advanced semiconductor technologies.</description>

      <title>Two-mode and dual-resonant planar photonic waveguides for efficient guiding and trapping of atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trapping of ultracold atoms using two-colour evanescent light waves formed by propagating modes of suspended optical rib waveguides is modelled in different configurations. Reducing the anisotropy of the two-colour evanescent optical dipole potential requires two laser light components with a large frequency difference. The upper frequency is guided in the two lowest transverse waveguide modes and the lower frequency propagates in a single-mode regime. This increases the dipole potential depth in the lateral direction. An additional increase in the optical dipole potential can be achieved by tuning the frequencies of the two modes to two different atomic transitions. When applied to rubidium, the total depth of the corresponding surface optical dipole traps can reach 0.3 mK or above under reasonable conditions.</description>

      <title>Low Temperature Formation of Crystalline VO2 Domains in Porous 1 Nanocolumnar Thin Films for Thermochromic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of VO2 crystalline domains in amorphous substoichiometric nanocolumnar VOx thin films subjected to an oxidation process at temperatures below 300{\deg}C has been studied. It is obtained that values of [O]/[V] above 1.9 lead to the sole formation of V2O5 after oxidation, while values below 1.9 favor the formation of VO2, V3O7 and V2O5 crystalline domains for temperatures as low as 260{\deg}C. Moreover, it is found that the adsorption of oxygen and its incorporation into the film network produce a relevant volume expansion in a so-called swelling mechanism that makes pores shrink. Under some specific conditions, the low temperature oxidation does not only trigger the formation of VO2 domains but also a drastic reduction of oxygen-deficient amorphous VOx in the films, which clearly improves the overall transparency and thermochromic modulation capabilities. The changes in the optical and electrical properties of these films during the metal-insulator transition have been studied, finding the best performance when the stoichiometry of the film before oxidation is [O]/[V]=1.5 and the oxidation temperature 280{\deg}C. These conditions yield a relatively transparent coating that presents an optical modulation in the near-infrared range of nearly 50% and a drop of electrical resistivity of more than two orders of magnitude. A tentative model based on the volume increase experienced by film upon oxidation is proposed to link the structural/chemical features of the films and the formation of VO2 domains at such relatively low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Printable Nanocomposites with Superparamagnetic Maghemite ($\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) Particles for Microinductor-core Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We here present printable and castable magnetic nanocomposites containing superparamagnetic 11$\pm$3 nm $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ particles in an insulating poly-vinyl alcohol polymer matrix. The nanocomposites feature well-dispersed particles with volume fractions between 10 and 45 \%, as confirmed by small-angle neutron scattering. The magnetic volume susceptibility is as high as 17, together with negligible hysteresis at low frequency, and constant AC-response up to the high-kHz range. Measured hysteresis curves at 100-900 kHz with up to 110 mT induced $B$-fields in the nanocomposite show that power losses depend on $B$-field squared, and frequency to the power of 1-1.3. The only loss mechanism in the nanocomposite is hysteresis losses at $&gt;$100 kHz frequencies, where the largest particles in the 11$\pm$3 nm distribution transition from the superparamagnetic to blocked regime. To mitigate the resulting hysteresis losses (up 10$^2$-10$^5$ kW/m$^3$) a more narrow particle size distribution could be used for future materials. The presented material is eddy current-free and easily integrated into micro-fabrication protocols, as we demonstrate by fabrication of 3-turn print circuit board based inductors with cast/manual printed nanocomposite inductor cores, on which induction has been measured up to 100 MHz.</description>

      <title>How to Incorporate Higher-order Interactions in Analog Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. Among such problems, Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is particularly relevant in industrial applications. To solve SAT problems using IMs, it is crucial to incorporate higher-order interactions. However, in analog IMs, interactions of different orders scale unevenly with the continuous spin amplitudes, introducing imbalances that can significantly degrade performance. We present a numerical comparison of methods to mitigate these imbalances, evaluating time-to-solution and success rate on Uniform Random 3-SAT instances from the SATLIB benchmark set. Our results show that the most effective approach employs spin interactions that are proportional to the signs of spins, rather than their continuous amplitudes. This generalizes our previous work, which showed that such interactions best mitigate imbalances induced by external fields in quadratic analog IMs. In this work, its advantage becomes substantially more pronounced, as it naturally mitigates imbalances across all interaction orders. We further demonstrate that smooth approximations of this method make it compatible with analog hardware. Our findings underscore the central role of spin-sign-based interactions in enabling robust and scalable analog IM dynamics.</description>

      <title>Implementing Pseudofractal Designs in Graphene-Based Quantum Hall Arrays using Minkowski-Bouligand Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a pseudofractal analysis for optimizing high-resistance graphene-based quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS). The development of resistance standard device designs through star-mesh transformations is detailed, aimed at minimizing element count. Building on a recent mathematical framework, the approach presented herein refines QHARS device concepts by considering designs incorporating pseudofractals (which may be expressed as star-mesh transformations). To understand how future QHARS pseudofractal designs enable varying sizes of neighborhoods of available quantized resistance, Minkowski-Bouligand algorithms are used to analyze fractal dimensions of the device design topologies. Three distinct partial recursion cases are explored in addition to the original full recursion design, and expressions for their total element counts are derived. These partial recursions, assessed through their fractal dimensions, offer enhanced flexibility in achieving specific resistance values within a desired neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, albeit with an increased number of required elements.

      <title>Influences of the Minkowski-Bouligand Dimension on Graphene-Based Quantum Hall Array Designs</title>

Abstract: This work elaborates on how one may develop high-resistance quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS) by using star-mesh transformations for element count minimization. Refinements are made on a recently developed mathematical framework optimizing QHARS device designs based on full, symmetric recursion by reconciling approximate device values with exact effective quantized resistances found by simulation and measurement. Furthermore, this work explores the concept of fractal dimension, clarifying the benefits of both full and partial recursions in QHARS devices. Three distinct partial recursion cases are visited for a near-1 Gigaohm QHARS device. These partial recursions, analyzed in the context of their fractal dimensions, offer increased flexibility in accessing desired resistance values within a specific neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, though at the cost of the number of required devices.</description>

      <title>A complex network perspective on brain disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If brain anatomy and dynamics have a genuine complex network structure as it has become standard to posit, it is also reasonable to assume that such a structure should play a key role not only in brain function but also in brain dysfunction. However, exactly how network structure is implicated in brain damage and whether at least some pathologies can be thought of as "network diseases" is not entirely clear. Here we discuss ways in which a complex network representation can help characterising brain pathology, but also subjects' vulnerability to and likelihood of recovery from disease. We show how the way disease is defined is related to the way function is defined and this, in turn, determines which network property may be functionally relevant to brain disease. Thus, addressing brain disease "networkness" may shed light not only on brain pathology, with potential clinical implications, but also on functional brain activity, and what is functional in it.</description>

      <title>Boosting Photodetection via Plasmonic Coupling in Quasi-2D Mixed-n Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskite Nanostripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-2D metal halide perovskites have emerged as a promising material for photodetection due to excellent optoelectronic properties, simple synthesis, and robust stability. Albeit, developing high-performance photodetectors based on low-dimensional quasi-2D metal halide perovskite nanoparticles remains challenging due to quantum and dielectric confinement effects. Several approaches have been employed to improve efficiency, with plasmonic nanostructures being among the most effective ones. The resonant energy transfer and coupling between plasmons and excitons play a vital role in enhancing device performance. Here, we demonstrate enhanced photodetection of quasi-2D perovskite nanostripes resulting from the incorporation of octadecanethiol (ODT) functionalized Ag nanostructure arrays (ANA). Using colloidal lithography, ANA were fabricated. Reflectance spectroscopy and finite element method (FEM) simulations show that ANA supports localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modes that spectrally coincide with the absorption and emission band of the perovskite. This spectral overlap enables interesting coupling interactions between the excitons and plasmons. The ODT-functionalized ANA photodetectors exhibit weak to intermediate coupling, resulting in a photocurrent enhancement factor of 838 %. They achieve photoresponsivities of up to 70.41 mA W^-1, detectivities of 1.48*10^11 Jones and external quantum efficiencies of 21.55 %, which are approximately 10 times higher than those of the reference photodetector. We present an approach to optimize the plasmon-exciton coupling and non-radiative energy transfer for developing high-performance plasmonic-perovskite hybrid photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Floquet Non-Bloch Formalism for a Non-Hermitian Ladder: From Theoretical Framework to Topolectrical Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological properties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust (despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to emergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit (TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the N\'eel temperature by ~10K. Our experimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.</description>

      <title>Overprinting with Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) is a light-based 3D printing technique capable of producing centimeter-scale objects within seconds. A key challenge lies in the calculation of projection patterns under non-standard conditions, such as the presence of occlusions and materials with diverse optical properties, including varying refractive indices or scattering surfaces. This work focuses on demonstrating a wide variety of overprinting scenarios. First, utilizing a telecentric laser-based TVAM (LaserTVAM), we demonstrate the printing of a microfluidic perfusion system with biocompatible resins on existing nozzles for potential biomedical applications. In a subsequent demonstration, embedded spheres within the bio-resins are localized inside this perfusion system, optimized into specific patterns, and successfully connected to the nozzles via printed channels in less than three minutes. As a final LaserTVAM example, we print gears on a glossy metal rod, taking into account the scattered rays from the rod's surface. Using a non-telecentric LED-based TVAM (LEDTVAM), we then overprint engravings onto an existing LED placed in the resin. With an additional printed lens on this LED, we can project those engravings onto a screen. In a similar application with the same setup, we print microlenses on a glass tube filled with water, allowing us to image samples embedded within the glass tubes. Based on a differentiable physically-based ray optical approach, we are able to optimize all these scenarios within our existing open-source framework called Dr.TVAM. This framework enables the optimization of high-quality projections for both LaserTVAM and LEDTVAM setups within minutes, as well as lower-quality projections within seconds, outperforming existing solutions in terms of speed, flexibility, and quality.</description>

      <title>NeOTF: Speckle-Constrained OTF Neural Representation for Non-invasive Imaging through Scattering Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging through scattering media via speckle correlation is fundamentally challenged by ill-posed reconstruction. To overcome this, we bypass direct object recovery and instead target the system's deterministic optical transfer function (OTF). We introduce NeOTF, a framework that learns an implicit neural representation of the OTF. By optimizing this representation using multi-frame speckle intensities and a physical Fourier-domain prior, NeOTF robustly retrieves the system's OTF. Subsequent deconvolution with this retrieved OTF yields high-fidelity object reconstructions. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate that NeOTF achieves superior accuracy and efficiency over conventional methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time scattering imaging.</description>
