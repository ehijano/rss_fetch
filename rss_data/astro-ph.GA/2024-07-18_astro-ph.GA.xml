      <title>Resolving the nano-Hz gravitational wave sky: the detectability of eccentric binaries with PTA experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations reported evidence of a nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave background (sGWB) compatible with an adiabatically inspiraling population of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). Despite the large uncertainties, the relatively flat spectral slope of the recovered signal suggests a possible prominent role of MBHB dynamical coupling with the environment or/and the presence of an eccentric MBHB population. This work aims at studying the capabilities of future PTA experiments to detect single MBHBs under the realistic assumption that the sGWB is originated from an eccentric binary population coupled with its environment. To this end, we generalize the standard signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Fisher Information Matrix calculations used in PTA for circular MBHBs to the case of eccentric systems. We consider an ideal 10-year MeerKAT and 30-year SKA PTAs and apply our method over a wide number of simulated eccentric MBHB populations. We find that the number of resolvable MBHBs for the SKA (MeerKAT) PTA is ${\sim}\,30$ ($4$) at $\rm SNR\,{&gt;}\,5$ (${&gt;}\,3$), featuring an increasing trend for larger eccentricity values of the MBHB population. This is the result of eccentric MBHBs at ${\lesssim}\,10^{-9}\, \rm Hz$ emitting part of their power at high harmonics, thus reaching the PTA sensitivity band. Our results also indicate that resolved MBHBs do not follow the eccentricity distribution of the underlying MBHB population, but prefer low eccentricity values (${&lt;}\,0.6$). Finally, the recovery of binary intrinsic properties and sky-localization do not depend on the system eccentricity, while orbital parameters such as eccentricity and initial orbital phase show clear trends. Although simplified, our results show that SKA will enable the detection of tens of MBHBs, projecting us into the era of precision gravitational wave astronomy at nano-Hz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Impact of star formation models on the growth of galaxies at high redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the impact of star formation models on galaxy evolution, we perform cosmological zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of a dwarf dark matter halo with virial mass 1e9 Msun at z=6. Two different star formation models are compared, a model based on a local gravo-thermo-turbulent condition and a model based on a sink particle algorithm. Using idealized tests of collapsing isothermal spheres and giant molecular clouds with different turbulent structures, we determine the optimal accretion radius to be twice the cell size and the resolution required to achieve reasonable convergence in star formation efficiency to 0.3 pc for the sink algorithm. As a first study in this series, we use cosmological zoom-in simulations with different spatial resolutions and find that star formation is more bursty in the runs with the sink algorithm, generating stronger outflows than in the runs with the gravo-thermo-turbulent model. The main reason for the increased burstiness is that the gas accretion rates on the sinks are high enough to form stars on very short timescales, leading to more clustered star formation. As a result, the star-forming clumps are disrupted more quickly in the sink run due to more coherent radiation and supernova feedback. The difference in burstiness between the two star formation models becomes even more pronounced when the supernova explosion energy is artificially increased. Our results suggest that improving the modelling of star formation on small, sub-molecular cloud scales can significantly impact the global properties of simulated galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way's rowdy neighbours: The effects of the Large Magellanic Cloud and Sagittarius Dwarf on the Milky Way Disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) is a barred spiral galaxy shaped by tidal interactions with its satellites. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy (Sgr) are the dominant influences at the present day. This paper presents a suite of four 10^9 particle N-body simulations, illustrating the response of the MW's stellar disc to the close approach of the LMC and the merger of Sgr into the MW. The suite is intended to provide a resource for others to study the complex interactions between the MW and its satellites independently and combined, in comparison to an isolated disc control simulation. Such high resolution simulations are vital to understand the kinematics and morphology of the MW taking into account the effects of each satellite. In our preliminary analysis, we find that the influences from the LMC and Sgr on the MW's disc appear distinct, additive and separable within our tailored simulations. Notably, the corrugations induced by Sgr reproduce the large radial velocity wave seen in the data Eilers+20. Overall, our findings emphasise the need to include both satellites when modelling the present-day state of the MW structure and kinematics.</description>

      <title>Observable and ionizing properties of star-forming galaxies with very massive stars and different IMFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of very massive stars (VMS, masses $&gt;100$ M$_{\odot}$) is now firmly established in the local group, nearby galaxies, and out to cosmological distances. If present, these stars could boost the UV luminosity and ionizing photon production of galaxies, helping thus to alleviate the overabundance of UV-bright galaxies found with the JWST at high-redshift. Combing consistent stellar evolution and atmosphere models tailored to VMS we compute spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a large set of models. We find that VMS contribute significantly to the UV luminosity and Lyman continuum of young stellar populations, and they are characterized by strong stellar HeII1640 emission, with EW(HeII) up to 4-8 Ang at young ages or $\sim 2.5-4$ Ang for constant SFR. For IMFs with a Salpeter slope, the boost of the UV luminosity is relatively modest. However, small changes in the IMF slope (e.g.~from $\alpha_2=-2.35$ to $-2$) lead to large increases in $L_{UV}$ and the ionizing photon production $Q$. Emission line strengths and the ionizing photon efficiency $\xi_{\rm ion}$ are also increased with VMS. Interestingly, SEDs including VMS show smaller Lyman breaks, and the shape of the ionizing spectra remain unaltered up to $\sim 35$ eV, but becomes softer at higher energies. We derive and discuss the maximum values quantities such as $L_{UV}$ per stellar mass or unit SFR, and $\xi_{\rm ion}$, $Q$ can reach when VMS are included, and we show that these values become essentially independent of the IMF. We propose observational methods to test for VMS and constrain the IMF. Finally, using JWST observations, we examine if high-redshift galaxies show some evidence of the presence of VMS and signs of non-standard IMFs. Very top-heavy IMFs can be excluded on average, but the IMF could well extend into the regime of VMS and be flatter than Salpeter in the bulk of high-$z$ galaxies. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Revisiting AGN Placement on the BPT Diagram: A Spectral Decomposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional single-fibre spectroscopy provides a single galaxy spectrum, forming the basis for crucial parameter estimation. However, its accuracy can be compromised by various sources of contamination, such as the prominent \Ha~emission line originating from both Star-Forming (SF) regions and non-Star-Forming regions (NonSF), including Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The potential to dissect a spectrum into its SF and NonSF constituents holds the promise of significantly enhancing precision in parameter estimates. In contrast, Integral Field Unit (IFU) surveys present a solution to minimize contamination. These surveys examine spatially localized regions within galaxies, reducing the impact of mixed sources. Although an IFU survey's resulting spectrum covers a smaller region of a galaxy than single-fibre spectroscopy, it can still encompass a blend of heterogeneous sources. Our study introduces an innovative model informed by insights from the MaNGA IFU survey. This model enables the decomposition of galaxy spectra, including those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), into SF and NonSF components. Applying our model to these survey datasets produces two distinct spectra, one for SF and another for NonSF components, while conserving flux across wavelength bins. When these decomposed spectra are visualized on a BPT diagram, interesting patterns emerge. There is a significant shift in the placement of the NonSF decomposed spectra, as well as the emergence of two distinct clusters in the LINER and Seyfert regions. This shift highlights the key role of SF `contamination' in influencing the positioning of NonSF spectra within the BPT diagram.</description>

      <title>Gas-Phase metallicity for the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7130</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallicity measurements in galaxies can give valuable clues about galaxy evolution. One of the mechanisms postulated for metallicity redistribution in galaxies is gas flows induced by AGN, but the details of this process remain elusive. We report the discovery of a positive radial gradient in the gas-phase metallicity of the narrow line region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7130, which is not found when considering the star-forming components in the galaxy disk. To determine gas-phase metallicities for each kinematic component, we use both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming (SF) strong-line abundance relations, as well as BPT diagnostic diagrams. These relations involve sensitive strong emission lines, namely [OIII]5007, [NII]6584, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [SII]6716, and [SII]6731, observed with the adaptive-optics-assisted mode of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The presence of a positive radial metallicity gradient only in the AGN ionized component suggests that metals may be transported from central areas to its purlieus by AGN activity.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Extinction Curve Revealed by Gaia XP Spectra and LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a direct measurement of extinction curves using corrected $Gaia$ XP spectra of the common sources in $Gaia$ DR3 and LAMOST DR7. Our analysis of approximately 370 thousand high-quality samples yielded a high-precision average extinction curve for the Milky Way. After incorporating infrared photometric data from 2MASS and WISE, the extinction curve spans wavelengths from 0.336 to 4.6 $\mu$m. We determine an average $R_{55}$ of $2.730 \pm 0.007$, corresponding to $R_V= 3.073 \pm 0.009$, and a near-infrared power-law index $\alpha$ of $1.935 \pm 0.037$. Our study confirmed some intermediate-scale structures within the optical range. Two new features were identified at 540 and 769 nm, and their intensities exhibited a correlation with extinction and $R_V$. This extinction curve can be used to investigate the characteristics of dust and enhance the extinction correction of Milky Way stars. A Python package for this extinction curve is available.</description>

      <title>Exploring Milky Way rotation curves with Gaia DR3: a comparison between $\Lambda$CDM, MOND, and General Relativistic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the release of Gaia DR3, we extend the comparison between dynamical models for the Milky Way rotation curve initiated in the previous work. Utilising astrometric and spectro-photometric data for 719143 young disc stars within $|z|&lt;1$ kpc and up to $R \simeq 19$ kpc, we investigate the accuracy of MOND and $\Lambda$CDM frameworks in addition to previously studied models, such as the classical one with a Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo and a general relativistic model. We find that all models, including MOND and $\Lambda$CDM, are statistically equivalent in representing the observed rotational velocities. However, $\Lambda$CDM, characterized by an Einasto density profile and cosmological constraints on its parameters, assigns more dark matter than the model featuring a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, with the virial mass estimated at $1.5\text{-}2.5 \times 10^{12} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ - a value significantly higher than recent literature estimates. Beyond $10\text{-}15$ kpc, non-Newtonian/non-baryonic contributions to the rotation curve are found to become dominant for all models consistently. Our results suggest the need for further exploration into the role of General Relativity, dark matter, and alternative theories of gravitational dynamics in shaping Milky Way's rotation curve.</description>

      <title>Milky Way: New Galactic mass model for orbit computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate observational data on the rotation curve of the Milky Way galaxy (MW) are very well understood using the gravitational potentials of the baryonic matter (Pouliasis et al., 2017) and the interpolating function presented by McGaugh et al. (2016). In this way we couple the spherically symmetric mass distribution of the dark matter (DM) to the mass distribution of the baryonic matter (BM). A commonly used model of the dark matter distribution can be understood as an approximation of our model. Creation of a new Galactic mass model for orbit computations based on the coupling of the DM with an improved BM model respecting the theoretical fit of the Galactic rotation curve. The theoretical approach is based on a slight improvement of the BM model by Pouliasis et al. (2017) and on replacement of their DM model by the model based on the interpolating function by McGaugh et al. (2016). The theoretical results are validated by the comparison with observational data. New Galactic mass model for orbit computations is created. DM distribution is given and the rotation curve for the MW is consistent with observational data. The Tully-Fisher relation holds and the values of several characteristics of the MW for the region of the Sun are given, e.g., rotation speed $v_0$ = ($228.8 \pm 0.2$) ~ \mbox{km} \mbox{s}$^{-1}$, Oort constants $A=(+14.73 \pm 0.03) ~\mbox{km} ~\mbox{s}^{-1} ~\mbox{kpc}^{-1} $, $B=(-13.01 \pm 0.03) ~\mbox{km} ~\mbox{s}^{-1} ~\mbox{kpc}^{-1}$ and the mass density of the baryonic matter $(0.087 \pm 0.001) ~\mbox{M}_{\odot} ~\mbox{pc}^{-3} $. Important MW characteristics are the total BM mass $M_{BM}$ $=$ (8.43 $\pm$ 0.01) $\times$ 10$^{10}$ $\mbox{M}_{\odot}$, the total DM mass $M_{DM}$ $\doteq$ (1.34 $\pm$ 0.01) $\times$ 10$^{12}$ $\mbox{M}_{\odot}$, virial radius and virial mass of the MW, $M_{vir}$ $\doteq$ $M_{DM}$.</description>

      <title>A global view on star formation: The GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey. XI. Radio source catalog IV: $2^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 28^\circ$, $36^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 60^\circ$ and $|b| &lt; 1^\circ$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GLOSTAR survey studies star formation with the VLA and the Effelsberg 100m telescope in the Galactic plane (-2d&lt;l&lt;60d; |b|&lt;1d) and the Cygnus X region with unprecedented sensitivity in both flux density (~50uJy/beam) and the capability of detecting emission with angular scales in the range from 1" to the largest radio structures in the Galaxy.
  We provide a complete GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration radio source catalog for the covered part of the Galactic disk. A catalog for the pilot region (28d&lt;l&lt;36d) has been published in a previous paper and here we present the complementary catalog for the area within 2d&lt;l&lt;28d, 36d&lt;l&lt;60d and |b|&lt;1d.
  Observations were taken with the VLA in a 4-8GHz band to image 100 degrees$^2$ of the inner Galactic disk at a reference frequency of 5.8GHz, using 260h of telescope time. We determined spectral indices inside the observed band and in the frequency range 1.4-5.8GHz by complementing our results with those from the THOR survey (1-2GHz).
  The final images have an angular resolution of 18" and an average sensitivity of 123uJy/beam. The sensitivity is better (~60uJy/beam) in areas free of extended emission. The Galactic disk catalog presented in this work, consists of 11211 radio sources. Of these, 1965 are known large-scale structure sources such as star-forming region complexes, well-known SNRs, SNR candidates or parts thereof. The remaining 9227 are discrete individual sources. Source parameters, namely flux densities, sizes, spectral indices, and classifications are reported. We identify 769 HII region candidates, 359 are newly classified as such. The mean value of spectral indices of 225 HII regions is 0.14$\pm$0.02, consistent with most of them emitting optically thin thermal radio emission. Combining our results with the previously published catalog of the pilot region, the final GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration catalog contains 12981 radio sources.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on the stellar Mass-Metallicity Relation of quiescent galaxies from the LEGA-C survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar Mass-Metallicity Relation (MZR) using a sample of 637 quiescent galaxies with 10.4 &lt;= log(M*/M ) &lt; 11.7 selected from the LEGA-C survey at 0.6 &lt;= z &lt;= 1. We derive mass-weighted stellar metallicities using full-spectral fitting. We find that while lower-mass galaxies are both metal -rich and -poor, there are no metal-poor galaxies at high masses, and that metallicity is bounded at low values by a mass-dependent lower limit. This lower limit increases with mass, empirically defining a MEtallicity-Mass Exclusion (MEME) zone. We find that the spectral index MgFe = \sqrt{Mgb \times Fe4383}, a proxy for the stellar metallicity, also shows a mass-dependent lower limit resembling the MEME relation. Crucially, MgFe is independent of stellar population models and fitting methods. By constructing the Metallicity Enrichment Histories, we find that, after the first Gyr, the Star Formation History of galaxies has a mild impact on the observed metallicity distribution. Finally, from the average formation times, we find that galaxies populate differently the metallicity-mass plane at different cosmic times, and that the MEME limit is recovered by galaxies that formed at z &gt;= 3. Our work suggests that the stellar metallicity of quiescent galaxies is bounded by a lower limit which increases with the stellar mass. On the other hand, low-mass galaxies can have metallicities as high as galaxies ~1 dex more massive. This suggests that, at log(M*/M ) &gt;= 10.4, rather than lower-mass galaxies being systematically less metallic, the observed MZR might be a consequence of the lack of massive, metal-poor galaxies.</description>

      <title>How does dark matter stabilize disc galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study presents a theoretical framework for understanding the role of dark matter on the stability of the galactic disc. We model the galaxy as a two-component system consisting of stars and gas in equilibrium with an external dark matter halo. We derive the equations governing the growth of perturbations and obtain a stability criterion that connects the potential of the dark matter halo and the gas fraction with the stability levels of the galaxy. We find that a two-component disc is more susceptible to the growth of gravitational instabilities than individual components, particularly as gas fractions increase. However, the external field, due to the dark matter halo, acts as a stabilizing agent and increases the net stability levels even in the presence of a cold gas component. We apply the stability criterion to models of the Milky Way, low surface brightness galaxies, and baryon-dominated cold rotating disc galaxies observed in the early universe. Our results show that the potential due to the dark matter halo plays a significant role in stabilizing nearby galaxies, such as the Milky Way, and low surface brightness galaxies, which would otherwise be prone to local gravitational instabilities. However, we find that the baryon-dominated cold disc galaxies observed in the early universe remain susceptible to the growth of local gravitational instabilities despite the stabilizing effect of the dark matter halo.</description>

Abstract: Using the data of eROSITA (extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) taken during the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1), we perform the first X-ray classification and population study in the field of Canis Major overdensity (CMa OD), which is a candidate for the remnant of a dwarf galaxy that is merging to the Milky Way disk. The study aims to identify the X-ray sources in CMa OD. For this purpose, we developed a classification algorithm using multi-wavelength criteria as a preliminary method for the classification of faint X-ray sources, specifically in regions with a high source number density. Out of a total number of 8311 X-ray sources, we have classified 1029 sources as Galactic stars and binaries in the foreground, 946 sources as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies in the background, and 435 sources with stellar counterparts, which can belong to either the MW or CMa OD. Among the sources with a stellar counterpart, we have identified 34 symbiotic star candidates, plus 335 sources, of which the infrared counterparts have properties of M-giants in CMa OD. Moreover, there is a known high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB, 4U 0728-25) in the field of our study, which, according to the Gaia parallax of its companion, seems to be a member of CMa OD. There is also a recently detected transient low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB, SRGt J071522.1-191609), which can be a member of CMa OD based on its companion that is most likely highly absorbed and is thus located behind the Galactic disk. In addition, we present the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of members and candidate members of CMa OD. It is dominated by sources with luminosities of &lt; 2*10^32-10^33 erg/s in the energy range of 0.2-2.3 keV, which are expected to be either accreting white dwarfs or quiescent LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Bursting with Feedback: The Relationship between Feedback Model and Bursty Star Formation Histories in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use high-resolution cosmological simulations to compare the effect of bursty star formation histories on dwarf galaxy structure for two different subgrid supernovae (SNe) feedback models in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses from $5000 &lt;$ M$_*$/M$_\odot$ $&lt; 10^{9}$. Our simulations are run using two distinct supernova feedback models: superbubble and blastwave. We show that both models are capable of producing galaxies that are cored and reproduce observed scaling relations for metallicity, luminosity, mass, and size. We show that continuous bursty star formation and the resulting stellar feedback are able to sustain dark matter cores in the higher dwarf galaxy mass regime, while the majority of ultra-faint and classical dwarfs retain cuspy central dark matter density profiles. We find that both subgrid SN models are able to create bursty star formation histories. We find that effective core formation peaks at M$_*$/M$_\odot$ $\simeq 5 \times 10^{-3}$ for both feedback models. Galaxies simulated with superbubble feedback peak at lower mean burstiness values relative to blastwave feedback, indicating that core formation in the superbubble sample may be less motivated by the burstiness of star formation.</description>

      <title>Galactic Chemical Evolution Models Favor an Extended Type Ia Supernova Delay-Time Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation, and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in multi-zone chemical evolution models which include radial stellar migration. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that the DTD has the largest effect on the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed high-$\alpha$ sequence. Our model results favor an extended DTD with fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial $t^{-1}$ power law.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling relation incorporating the cusp-to-core transition of dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark matter haloes associated with galaxies have hitherto established strong correlations within a range of observed parameters, known as scaling relations of dark matter haloes. The origin of these scaling relations still contains significant ambiguities and requires comprehensive exploration for complete understanding. Utilising the correlation between the concentration and mass of dark matter haloes inferred from cosmological $N$-body simulations based on the cold dark matter paradigm ($c$-$M$ relation), we derive theoretical scaling relations among other physical quantities such as the surface mass density, the maximum circular velocity, and the scale radius of the dark matter halo. By comparing theoretical and observed scaling relations at various mass scales, it is found that the scaling relations observed in dwarf galaxies and galaxies originate in the $c$-$M$ relation of the dark matter halo. We predict that this theoretical scaling relation is also established in galaxy clusters. Moreover, we propose a novel theoretical scaling relation that incorporates the effects of the cusp-to-core transition, which is supposed to occur in cold dark matter haloes. Our discussion concludes with the exploration of potential observational verification of the cusp-to-core transition process in dark matter haloes.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-CRISTAL survey: Dust temperature and physical conditions of the interstellar medium in a typical galaxy at z=5.66</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new $\lambda_{\rm rest}=77$ $\mu$m dust continuum observations from the ALMA of HZ10 (CRISTAL-22), a dusty main-sequence galaxy at $z$=5.66 as part of the [CII] Resolved Ism in STar-forming Alma Large program, CRISTAL. The high angular resolution of the ALMA Band 7 and new Band 9 data($\sim{0}''.4$) reveals the complex structure of HZ10, which comprises two main components (HZ10-C and HZ10-W) and a bridge-like dusty emission between them (the Bridge). We model the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) to constrain the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) and its variations among the different components identified in HZ10. We find that HZ10-W (the more UV-obscured component) has an SED dust temperature of $T_{\rm SED}$$\sim$51.2$\pm13.1$ K; this is $\sim$5 K higher (although still consistent) than that of the central component and previous global estimations for HZ10. Our new ALMA data allow us to reduce by a factor of $\sim$2.3 the uncertainties of global $T_{\rm SED}$ measurements compared to previous studies. Interestingly, HZ10-W shows a lower [CII]/FIR ratio compared to the other two components (although still within the uncertainties), suggesting a harder radiation field destroying polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon associated with [CII] emission (e.g., active galactic nuclei or young stellar populations). While HZ10-C appears to follow the tight IRX-$\beta_{\rm UV}$ relation seen in local UV-selected starburst galaxies and high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, we find that both HZ10-W and the Bridge depart from this relation and are well described by dust-screen models with holes in front of a hard UV radiation field. This suggests that the UV emission (likely from young stellar populations) is strongly attenuated in the more dusty components of the HZ10 system.</description>

      <title>The Population II Extragalactic Distance Scale: A TRGB Distance to the Fornax Cluster with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differences between the local value of the Hubble constant measured via the distance ladder versus the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background with the assumption of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model have reached over 5$\sigma$ significance. To determine if this discrepancy is due to new physics or more mundane systematic errors, it is essential to remove as many sources of systematic uncertainty as possible by developing high-precision distance ladders that are independent of the traditional Cepheid and Type Ia supernovae route. Here we present JWST observations of three early-type Fornax Cluster galaxies, the first of fourteen observations from a Cycle 2 JWST program. Our modest integration times allow us to measure highly precise tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances, and will also be used to perform measurements of Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF). From these three galaxies, we determine an average TRGB distance modulus to the Fornax Cluster of $\mu$ = 31.424 $\pm$ 0.077 mag, or D = 19.3 $\pm$ 0.7 Mpc. With eleven more scheduled observations in nearby elliptical galaxies, our program will allow us set the zero point of the SBF scale to better than 2$\%$ for more distant measurements, charting a path towards a high-precision measurement of $H_{0}$ that is independent of the traditional Cepheid-SN Ia distance ladder.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Black Hole Mass at Solar Metallicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the current knowledge and uncertainties in detailed stellar evolution and wind modelling to evaluate the mass of the most massive stellar black hole (BH) at solar metallicity. Contrary to common expectations that it is the most massive stars that produce the most massive BHs, we find that the maximum $M_{\rm BH}^{\rm Max} \simeq 30 \pm 10\,M_{\odot}$ is found in the canonical intermediate range between $M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 30$ and $50\,M_{\odot}$ instead. The prime reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive finding is that very massive stars (VMS) have increasingly high mass-loss rates, leading to substantial mass evaporation before they expire as stars, ending as lighter BHs than their canonical O-star counterparts.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study to decipher the 2017 flare of the blazar OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In February 2017, the blazar OJ~287 underwent a period of intense multiwavelength activity. It reached a new historic peak in the soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) band, as measured by Swift-XRT. This event coincides with a very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray outburst that led VERITAS to detect emission above 100 GeV, with a detection significance of $10\sigma$ (from 2016 December 9 to 2017 March 31). The time-averaged VHE $\gamma$-ray spectrum was consistent with a soft power law ($\Gamma = -3.81 \pm 0.26$) and an integral flux corresponding to $\sim2.4\%$ that of the Crab Nebula above the same energy. Contemporaneous data from multiple instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal complex flaring behavior, primarily in the soft X-ray and VHE bands. To investigate the possible origin of such an event, our study focuses on three distinct activity states: before, during, and after the February 2017 peak. The spectral energy distributions during these periods suggest the presence of at least two non-thermal emission zones, with the more compact one responsible for the observed flare. Broadband modeling results and observations of a new radio knot in the jet of OJ~287 in 2017 are consistent with a flare originating from a strong recollimation shock outside the radio core.</description>
