      <title>Thermal Acoustical and Mechanical Characterization of Rock under in-situ conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data on the coupled influence of pressure and temperature on rock thermal conductivity remain limited. This study adapts a multi-anvil cubic press to enable steady-state thermal conductivity measurements under controlled in-situ conditions. The setup concurrently records P- and S-wave velocities along three orthogonal directions, providing unique real-time constraints on micro-structural evolution. Beyond the expected temperature dependence, preliminary tests on two sandstones reveal a twofold pressure effect: increasing confining pressure enhances thermal conductivity through microcrack closure and better grain contacts, while simultaneously reducing the rate at which conductivity decreases with temperature. Initial results align closely with published datasets, supporting the reliability of the developed methodology. Quantitatively, the thermal conductivity of the studied sandstones was found to decrease by an average of approximately 5.9% per 50 {\deg}C at the lowest confinement (12 MPa), compared with about 4.2% per 50 {\deg}C at the highest confinement (100 MPa). In addition, an average increase of roughly 1.4% per 10 MPa of applied confining pressure was observed for both samples.</description>

      <title>Water saturation in texturally porous carbonate rocks: Shock thermodynamics and dampening of the shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sedimentary rocks often form the upper layers or the entire target rocks in impact events. Thermodynamic properties of sedimentary rocks related to porosity and water saturation affect the process of impact crater formation. The heterogeneous distribution of sedimentary facies can complicate the development and distribution of shock effects, especially in numerical modeling. This work focuses on the shock thermodynamic properties of carbonate rocks with differing porosity textures (e.g., isolated pores, interstitial porosity, elongated pores) and water saturation levels. Using mesoscale numerical modeling, we found that water saturation reduces shock temperatures compared to those in dry, porous carbonate rocks. The orientation of elongated pores and porosity lineations influences the shock temperature distribution and rock deformation at angles of 50-90{\deg} to the shock front. Additionally, due to complex shock wave interactions, interstitial porosity is key in creating temperature zonations around larger grains.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for microseismic event detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks like PhaseNet show high accuracy in detecting microseismic events, but their black-box nature is a concern in critical applications. We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors. On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of 0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet (F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated seismic detectors.</description>

      <title>Towards geological inference with process-based and deep generative modeling, part 2: inversion of fluvial deposits and latent-space disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data, especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best leverage them in support of geological interpretation.</description>
