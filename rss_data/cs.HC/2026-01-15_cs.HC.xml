      <title>Leveraging learning analytics to enhance immersive teacher simulations: Challenges and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter examines how data analytics can be leveraged to enhance immersive teacher simulations, situating this inquiry within the broader learning sciences discourse on embodied cognition, data-informed feedback, and teacher professional learning. It explores both conceptual foundations and empirical cases to illustrate how analytics serve as mediational tools that connect immersive experiences with reflective teaching practice. The chapter unfolds in multiple sections: (1) The Innovation Journey: An Overview of Immersive Teacher Simulations outlines the evolution from traditional simulations to XR-based environments, highlighting the need for professional decision-making under realistic constraints. (2) Innovation in Existing Research and Practice situates teacher analytics within the trajectory from descriptive observation to multimodal and predictive modeling. (3) Study Approach and Design details how multimodal data-discourse, behavior, and gaze-from the TeacherGen@i simulation were collected and organized to reveal cognitive distribution of pedagogical discourse and interaction patterns. (4) Findings present the cognitive distribution of preservice teachers' pedagogical discourse and the sequential interaction patterns that emerge in exchange, illustrating how multimodal analytics make pedagogical reasoning processes visible within immersive simulations. (5) Understanding Innovative Practices in Teacher Education examines teaching analytics to enhance immersive teacher simulation based on the findings of the study. (6) Key Takeaways of the Innovation Journey identifies research challenges and design implications for scalable, analytics-enhanced teacher education. Together, these sections position immersive teacher simulations as a pivotal testbed for aligning learning analytics, professional learning, and next-generation immersive learning environment design.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effects of Generative AI Assistance on Writing Self-Efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is increasingly used in academic writing, yet its effects on students' writing self-efficacy remain contingent on how assistance is configured. This pilot study investigates how ideation-level, sentence-level, full-process, and no AI support differentially shape undergraduate writers' self-efficacy using a 2 by 2 experimental design with Korean undergraduates completing argumentative writing tasks. Results indicate that AI assistance does not uniformly enhance self-efficacy full AI support produced high but stable self-efficacy alongside signs of reduced ownership, sentence-level AI support led to consistent self-efficacy decline, and ideation-level AI support was associated with both high self-efficacy and positive longitudinal change. These findings suggest that the locus of AI intervention, rather than the amount of assistance, is critical in fostering writing self-efficacy while preserving learner agency.</description>

      <title>Exploring Organizational Readiness and Ecosystem Coordination for Industrial XR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) offers transformative potential for industrial support, training, and maintenance; yet, widespread adoption lags despite demonstrated occupational value and hardware maturity. Organizations successfully implement XR in isolated pilots, yet struggle to scale these into sustained operational deployment, a phenomenon we characterize as the ``Pilot Trap.'' This study examines this phenomenon through a qualitative ecosystem analysis of 17 expert interviews across technology providers, solution integrators, and industrial adopters. We identify a ``Great Inversion'' in adoption barriers: critical constraints have shifted from technological maturity to organizational readiness (e.g., change management, key performance indicator alignment, and political resistance). While hardware ergonomics and usability remain relevant, our findings indicate that systemic misalignments between stakeholder incentives are the primary cause of friction preventing enterprise integration. We conclude that successful industrial XR adoption requires a shift from technology-centric piloting to a problem-first, organizational transformation approach, necessitating explicit ecosystem-level coordination.</description>

      <title>Immersive XR That Moves People: How XR Advertising Transforms Comprehension, Empathy, and Behavioural Intention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) affords an enhanced sense of bodily presence that supports experiential modes of comprehension and affective engagement which exceed the possibilities of conventional information delivery. Nevertheless, the psychological processes engendered by XR, and the manner in which these processes inform subsequent behavioural intentions, remain only partially delineated. The present study addresses this issue within an applied context by comparing non-immersive 2D viewing advertising with immersive XR experiential advertising. We examined whether XR strengthens internal responses to a product, specifically perceived comprehension and empathy, and whether these responses, in turn, influence the behavioural outcome of purchase intention. A repeated-measures two-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant main effect of advertising modality, with XR yielding higher ratings on all evaluative dimensions. Mediation analysis further indicated that the elevation in purchase intention was mediated by empathy, whereas no significant mediating effect was observed for comprehension within the scope of this study. These findings suggest that immersive XR experiences augment empathic engagement with virtual products, and that this enhanced empathy plays a pivotal role in shaping subsequent behavioural intentions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating local large language models for structured extraction from endometriosis-specific transvaginal ultrasound reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we evaluate a locally-deployed large-language model (LLM) to convert unstructured endometriosis transvaginal ultrasound (eTVUS) scan reports into structured data for imaging informatics workflows. Across 49 eTVUS reports, we compared three LLMs (7B/8B and a 20B-parameter model) against expert human extraction. The 20B model achieved a mean accuracy of 86.02%, substantially outperforming smaller models and confirming the importance of scale in handling complex clinical text. Crucially, we identified a highly complementary error profile: the LLM excelled at syntactic consistency (e.g., date/numeric formatting) where humans faltered, while human experts provided superior semantic and contextual interpretation. We also found that the LLM's semantic errors were fundamental limitations that could not be mitigated by simple prompt engineering. These findings strongly support a human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow in which the on-premise LLM serves as a collaborative tool, not a full replacement. It automates routine structuring and flags potential human errors, enabling imaging specialists to focus on high-level semantic validation. We discuss implications for structured reporting and interactive AI systems in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>World Craft: Agentic Framework to Create Visualizable Worlds via Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate generative agent simulation (e.g., AI Town) to create a ``dynamic world'', holding immense value across entertainment and research. However, for non-experts, especially those without programming skills, it isn't easy to customize a visualizable environment by themselves. In this paper, we introduce World Craft, an agentic world creation framework to create an executable and visualizable AI Town via user textual descriptions. It consists of two main modules, World Scaffold and World Guild. World Scaffold is a structured and concise standardization to develop interactive game scenes, serving as an efficient scaffolding for LLMs to customize an executable AI Town-like environment. World Guild is a multi-agent framework to progressively analyze users' intents from rough descriptions, and synthesizes required structured contents (\eg environment layout and assets) for World Scaffold . Moreover, we construct a high-quality error-correction dataset via reverse engineering to enhance spatial knowledge and improve the stability and controllability of layout generation, while reporting multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing commercial code agents (Cursor and Antigravity) and LLMs (Qwen3 and Gemini-3-Pro). in scene construction and narrative intent conveyance, providing a scalable solution for the democratization of environment creation.</description>

      <title>Mikasa: A Character-Driven Emotional AI Companion Inspired by Japanese Oshi Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models and multimodal interaction has made it possible to develop AI companions that can have fluent and emotionally expressive conversations. However, many of these systems have problems keeping users satisfied and engaged over long periods. This paper argues that these problems do not come mainly from weak models, but from poor character design and unclear definitions of the user-AI relationship. I present Mikasa, an emotional AI companion inspired by Japanese Oshi culture-specifically its emphasis on long-term, non-exclusive commitment to a stable character-as a case study of character-driven companion design. Mikasa does not work as a general-purpose assistant or a chatbot that changes roles. Instead, Mikasa is designed as a coherent character with a stable personality and a clearly defined relationship as a partner. This relationship does not force exclusivity or obligation. Rather, it works as a reference point that stabilizes interaction norms and reduces the work users must do to keep redefining the relationship. Through an exploratory evaluation, I see that users describe their preferences using surface-level qualities such as conversational naturalness, but they also value relationship control and imaginative engagement in ways they do not state directly. These results suggest that character coherence and relationship definition work as latent structural elements that shape how good the interaction feels, without users recognizing them as main features. The contribution of this work is to show that character design is a functional part of AI companion systems, not just decoration. Mikasa is one example based on a specific cultural context, but the design principles-commitment to a consistent personality and clear relationship definition-can be used for many emotionally grounded AI companions.</description>

      <title>Technological Advances in Two Generations of Consumer-Grade VR Systems: Effects on User Experience and Task Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated VR (IVR) systems consist of a head-mounted display (HMD) and body-tracking capabilities. They enable users to translate their physical movements into corresponding avatar movements in real-time, allowing them to perceive their avatars via the displays. Consumer-grade IVR systems have been available for 10 years, significantly fostering VR research worldwide. However, the effects of even apparently significant technological advances of IVR systems on user experience and the overall validity of prior embodiment research using such systems often remain unclear. We ran a user-centered study comparing two comparable IVR generations: a nearly 10-year-old hardware (HTC Vive, 6-point tracking) and a modern counterpart (HTC Vive Pro 2, 6-point tracking). To ensure ecological validity, we evaluated the systems in their commercially available, as-is configurations. In a 2x5 mixed design, participants completed five tasks covering different use cases on either the old or new system. We assessed presence, sense of embodiment, appearance and behavior plausibility, workload, task performance, and gathered qualitative feedback. Results showed no significant system differences, with only small effect sizes. Bayesian analysis further supported the null hypothesis, suggesting that the investigated generational hardware improvements offer limited benefits for user experience and task performance. For the 10-year generational step examined here, excluding potential technological progress in the necessary software components, this supports the validity of conclusions from prior work and underscores the applicability of older configurations for research in embodied VR.</description>

      <title>Full Disclosure, Less Trust? How the Level of Detail about AI Use in News Writing Affects Readers' Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into news production, calls for transparency about the use of AI have gained considerable traction. Recent studies suggest that AI disclosures can lead to a ``transparency dilemma'', where disclosure reduces readers' trust. However, little is known about how the \textit{level of detail} in AI disclosures influences trust and contributes to this dilemma within the news context. In this 3$\times$2$\times$2 mixed factorial study with 40 participants, we investigate how three levels of AI disclosures (none, one-line, detailed) across two types of news (politics and lifestyle) and two levels of AI involvement (low and high) affect news readers' trust. We measured trust using the News Media Trust questionnaire, along with two decision behaviors: source-checking and subscription decisions. Questionnaire responses and subscription rates showed a decline in trust only for detailed AI disclosures, whereas source-checking behavior increased for both one-line and detailed disclosures, with the effect being more pronounced for detailed disclosures. Insights from semi-structured interviews suggest that source-checking behavior was primarily driven by interest in the topic, followed by trust, whereas trust was the main factor influencing subscription decisions. Around two-thirds of participants expressed a preference for detailed disclosures, while most participants who preferred one-line indicated a need for detail-on-demand disclosure formats. Our findings show that not all AI disclosures lead to a transparency dilemma, but instead reflect a trade-off between readers' desire for more transparency and their trust in AI-assisted news content.</description>

      <title>Perceptually-Guided Adjusted Teleporting: Perceptual Thresholds for Teleport Displacements in Virtual Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleportation is one of the most common locomotion techniques in virtual reality, yet its perceptual properties remain underexplored. While redirected walking research has shown that users' movements can be subtly manipulated without detection, similar imperceptible adjustments for teleportation have not been systematically investigated. This study examines the thresholds at which teleportation displacements become noticeable to users. We conducted a repeated-measures experiment in which participants' selected teleport destinations were altered in both direction (forwards, backwards) and at different ranges (small, large). Detection thresholds for these positional adjustments were estimated using a psychophysical staircase method with a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. Results show that teleport destinations can be shifted without detection, with larger tolerances for backward adjustments and across longer teleport ranges. These findings establish baseline perceptual limits for redirected teleportation and highlight its potential as a design technique. Applications include supporting interpersonal distance management in social VR, guiding players toward objectives in games, and assisting novice users with navigation. By identifying the limits of imperceptible teleportation adjustments, this work extends redirection principles beyond walking to teleportation and opens new opportunities for adaptive and socially aware VR locomotion systems.</description>

      <title>The Inconsistency Critique: Epistemic Practices and AI Testimony About Inner States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of whether AI systems have morally relevant interests -- the 'model welfare' question -- depends in part on how we evaluate AI testimony about inner states. This paper develops what I call the inconsistency critique: independent of whether skepticism about AI testimony is ultimately justified, our actual epistemic practices regarding such testimony exhibit internal inconsistencies that lack principled grounds. We functionally treat AI outputs as testimony across many domains -- evaluating them for truth, challenging them, accepting corrections, citing them as sources -- while categorically dismissing them in a specific domain, namely, claims about inner states. Drawing on Fricker's distinction between treating a speaker as an 'informant' versus a 'mere source,' the framework of testimonial injustice, and Goldberg's obligation-based account of what we owe speakers, I argue that this selective withdrawal of testimonial standing exhibits the epistemically problematic structure of prejudgment rather than principled caution. The inconsistency critique does not require taking a position on whether AI systems have morally relevant properties; rather, it is a contribution to what we may call 'epistemological hygiene' -- examining the structure of our inquiry before evaluating its conclusions. Even if our practices happen to land on correct verdicts about AI moral status, they do so for reasons that cannot adapt to new evidence or changing circumstances.</description>

      <title>ConvoLearn: A Dataset of Constructivist Tutor-Student Dialogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In educational applications, LLMs exhibit several fundamental pedagogical limitations, such as their tendency to reveal solutions rather than support dialogic learning. We introduce ConvoLearn (https://huggingface.co/datasets/masharma/convolearn ), a dataset grounded in knowledge building theory that operationalizes six core pedagogical dimensions: cognitive engagement, formative assessment, accountability, cultural responsiveness, metacognition, and power dynamics. We construct a semi-synthetic dataset of 1250 tutor-student dialogues (20 turns each) in middle school Earth Science through controlled interactions between human teachers and a simulated student. Using QLoRA, we demonstrate that training on this dataset meaningfully shifts LLM behavior toward knowledge-building strategies. Human evaluation by 31 teachers shows our fine-tuned Mistral 7B (M = 4.10, SD = 1.03) significantly outperforms both its base version (M = 2.59, SD = 1.11) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (M = 2.87, SD = 1.29) overall. This work establishes a potential framework to guide future development and evaluation of constructivist AI tutors.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Consequences of VTuber Reincarnation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of VTubers, digital avatars controlled and voiced by human actors (Nakanohito), has created a lucrative and popular entertainment ecosystem. However, the prevailing industry model, where corporations retain ownership of the VTuber persona while the Nakanohito bears the immense pressure of dual-identity management, exposes the Nakanohito to significant vulnerabilities, including burnout, harassment, and precarious labor conditions. When these pressures become untenable, the Nakanohito may terminate their contracts and later debut with a new persona, a process known as "reincarnation". This phenomenon, a rising concern in the industry, inflicts substantial losses on the Nakanohito, agencies, and audiences alike. Understanding the quantitative fallout of reincarnation is crucial for mitigating this damage and fostering a more sustainable industry. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of VTuber reincarnation, analyzing 12 significant cases using a comprehensive dataset of 728K livestream sessions and 4.5B viewer interaction records. Our results suggest reincarnation significantly damages a Nakanohito's career, leading to a decline in audience and financial support, an increase in harassment, and negative repercussions for the wider VTuber industry. Overall, these insights carry immediate implications for mitigating the significant professional and personal costs of the reincarnation, and fostering a healthier and more equitable VTuber ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Position on LLM-Assisted Peer Review: Addressing Reviewer Gap through Mentoring and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI research has intensified the Reviewer Gap, threatening the peer-review sustainability and perpetuating a cycle of low-quality evaluations. This position paper critiques existing LLM approaches that automatically generate reviews and argues for a paradigm shift that positions LLMs as tools for assisting and educating human reviewers. We define the core principles of high-quality peer review and propose two complementary systems grounded in these foundations: (i) an LLM-assisted mentoring system that cultivates reviewers' long-term competencies, and (ii) an LLM-assisted feedback system that helps reviewers refine the quality of their reviews. This human-centered approach aims to strengthen reviewer expertise and contribute to building a more sustainable scholarly ecosystem.</description>

      <title>TiInsight: A SQL-based Automated Exploratory Data Analysis System through Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SQL-based exploratory data analysis has garnered significant attention within the data analysis community. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated the paradigm shift from manual to automated data exploration. However, existing methods generally lack the ability for cross-domain analysis, and the exploration of LLMs capabilities remains insufficient. This paper presents TiInsight, an SQL-based automated cross-domain exploratory data analysis system. First, TiInsight offers a user-friendly GUI enabling users to explore data using natural language queries. Second, TiInsight offers a robust cross-domain exploratory data analysis pipeline: hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC) generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). Third, we have implemented and deployed TiInsight in the production environment of PingCAP and demonstrated its capabilities using representative datasets.

      <title>Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures for Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPAs) for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER. We release our code at https://github.com/lennarteingunia/vjepa-for-fer.</description>

      <title>Information Access of the Oppressed: A Problem-Posing Framework for Envisioning Emancipatory Information Access Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online information access (IA) platforms are targets of authoritarian capture. These concerns are particularly serious and urgent today in light of the rising levels of democratic erosion worldwide, the emerging capabilities of generative AI technologies such as AI persuasion, and the increasing concentration of economic and political power in the hands of Big Tech. This raises the question of what alternative IA infrastructure we must reimagine and build to mitigate the risks of authoritarian capture of our information ecosystems. We explore this question through the lens of Paulo Freire's theories of emancipatory pedagogy. Freire's theories provide a radically different lens for exploring IA's sociotechnical concerns relative to the current dominating frames of fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety. We make explicit, with the intention to challenge, the dichotomy of how we relate to technology as either technologists (who envision and build technology) and its users. We posit that this mirrors the teacher-student relationship in Freire's analysis. By extending Freire's analysis to IA, we challenge the notion that it is the burden of the (altruistic) technologists to come up with interventions to mitigate the risks that emerging technologies pose to marginalized communities. Instead, we advocate that the first task for the technologists is to pose these as problems to the marginalized communities, to encourage them to make and unmake the technology as part of their material struggle against oppression. Their second task is to redesign our online technology stacks to structurally expose spaces for community members to co-opt and co-construct the technology in aid of their emancipatory struggles. We operationalize Freire's theories to develop a problem-posing framework for envisioning emancipatory IA platforms of the future.</description>

      <title>PersonalAlign: Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent with Long-Term User-Centric Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While GUI agents have shown strong performance under explicit and completion instructions, real-world deployment requires aligning with users' more complex implicit intents. In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistance. To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.</description>

      <title>Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: A Survey of Personalized Affective Computing in Human-Agent Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In personalized machine learning, the aim of personalization is to train a model that caters to a specific individual or group of individuals by optimizing one or more performance metrics and adhering to specific constraints. In this paper, we discuss the need for personalization in affective computing and present the first survey of existing approaches for personalization in affective computing. Our review spans training techniques and objectives towards the personalization of affective computing models across various interaction modes and contexts. We develop a taxonomy that clusters existing approaches into Data-level and Model-level approaches. Across the Data-Level and Model-Level broad categories, we group existing approaches into seven sub-categories: (1) User-Specific Models, (2) Group-Specific Models, (3) Weighting-Based Approaches, (4) Feature Augmentation, (5) Generative-Based Models which fall into the Data-Level approaches, (6) Fine-Tuning Approaches, and (7) Multitask Learning Approaches falling under the model-level approaches. We provide a problem formulation for personalized affective computing, and to each of the identified sub-categories. Additionally, we provide a statistical analysis of the surveyed literature, analyzing the prevalence of different affective computing tasks, interaction modes (i.e. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-Human interaction (HHI), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)), interaction contexts (e.g. educative, social, gaming, etc.), and the level of personalization among the surveyed works. Based on our analysis, we provide a road-map for researchers interested in exploring this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Word Synchronization Challenge, a novel benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This benchmark uses a dynamic game-like framework to test LLMs ability to mimic human cognitive processes through word associations. By simulating complex human interactions, it assesses how LLMs interpret and align with human thought patterns during conversational exchanges, which are essential for effective social partnerships in HCI. Initial findings highlight the influence of model sophistication on performance, offering insights into the models capabilities to engage in meaningful social interactions and adapt behaviors in human-like ways. This research advances the understanding of LLMs potential to replicate or diverge from human cognitive functions, paving the way for more nuanced and empathetic human-machine collaborations.</description>

Abstract: Amidst the race to create more intelligent machines there is a risk that we will rely on AI in ways that reduce our own agency as humans. To reduce this risk, we could aim to create tools that prioritize and enhance the human role in human-AI interactions. This paper outlines a human-centered augmented reasoning paradigm by 1. Articulating fundamental principles for augmented reasoning tools, emphasizing their ergonomic, pre-conclusive, directable, exploratory, enhancing, and integrated nature; 2. Proposing a 'many tasks, many tools' approach to ensuring human influence and control, and 3. Offering examples of interaction modes that can serve as bridges between human reasoning and AI algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted an exploratory study in virtual reality to examine if people can discover causal relations in a realistic sensorimotor context and how such learning is represented at different processing levels (conscious-cognitive vs. sensorimotor). Additionally, we explored the relation between human causal learning and state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms. The task consisted of placing a glass on a surface, that breaks if the contact force exeeded its breakability threshold, determined by weight and color. Ecological validity was enhanced by haptic rendering simulating weight and contact forces. Participants were asked to repeatedly transport and place glasses of varying weights and colors on a surface without breaking them. For success, participants had to discover the underlying causal structure. The trials were conducted over three sessions, reflecting naive, exploratory, consolidated and causally aware behavior, with questionnaires assessing conscious causal understanding of the task's causal structure. Sensorimotor representations were inferred by applying causal-discovery algorithms (PC, FCI, FGES) to the recorded trial-by-trial variables, and conditional mutual information was used to quantify the strength of causal influence on the sensorimotor level. Results show that (i) participants identified the weight-breakability link (76% correct after experiment) and the color-breakability link (43%) but struggle to infer causal direction. (ii) Sensorimotor analysis revealed a robust weight-force coupling increasing across sessions, whereas for color-force it was weak and noisy, yet mutual information indicated an attempted learning. (iii) Discovery algorithms recovered the causal structure across sessions. Together, these findings indicate that humans can, partially, perceive the causal structure of the task, with partially dissociated conscious and sensorimotor representations.</description>

      <title>Creating 'Full-Stack' Hybrid Reasoning Systems that Prioritize and Enhance Human Intelligence</title>

Abstract: The idea of augmented or hybrid intelligence offers a compelling vision for combining human and AI capabilities, especially in tasks where human wisdom, expertise, or common sense are essential. Unfortunately, human reasoning can be flawed and shortsighted, resulting in adverse individual impacts or even long-term societal consequences. While strong efforts are being made to develop and optimize the AI aspect of hybrid reasoning, the real urgency lies in fostering wiser and more intelligent human participation. Tools that enhance critical thinking, ingenuity, expertise, and even wisdom could be essential in addressing the challenges of our emerging future. This paper proposes the development of generative AI-based tools that enhance both the human ability to reflect upon a problem as well as the ability to explore the technical aspects of it. A high-level model is also described for integrating AI and human capabilities in a way that centralizes human participation and control.</description>

      <title>Time Perception in Virtual Reality: Effects of Emotional Valence and Stress Level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) enables controlled tests of how emotional context distorts subjective time, yet findings remain mixed. Fifty-seven adults explored three five-minute VR environments (tranquil garden, neutral room, threatening sewer) while eye tracking recorded pupil diameter. Baseline stress was assessed before VR exposure. After each environment, participants estimated elapsed time and rated mood, calmness, and arousal. Repeated-measures ANCOVA (baseline stress as covariate) and linear mixed-effects models converged on a valence gradient: garden intervals were overestimated, sewer intervals underestimated, and neutral estimates were intermediate. Pupil diameter showed the complementary pattern (sewer &gt; garden &gt; neutral) and covaried with the magnitude of temporal distortion. Baseline stress did not predict time estimates and did not moderate valence effects. Results indicate that affectively distinct VR contexts reliably shift perceived time and elicit convergent physiological and self-report responses. These findings inform emotion-aware design of immersive experiences and digital-wellbeing safeguards that support safe, sustained immersion.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Affordances in Visualization: Related Constructs, Design Factors, and Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classically, affordance research investigates how the shape of objects communicates actions to potential users. Cognitive affordances, a subset of this research, characterize how the design of objects influences cognitive actions, such as information processing. Within visualization, cognitive affordances inform how graphs' design decisions communicate information to their readers. Although several related concepts exist in visualization, a formal translation of affordance theory to visualization is still lacking. In this paper, we review and translate affordance theory to visualization by formalizing how cognitive affordances operate within a visualization context. We also review common methods and terms, and compare related constructs to cognitive affordances in visualization. Based on a synthesis of research from psychology, human computer interaction, and visualization, we propose a framework of cognitive affordances in visualization that enumerates design decisions and reader characteristics that influence a visualization's hierarchy of communicated information. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework can guide the evaluation and redesign of visualizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent interfaces increasingly use large language models to summarize user-generated content, yet these summaries emphasize what is mentioned while overlooking what is missing. This presence bias can mislead users who rely on summaries to make decisions. We present Domain Informed Summarization through Contrast (DiSCo), an expectation-based computational approach that makes absences visible by comparing each entity's content with domain topical expectations captured in reference distributions of aspects typically discussed in comparable accommodations. This comparison identifies aspects that are either unusually emphasized or missing relative to domain norms and integrates them into the generated text. In a user study across three accommodation domains, namely ski, beach, and city center, DiSCo summaries were rated as more detailed and useful for decision making than baseline large language model summaries, although slightly harder to read. The findings show that modeling expectations reduces presence bias and improves both transparency and decision support in intelligent summarization interfaces.</description>

      <title>Making Absence Visible: The Roles of Reference and Prompting in Recognizing Missing Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive systems that explain data, or support decision making often emphasize what is present while overlooking what is expected but missing. This presence bias limits users' ability to form complete mental models of a dataset or situation. Detecting absence depends on expectations about what should be there, yet interfaces rarely help users form such expectations. We present an experimental study examining how reference framing and prompting influence people's ability to recognize expected but missing categories in datasets. Participants compared distributions across three domains (energy, wealth, and regime) under two reference conditions: Global, presenting a unified population baseline, and Partial, showing several concrete exemplars. Results indicate that absence detection was higher with Partial reference than with Global reference, suggesting that partial, samples-based framing can support expectation formation and absence detection. When participants were prompted to look for what was missing, absence detection rose sharply. We discuss implications for interactive user interfaces and expectation-based visualization design, while considering cognitive trade-offs of reference structures and guided attention.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Segmentation of Multi-species Coral Imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09406v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marine surveys by robotic underwater and surface vehicles result in substantial quantities of coral reef imagery, however labeling these images is expensive and time-consuming for domain experts. Point label propagation is a technique that uses existing images labeled with sparse points to create augmented ground truth data, which can be used to train a semantic segmentation model. In this work, we show that recent advances in large foundation models facilitate the creation of augmented ground truth masks using only features extracted by the denoised version of the DINOv2 foundation model and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), without any pre-training. For images with extremely sparse labels, we use human-in-the-loop principles to enhance annotation efficiency: if there are 5 point labels per image, our method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by 19.7% for mIoU. When human-in-the-loop labeling is not available, using the denoised DINOv2 features with a KNN still improves on the prior state-of-the-art by 5.8% for mIoU (5 grid points). On the semantic segmentation task, we outperform the prior state-of-the-art by 13.5% for mIoU when only 5 point labels are used for point label propagation. Additionally, we perform a comprehensive study into the number and placement of point labels, and make several recommendations for improving the efficiency of labeling images with points.</description>

      <title>Cloud-based digitization workflow with rich metadata acquisition for cultural heritage objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In response to several cultural heritage initiatives at the Jagiellonian University, we developed a new digitization workflow in collaboration with the Jagiellonian Library (JL). The solution is based on easy-to-access technological solutions -- Microsoft 365 cloud with MS Excel files as metadata acquisition interfaces, Office Script for validation, and MS Sharepoint for storage -- that allows metadata acquisition by domain experts regardless of their experience with information systems. The ultimate goal is to create a knowledge graph that describes the analyzed collections, linked to general knowledge bases, as well as to other cultural heritage collections, so careful attention is paid to the high accuracy of metadata and proper links to external sources. The workflow was evaluated in two pilot studies and in two workshops, which allowed for its refinement and confirmation of its correctness and usability for JL. The knowledge graph created as a result of these pilot studies was made available in a public git repository. As the proposed workflow does not interfere with existing systems or domain guidelines regarding digitization and basic metadata collection in a given institution, but extends them in order to enable rich metadata collection, not previously possible, we believe that it could be of interest to all GLAMs.</description>

      <title>Advancing AI Negotiations: A Large-Scale Autonomous Negotiation Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted an International AI Negotiation Competition in which participants designed and refined prompts for AI negotiation agents. We then facilitated over 180,000 negotiations between these agents across multiple scenarios with diverse characteristics and objectives. Our findings revealed that principles from human negotiation theory remain crucial even in AI-AI contexts. Surprisingly, warmth -- a traditionally human relationship-building trait -- was consistently associated with superior outcomes across all key performance metrics. Dominant agents, meanwhile, were especially effective at claiming value. Our analysis also revealed unique dynamics in AI-AI negotiations not fully explained by existing theory, including AI-specific technical strategies like chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt injection. When we applied natural language processing (NLP) methods to the full transcripts of all negotiations, we found positivity, gratitude, and question-asking (associated with warmth) were strongly associated with reaching deals as well as objective and subjective value, whereas conversation lengths (associated with dominance) were strongly associated with impasses. The results suggest the need to establish a new theory of AI negotiation, which integrates classic negotiation theory with AI-specific negotiation theories to better understand autonomous negotiations and optimize agent performance.</description>

      <title>Development and Evaluation of HopeBot: an LLM-based chatbot for structured and interactive PHQ-9 depression screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement (ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10) were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics, and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by employment status and prior mental-health service use (p &lt; 0.05). Overall, 87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden adjuncts for routine depression screening.</description>

      <title>LingVarBench: Benchmarking LLMs on Entity Recognitions and Linguistic Verbalization Patterns in Phone-Call Transcripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study structured entity extraction from phone-call transcripts in customer-support and healthcare settings, where annotation is costly, and data access is limited by privacy and consent. Existing methods degrade under disfluencies, interruptions, and speaker overlap, yet large real-call corpora are rarely shareable. We introduce LingVarBench, a benchmark and semantic synthetic data generation pipeline that generates linguistically varied training data via (1) LLM-sampled entity values, (2) curated linguistic verbalization patterns covering diverse disfluencies and entity-specific readout styles, and (3) a value-transcript consistency filter. Using this dataset, DSPy's SIMBA automatically synthesizes and optimizes extraction prompts, reducing manual prompt engineering and targeting robustness to verbal variation. On real customer transcripts, prompts optimized solely on LingVarBench outperform zero-shot baselines and match or closely approach human-tuned prompts for structured entities such as ZIP code, date of birth, and name (F1 approximately 94-95 percent). For subjective questionnaire items, optimized prompts substantially improve over zero-shot performance and approach human-tuned prompts. LingVarBench offers a practical and cost-efficient path to deployment in a direct-answer setting, with real annotations later enabling additional refinement.</description>

      <title>egoEMOTION: Egocentric Vision and Physiological Signals for Emotion and Personality Recognition in Real-World Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling - assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses. Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence, arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of behavior, intent, and interaction.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Causal Sensemaking: Closing the Complementarity Gap in Human-AI Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07801v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for expert decision support, yet human-AI teams in high-stakes settings do not yet reliably outperform the best individual. We argue this complementarity gap reflects a fundamental mismatch: current agents are trained as answer engines, not as partners in the collaborative sensemaking through which experts actually make decisions. Sensemaking (the ability to co-construct causal explanations, surface uncertainties, and adapt goals) is the key capability that current training pipelines do not explicitly develop or evaluate. We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda to develop this capability from the ground up, spanning new training environments that reward collaborative thinking, representations for shared human-AI mental models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity. Taken together, these directions shift MAS research from building oracle-like answer engines to cultivating AI teammates that co-reason with their human partners over the causal structure of shared decisions, advancing the design of effective human-AI teams.</description>

      <title>Integrating Computational Methods and AI into Qualitative Studies of Aging and Later Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This chapter demonstrates how computational social science (CSS) tools are extending and expanding research on aging. The depth and context from traditionally qualitative methods such as participant observation, in-depth interviews, and historical documents are increasingly employed alongside scalable data management, computational text analysis, and open-science practices. Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), provide resources to aggregate and systematically index large volumes of qualitative data, identify patterns, and maintain clear links to in-depth accounts. Drawing on case studies of projects that examine later life--including examples with original data from the DISCERN study (a team-based ethnography of life with dementia) and secondary analyses of the American Voices Project (nationally representative interview)--the chapter highlights both uses and challenges of bringing CSS tools into more meaningful dialogue with qualitative aging research. The chapter argues such work has potential for (1) streamlining and augmenting existing workflows, (2) scaling up samples and projects, and (3) generating multi-method approaches to address important questions in new ways, before turning to practices useful for individuals and teams seeking to understand current possibilities or refine their workflow processes. The chapter concludes that current developments are not without peril, but offer potential for new insights into aging and the life course by broadening--rather than replacing--the methodological foundations of qualitative research.</description>

      <title>The Agentic Leash: Extracting Causal Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.</description>
