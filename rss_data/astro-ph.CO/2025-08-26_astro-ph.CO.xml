      <title>Signatures and bias assessment of rotation in galaxy cluster members</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possible presence of systematic rotation in the member galaxies of a sample of 17 nearby ($z&lt;0.1$), rich (at least 80 identified members) Abell clusters. We also assess the extent to which low-number statistics may influence the recovery of the rotation parameters. Following the methods often used in the context of globular clusters and of clusters of galaxies, we estimate a representative value of the systematic rotation velocity and the position angle of the projected rotation axis for the set of spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies within 1.5 Mpc from the centre of each cluster. We study the robustness of our rotational velocity measurements as a function of the number of galaxies included in the analysis with a bootstrapping technique. Eight clusters with sufficiently abundant and regular data (A1367, A1650, A2029, A2065, A2142, A2199, A2255 and A2670) exhibit a significantly high rotational velocity, when compared to their velocity dispersion ($v_{rot}/\sigma\geq 0.15$). Interestingly, three of them (A1650, A2029 and A2199) are confirmed to be cool-core, relaxed clusters with no evidence of recent mergers, as suggested by X-ray observational data. We also find a general tendency to overestimate the value of $v_{rot}$ when the number of galaxies with measured velocities is reduced, for which we put forward an analytical justification.</description>

      <title>Varying fundamental constants cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmography is a model-independent phenomenological approach to observational cosmology, relying on Taylor series expansions of physical quantities as a function of the cosmological redshift or other analogous variables. A recent work developed the formalism for a cosmographic analysis of astrophysical and local measurements of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and provided first constraints on the corresponding parameters. Here we update the earlier work, both by including more recent measurements of $\alpha$, and by extending it to other fundamental dimensionless couplings. We find no statistically significant evidence for such variations, and place stringent constraints on the first two terms of all these cosmographic series: the linear coefficient in the $\alpha$ series is constrained to parts per billion level, thanks to recently improved atomic clock constraints, while the other coefficients are constrained to parts per million level. Additionally, we use the same data to place cosmographic constraints on models from a broad class of Grand Unified Theories in which varying fundamental constants occur, and highlight how future data can provide a discriminating cosmographic test between freezing and thawing dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Search for the radiative decay of the cosmic neutrino background through spectral measurements of the cosmic infrared background using PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to search for a faint yet distinguishable contribution to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) spectrum arising from the radiative decay of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). In the Standard Model of particle physics, neutrino decay is highly suppressed, with a predicted lifetime on the order of $10^{43}$ years. However, non-standard models suggest the possibility of significantly shorter lifetimes, ranging from $10^{12}$ to $10^{17}$ years. Observations to date, however, only provide a lower limit of approximately $10^{12}$ years for the neutrino lifetime. In PRIMA's low-resolution mode ($R \sim 100$), a diffuse background analysis, combined with the removal of point sources associated with known galaxies in a wide-field ($\sim 1$ square degree) spectroscopic survey covering in the 24-240 $\mu$m range could facilitate a search for neutrino decay lifetimes up to $O(10^{15})$ years. The expected signal from C$\nu$B decay at 50 $\mu$m for a neutrino lifetime of $O(10^{15})$ years is more than an order of magnitude fainter than the CIB and over three orders of magnitude fainter than the zodiacal emission foreground. Taking advantage of the characteristic spectral features of C$\nu$B decay, this level of sensitivity can be achieved with approximately 100 hours of total observation time, based on estimated surface brightness sensitivity. Searching for neutrino decay at this sensitivity could place strong constraints on several non-standard theories. A positive detection would provide compelling evidence for non-standard contributions to neutrino decay and could directly reveal the cosmic neutrino background. Furthermore, the decay photon spectrum could offer insights into the absolute mass of neutrinos, and key cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Connecting The Hierarchically Merging Binary Black Hole Population To Their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes with masses $\sim\,80-150\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ suggests that some proportion of black hole binary systems form hierarchically in dense astrophysical environments, as most stellar evolution models cannot explain the origin of these massive black holes through isolated binary evolution. A significant fraction of such mergers could occur in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN), however connecting individual black hole mergers to host galaxies is a challenging endeavor due to large localization uncertainties. We assess the feasibility of determining the fraction of hierarchically merging black hole binaries by computing the angular cross-correlation between gravitational wave localization posteriors and galaxy catalog skymaps. We forecast when the clustering of gravitational wave sky localizations can be measured accurately enough to distinguish the AGN origin scenario from hierarchical mergers in galaxies that do not host AGN. We find that if the observed merging population is dominated by binaries formed dynamically in AGN, then this could be determined with $\mathcal{O}(5000)$ mergers detected at the sensitivity that is projected for the upcoming A\# gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Lensing amplitude anomaly and varying electron mass alleviate the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological measurements have revealed tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, notably discrepancies in the Hubble constant and $S_8$ parameter. Additionally, recent observations suggested evidence of a possible non-flat spatial curvature and an anomalous CMB lensing amplitude that beyond the $\Lambda$CDM framework. In this study, we explore whether introducing a variation in the electron mass $m_e$, allowing non-zero spatial curvature $\Omega_K$, and a free lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ can resolve these persistent tensions. Without relying on any local Universe measurements, we obtain $H_0 = 69.61^{+0.60}_{-0.55} \rm \, km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$ and $S_8= 0.808\pm0.012$, with $\Delta m_e / m_e = 0.0109^{+0.0066}_{-0.0062}$ and $A_{\rm lens} = 1.030^{+0.039}_{-0.037}$, both of which exceed the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We find no indication of spatial curvature deviating from flatness, even when including the Cosmic Chronometers and SNe Ia samples. Our results point to a promising direction for cosmological models to reconcile these discrepancies, although more precise data from future experiments will be necessary to clarify these modifications.</description>

      <title>Quintessential dark energy crossing the phantom divide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent results from the DESI collaboration, we explore two classes of quintessence models that can give rise to crossing of the dark energy equation of state through the ``phantom divide'' $w=-1$. These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\dot\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.</description>

      <title>Tracing Signatures of Modified Gravity in Redshift-Space Galaxy Bispectrum Multipoles: Prospects for Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the galaxy bispectrum multipoles in the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, where a scalar degree of freedom mediates a fifth force that is screened in high-density environments. The model is specified by $f_{R0}$, the present-day background value of the scalar field, which controls the strength of deviations from General Relativity (GR). Using perturbation theory, we compute the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum with the full scale- and time-dependent second-order kernels, incorporating corrections from the scale-dependent growth rate and nonlinear screening. Expanding the bispectrum in spherical harmonics, we analyze the sensitivity of the multipoles to modified gravity and forecast their detectability in a \textit{Euclid}-like survey. The monopole ($B_0^0$) and quadrupole ($B_2^0$) show the strongest signatures, with relative deviations of $2\%$-$8\%$ at $z=0.7$ and $k_1\simeq0.3\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for $f_{R0}=10^{-5}$. Higher multipoles provide weaker but complementary signals. Finger-of-God damping and galaxy bias significantly modulate the results, requiring joint modeling of these nuisance parameters. For \textit{Euclid}, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios up to $\sim30$ for the monopole and $\sim15$ for the quadrupole. These results demonstrate that bispectrum multipoles are a powerful probe of gravity, capable of breaking degeneracies with bias and velocity effects and strengthening constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Is Not That Into You: Variable Couplings after DESI DR2 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) scenarios, the interaction function typically includes a coupling parameter $\xi$ that quantifies the strength of energy exchange between the dark sectors. While $\xi$ is often assumed to be constant, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a time-dependent coupling, which could provide a more general and realistic description of dark sector dynamics. In this work, we study two widely used interacting models involving pressureless DM and DE, where the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with the scale factor $a$. Specifically, we consider two parametrizations: $\xi(a) = \xi_0 + \xi_a (1-a)$ and $\xi(a) = \xi_0 \left(1 + \frac{1-a}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} \right)$, and constrain them using the latest cosmological observations, including Planck 2018 CMB data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and multiple Type Ia supernovae samples. Our results show that one scenario yields evidence for a non-zero interaction at more than 95\% confidence level, while the remaining cases indicate at most mild or inconclusive signs of interaction. These findings highlight the potential of variable coupling models and the importance of continued investigation into the nature of the dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Probing the HI distribution at small scales using 21-cm Intensity Mapping at large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) holds the potential to map the large-scale structures in the Universe over a wide redshift range $(z \lesssim 5.5)$, measure cosmological parameters, and shed light on the nature of dark energy. In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation, which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured 21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \le k_{ul} = 0.32 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely $[\Omega_{\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS and BS with an independent measurement of $\Omega_{\rm HI} $, we show that it is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation. We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy formation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores redshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we plan to address in future work.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Origin of Primordial Black Holes: A Viable Dark Matter Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are compelling candidates for explaining the present-day relic abundance of cold dark matter (CDM), yet their formation typically requires finely tuned early-universe dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel PBH formation mechanism within a well-established magnetogenesis framework. This scenario simultaneously accounts for the large-scale magnetic fields observed today and generates an enhanced curvature power spectrum at intermediate scales, leading to PBH formation with masses that can survive until the present epoch. We identify a narrow reheating temperature range, $10^5\,\mathrm{GeV} \leq T_{re} \leq 3\times 10^5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, within which the resulting PBHs can constitute the entirety of the observed CDM abundance. Furthermore, our model predicts a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background as a byproduct of the PBH formation process. Remarkably, the predicted GW signal lies within the sensitivity reach of upcoming space-based interferometers, such as the LISA, DECIGO, or SKA mission, offering a direct observational probe of this PBH generation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Large $n$-point Functions in Resonant Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a qualitatively new regime of inflationary models with small and rapid oscillations in the potential--resonant non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the standard scenario, where most of the observable information is encoded in the power spectrum, in this regime the oscillatory signal predominantly appears in higher-order correlation functions with large $n$. This behavior emerges when the oscillation frequency $\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the theory, $4\pi f$. However, as noted by Hook and Rattazzi [2306.12489], the actual cutoff is somewhat higher--though only logarithmically--when the amplitude of the oscillations is small. We identify a phenomenologically relevant window in which $n$-point functions with $3 \lesssim n \lesssim 9$ are potentially observable. In this regime, the signal exhibits 350 - 1000 oscillations per decade in $k$.</description>

      <title>Unified Gas Heating Constraints on Extended Dark Matter Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first unified constraints on a broad class of extended dark matter compact objects (EDCOs) from interstellar gas heating. These include axion stars, Q-balls, axion miniclusters, dark fermion stars and primordial black holes surrounded by dark matter halos, which arise in a wide range of theories beyond the Standard Model. As such massive objects traverse the interstellar medium, their gravitational influence generates wakes and, if sufficiently compact, drives accretion flows that heat gas in their vicinity. Our general framework extends standard dynamical friction treatments by incorporating finite-size effects, internal density profiles, gas penetration through objects, and criteria for accretion disk formation. We perform detailed numerical calculations of wake formation and gas heating and apply our results to the Leo T dwarf galaxy, establishing new constraints on the dark matter fraction in EDCOs heavier than a solar mass spanning several orders of magnitude in both mass and abundance.</description>

      <title>Radiation pressure role in accreting massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on the circumbinary discs surrounding accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at milli-parsec separations, using 3D hyper-Lagrangian resolution hydrodynamic simulations. The circumbinary discs in our simulations evolve under an adiabatic equation of state. The gas temperature is therefore allowed to change through viscous heating, black-body cooling and self-gravity. We take a significant step further by including the contribution of radiation pressure in the simulations. We model binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q= 0.7, 1$. We find that the radiation pressure significantly alters the vertical and thermal structure of the disc, resulting in a geometrically thinner, therefore colder configuration. This leads to a reduced accretion rate onto the binary and suppresses cavity eccentricity growth and precession in circular equal mass binaries. The binary eccentricity remains approximately constant, while the semi-major axis decreases over time due to net negative torque, regardless of the initial binary orbital parameters.</description>

      <title>Imprints of screened dark energy on non-local quantum correlations</title>

Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>

      <title>Impacts of axion cooling on the direct detection of supernova axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.</description>

      <title>Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</description>

      <title>String Corrected Scalar Field Inflation Compatible with the ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the impact of the first string corrections of minimally coupled single scalar field theory on inflationary dynamics. Specifically we consider separately the string corrections $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi)c_2\,\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ and $\sim \alpha'c \square \phi \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$, where $\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale. Our aim is to develop a theory which is self consistent in the sense that the field equations reproduce themselves in the slow-roll approximation. Such a requirement for the theory with $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi) c_2\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ resulted to a trivial non-minimal coupling function $\xi(\phi)$, however a self-consistent framework emerged from the theory with correction term $\sim \alpha' c \square \phi \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$. The resulting theory can easily be worked out analytically and we obtained an inflationary theory that can easily be fitted with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope constraints on the scalar spectral index and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>DUCA: Dynamic Universe Cosmological Analysis. II. The impact of clustering dark energy on the halo mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are powerful probes of cosmology, and the halo mass function (HMF) serves as a fundamental tool for extracting cosmological information. Previous calibrations of the HMF in dynamical dark energy (DE) models either assumed a homogeneous DE component or a fixed sound speed of unity, which strongly suppresses DE perturbations. We extend the HMF calibration to clustering dark energy (CDE) models by allowing for a sound speed $(c_{\rm s})$ value different than unity. This generalization enables a broader description of the impact of DE perturbations on structure formation. Our approach builds upon the DUCA simulation suite that accounts for DE at the background and perturbative levels. We present an HMF calibration based on introducing an effective peak height while maintaining the multiplicity function as previously calibrated. The effective peak height is written as a function of the peak height computed using the matter power spectrum of the homogeneous DE case, but it is modulated by the amplitude of DE and matter perturbations on the non-homogeneous case at the turnaround. The model depends on one single parameter, which we calibrate using $N$-body simulations, following a Bayesian approach. The resulting HMF model achieves sub-percent accuracy over a wide range of $c_{\rm s}$ values. Our analysis reveals that, although the overall impact of CDE on halo abundances remains modest (typically a few percent), the effects are more pronounced in non-phantom DE scenarios. Our model qualitatively agrees with predictions based on the spherical collapse model, but predicts a significantly lower impact for low $c_{\rm s}$. Our results underscore the need for more precise modeling of CDE's nonlinear regime. Numerical simulations and theoretical approaches must be advanced to capture the complex interplay between DE perturbations and matter fully.</description>

      <title>DESI DR1 Ly$\alpha$ 1D power spectrum: The optimal estimator measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional power spectrum $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ of Ly$\alpha$ forest offers rich insights into cosmological and astrophysical parameters, including constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, warm dark matter models, and the thermal state of the intergalactic medium. We present the measurement of $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ using the optimal quadratic maximum likelihood estimator applied to over 300,000 Ly$\alpha$ quasars from Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. This sample represents the largest to date for $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurements and is larger than the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) by a factor of 1.7. We conduct a meticulous investigation of instrumental and analysis systematics and quantify their impact on $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$. This includes the development of a cross-exposure estimator that eliminates the need to model the pipeline noise and has strong potential for future $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurements. We also present new insights into metal contamination through the 1D correlation function. Using a fitting function we measure the evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ forest bias with high precision: $b_F(z) = (-0.218\pm0.002)\times((1 + z) / 4)^{2.96\pm0.06}$. In a companion validation paper, we substantially extend our previous suite of CCD image simulations to quantify the pipeline's exquisite performance accurately. In another companion paper, we present DR1 $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurements using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach to power spectrum estimation. These two measurements produce a forest bias parameter that differs by 2.2 sigma. However, our model is simplistic, so this disagreement will be investigated in future work.</description>

      <title>Kination-like Era Driven by the Effective Inflaton/Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the minimal $U(1)_X$ extended Standard Model, we explore cosmic inflation where the $U(1)_X$ Higgs field serves as the inflaton. We demonstrate that a stiff era with an equation of state $w &gt; 1/3$ can emerge during the inflaton's oscillatory phase after inflation, driven by the Coleman-Weinberg potential of the inflaton, arising due to radiative corrections. This leads to significant modulation and enhancement of the irreducible stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from inflation, deviating from the conventional scale-invariant spectrum. Such a distinct GW spectrum could be detectable by next-generation GW interferometer missions, such as U-DECIGO. In our framework, the GW spectrum depends on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling and the mass of the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($Z^\prime$). As a result, future GW observations and $Z^\prime$ boson resonance searches at high-energy collider experiments are complementary to one another.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble parameter with the 21 cm brightness temperature signal in a universe with inhomogeneities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the 21\,cm brightness temperature as a probe of the Hubble tension in the framework of an inhomogeneous cosmological model. Employing Buchert's averaging formalism to study the effect of inhomogeneities on the background evolution, we consider scaling laws for the backreaction and curvature consistent with structure formation simulations. We calibrate the effective matter density using MCMC analysis using Union 2.1 Supernova Ia data. Our results show that a higher Hubble constant ($\sim73$\,km/s/Mpc) leads to a shallower absorption feature in the brightness temperature versus redshift curve. On the other hand, a lower value ($\sim67$\,km/s/Mpc) produces a remarkable dip in the brightness temperature $T_{21}$. Such a substantial difference is absent in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings indicate that inhomogeneities could significantly affect the 21\,cm signal, and may shed further light on the different measurements of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fuzzy dark matter scenarios, the quantum wave nature of ultralight axion-like particles generates stochastic density fluctuations inside dark matter halos. These fluctuations, known as granules, perturb the orbits of subhalos and other orbiting bodies. While previous studies have simulated these effects using N-body techniques or modeled them statistically using diffusion approximations, we propose an alternative framework based on representing the perturbations as a Fourier series with random coefficients, which can be applied to individual orbits, not just populations. We extend the model to finite-size subhalos, identifying a critical length scale below which subhalos behave as point-mass particles. In contrast, larger subhalos exhibit suppressed perturbations from granules due to their extended mass profiles. Using FDM-Simulator, we validate our finite-size model by isolating granule accelerations and confirming their statistical effects on subhalo dynamics.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09228v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. Our analysis reveals that the predicted value of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ by the DESI DR2 LRG1 and LRG3+ELG1 datapoints deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction and from different supernova compilations. We find that analyzing the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers strongly affects the model predictions especially $\omega_0$, which shifts from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Equilibration in the Merging Galaxy Cluster Abell 665</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers drive powerful shock fronts that heat the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) and accelerate particles, redistributing the energy in a merger. Abell 665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock ($M \sim 3$) and provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization timescale of the ICM, particularly the electron-ion equilibration timescale. Understanding this timescale is crucial for determining how energy from the merger is distributed between thermal and non-thermal particle populations. Using $\sim$200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature distribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an instant, collisionless model where ions and electrons are immediately heated at the shock front, and (2) a collisional model where electrons are initially adiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the ions over $\sim$100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed equilibration model, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium with the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over $t_{eq} = (4.0 \pm 3.4) \times 10^8$ yrs. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate that the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ($M = 2.8 \pm 0.7$), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past studies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing how thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with implications for galaxy cluster evolution, large scale structure formation, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis from magnetic helicity of gauged $\text{U}(1)_{B-L}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the $B-L$ symmetry is gauged with the addition of right-handed neutrinos, the standard model $B-L$ current is anomalous with respect to the $B-L$ gauge field itself. Then, the anomaly relation implies that the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is related to the standard model $B-L$ charges, although the whole universe is $B-L$ neutral with right-handed neutrinos. Based on this, we propose a new leptogenesis scenario with the gauged $B-L$ symmetry as follows. First, the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is generated, e.g., by the axion inflation, together with the standard model and right-handed neutrino $B-L$ charges, with the net $B-L$ charge kept zero. The $B-L$ charges in the standard model and right-handed neutrino sectors are then subject to washout effects from the interactions between them. After the washout effects decouple, the $B-L$ gauge symmetry is Higgsed and the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field decays and generates $B-L$ charges in the both sector; thanks to the washout effects, we obtain a non-zero $B-L$ asymmetry. We show that the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated in this scenario, discussing the decay of the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field and the interactions between the right-handed neutrinos and the standard model particles.</description>

      <title>Inflationary scenarios beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this chapter is to explain in clear and pedagogical terms how some particle-physics models and/or mechanisms can naturally lead to inflation and how this can provide testable predictions that can help us find new physics effects. Two well-established features of theoretical particle physics are linked to an essential property of inflation, a naturally-flat inflaton potential: (1) scale invariance, broken by small quantum corrections, and (2) Goldstone's theorem. It is also illustrated how to combine several scenarios of this type to obtain a rather general particle-physics motivated inflationary setup.</description>

      <title>Accretion onto supermassive and intermediate mass black holes in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion is the dominant contribution to the cosmic massive black hole density in the Universe today. Yet, modelling it in cosmological simulations is challenging due to the dynamic range involved, as well as the theoretical uncertainties of the underlying mechanisms driving accretion from galactic to black hole horizon scales. We present a simple, flexible parametrization for gas inflows onto massive black holes in order to manage this uncertainty in large-volume cosmological simulations. This is done as part of the "Learning the Universe'' collaboration, which aims to jointly infer the initial conditions and physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe using a Bayesian forward-modelling approach. To allow such a forward-modelling, we update the prescription for accretion with a two-parameter free-fall based inflow estimate that allows for a radius-dependent inflow rate and add a simple model for unresolved accretion disks. We use uniform resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and the IllustrisTNG framework to study the massive black hole population and its dependence on the introduced model parameters. Once the parameters of the accretion formula are chosen to result in a roughly similar redshift zero black hole mass density, the differences caused by the details in the accretion formula are moderate in the supermassive black hole regime, indicating that it is difficult to distinguish between accretion mechanisms based on luminous active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes. Applying the same models to intermediate mass black holes at high redshift, however, reveals significantly different accretion rates in high redshift, moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei and different frequencies and mass distributions of intermediate mass black hole mergers for the same black hole formation model.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter-Electron Interactions in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider Dark Matter (DM) interactions and study the same in the light of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) data. In particular, we focus on the DM-electron interactions. Assuming that such interactions are mediated by rather heavy mediators, we consider effective operators describing the relevant interaction terms in the lagrangian. The presence of such interaction terms leads to both DM annihilation and DM-electron scattering (drag). We focus on operators which lead to velocity-independent DM annihilation and DM-electron scattering cross-sections. Using the CMBR data, we study the implications of both of these effects, imposing constraints on the respective effective operators. This analysis underscores the importance of taking both scattering and annihilation processes into consideration in the study of DM interactions. We observe that the constraints on the DM annihilation and scattering cross-sections can change, up to about 13\% and 12\%, respectively, for the benchmark scenarios we considered, depending on the mass of DM, as compared to the scenario where only DM annihilation is accounted for.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.</description>

      <title>The Lifespan of our Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements claim that the dark energy equation of state $w \ne -1$. This observation can be explained by the axion Dark Energy (aDE) model of an ultralight axion plus a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Despite a relatively large degeneracy, there is a high probability that $\Lambda &lt;0$. This negative $\Lambda$ leads the universe to end in a big crunch. Using the best-fit values of the model as a benchmark, we find the lifespan of our universe to be 33 billion years.</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we have taken into account.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like Taiji and LISA promises deep insights into strong-field gravity and black hole physics. However, the complex, highly degenerate, and non-convex likelihood landscapes characteristic of EMRI parameter spaces pose severe challenges for conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Under realistic instrumental noise and broad priors, these methods demand impractical computational costs but are prone to becoming trapped in local maxima, leading to biased and unreliable parameter estimates. To address this, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a novel Bayesian framework that integrates continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By generating high-likelihood regions via CNFs and refining them through PTMCMC, FM-MCMC enables robust exploration of the nontrivial parameter spaces, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency and, more importantly, ensuring statistically reliable and unbiased inference. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference, FM-MCMC could unlock the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>
