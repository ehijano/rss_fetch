      <title>Epistatic pathways in evolvable mechanical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elastic spring network is an example of evolvable matter. It can be pruned to couple separated pairs of nodes so that when a strain is applied to one of them, the other responds either in-phase or out-of-phase. This produces two pruned networks with incompatible functions that are nearly identical but differ from each other by a set of "mutations," each of which removes or adds a single bond in the network. The effect of multiple mutations is epistatic; that is, the effect of a mutation depends on what other mutations have already occurred. We generate ensembles of network pairs that differ by a fixed number, $M$, of discrete mutations and evaluate all $M!$ mutational paths between the in- and out-of phase behaviors up to $M = 14$. With a threshold response for the network to be considered functional, so that non-functional networks are disallowed, only some mutational pathways are viable. We find that there is a surprisingly high critical response threshold above which no evolutionarily viable path exists between the two networks. The few remaining pathways at this critical value dictate much of the behavior along the evolutionary trajectory. In most cases, the mutations break up into two distinct classes. The analysis clarifies how the number of mutations and the position of a mutation along the pathway affect the evolutionary outcome.</description>

      <title>Molecular anatomy of the pressure anisotropy in the interface of one and two component fluids: local thermodynamic description of the interfacial tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the decomposition of the pressure into the kinetic and the intermolecular contributions, we show that the pressure anisotropy in the fluid interface, which is the source of the interfacial tension, comes solely from the latter contribution. The pressure anisotropy due to the intermolecular force between the fluid particles in the same or the different fluid components is approximately proportional to the multiplication of the corresponding fluid density gradients, and from the molecular dynamics simulation of the liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid interfaces, we demonstrate that the density gradient theory (DGT) by van der Waals gives the leading order approximation of the free energy density in inhomogeneous systems, neglecting the Tolman length.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Structural Study on the Growth History of Granular Heaps Prepared by the Raining Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular heaps are critical in both industrial applications and natural processes, exhibiting complex behaviors that have sparked significant research interest. The stress dip phenomenon observed beneath granular heaps continues to be a topic of significant debate. Current models based on force transmission often assume that the packing is near the isostatic point, overlooking the critical influence of internal structure and formation history on the mechanical properties of granular heaps. Consequently, these models fail to fully account for diverse observations. In this study, we experimentally explore the structural evolution of three dimensional (3D) granular heaps composed of monodisperse spherical particles prepared using the raining method. Our results reveal the presence of two distinct regions within the heaps, characterized by significant differences in structural properties such as packing fraction, contact number, and contact anisotropy. We attribute these structural variations to the differing formation mechanisms during heap growth. Our findings emphasize the substantial influence of the preparation protocols on the internal structure of granular heaps and provide valuable insights into stress distribution within granular materials. This research may contribute to the development of more accurate constitutive relations for granular materials by informing and refining future modeling approaches</description>

      <title>Long-ranged double-layer forces at high ionic strengths, with a modified Restricted Primitive Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments using the Surface Force Apparatus have found anomalously long-ranged interactions between charged surfaces in concentrated salt solutions. Meanwhile, theory and simulations have suggested ion clustering to be the possible origin of this behaviour. The popular Restricted Primitive Model of electrolyte solutions, in which the solvent is represented by a uniform relative dielectric screening factor, $\varepsilon_r$, is unable to resolve the anomalous underscreening observed in experiments. In this work, we modify the Restricted Primitive Model to account for local dielectric saturation within the ion hydration shell. The dielectric screening factor in our model locally decreases from the bulk value to a lower saturated value at the ionic surface. The parameters for the model are deduced so that typical salt solubilities are obtained. Our simulations for both bulk and slit geometries show that our model displays strong cluster formation and these give rise to long-ranged interactions between charged surfaces at distances similar to what has been observed in SFA measurements. An electrolyte model wherein the dielectric screening factor remains uniform does not display similar clusters, even with unreasonably low values of $\varepsilon_r$.</description>

      <title>Gellan-Based Hydrogels and Microgels for culturage heritage: a rheological perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gellan gum has gained significant attention due to its versatility in multiple applications in the form of hydrogels and microgels. A thorough understanding of the rheological behaviour of these systems is crucial both for fundamental research and to optimize the manufacturing needs. To this aim, here we extensively characterize the rheological behaviour of gellan based hydrogels and microgels recently used for efficient paper cleaning for restoration interventions. In particular, we study their viscoelastic properties, also during hydrogel and microgel formation, assessing the role of temperature, gellan concentration, and, importantly, the presence of different cations, which plays a crucial role in the gelation process. We find the interesting result that, in the conditions where they are efficient for cleaning, gellan hydrogels exhibit a double yielding behavior. In addition, we provide a detailed description of gellan microgels preparation, ensuring high control and reproducibility of the samples. Altogether our study sheds light on the mechanical stability, network structure, and overall functionality of the gellan-based gels, providing valuable insights into optimizing conditions for desired applications in paper cleaning.</description>

      <title>Dimensional confinement and superdiffusive rotational motion of uniaxial colloids in the presence of cylindrical obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biological system like cell the macromolecules which are anisotropic particles diffuse in a crowded medium. In the present work we have studied the diffusion of spheroidal particles diffusing between cylindrical obstacles by varying the density of the obstacles as well as the spheroidal particles. Analytical calculation of the free energy showed that the orientational vector of a single oblate particle will be aligned perpendicular and a prolate particle will be aligned parallel to the symmetry axis of the cylindrical obstacles in equilibrium. The nematic transition of the system with and without obstacle remained the same, but in the case of obstacles the nematic vector of the spheroid system always remained parallel to the cylindrical axis. The component of the translational diffusion coefficient of the spheroidal particle perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder is calculated for isotropic system which agrees with analytical calculation. When the cylinders overlap such that the spheroidal particles can only diffuse along the direction parallel to the axis of the cylinder we could observe dimensional confinement. This was observed by the discontinuous fall of the diffusion coefficient, when plotted against the chemical potential both for single particle as well as for finite volume fraction. The rotational diffusion coefficient quickly reached the bulk value as the distance between the obstacle increased in the isotropic phase. In the nematic phase the rotational motion of the spheroid should be arrested. We observed that even though the entire system remained in the nematic phase the oblate particle close to the cylinder underwent flipping motion. The consequence is that when the rotational mean squared displacement was calculated it showed a super-diffusive behavior even though the orientational self correlation function never relaxed to zero.</description>

      <title>The Liquid-Gas Transition in Granular Matter : a Question of Effective Friction ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comparative study of the best models available to describe granular fluids in order to investigate the extent to which it makes sense to speak about a liquid-gas transition in a system of particles that present no attractive interactions. It is shown that the gas and the liquid correspond to regimes with clearly distinct rheological responses. A microscopic interpretation of what happens at the transition in terms of the time scales relevant to the various physical processes is also presented and put the test against numerical data. Our work calls for more experiments to test our predictions on real systems.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent Conductivity of Concentrated Electrolytes: A Stochastic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of ionic solutions to time-varying electric fields, quantified by a frequency-dependent conductivity, is essential in many electrochemical applications. Yet, it constitutes a challenging problem due to the combined effect of Coulombic interactions, hydrodynamics, and thermal fluctuations. Here, we study the frequency-dependent conductivity of ionic solutions using a stochastic density functional theory. In the limit of small concentrations, we recover the classical Debye and Falkenhagen (DF) result, predicting an increase in conductivity with field frequency. At higher concentrations, we use a modified Coulomb interaction potential that accounts for the hard-core repulsion between the ions, which was recently employed in the zero-frequency case. Consequently, we extend the DF result to concentrated electrolytes. We discuss experimental and numerical studies and the complexity of observing the DF effect in such setups.</description>

      <title>Turbulent mixing controls fixation of growing antagonistic populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike coffee and cream that homogenize when stirred, growing micro-organisms (e.g., bacteria, baker's yeast) can actively kill each other and avoid mixing. How do such antagonistic interactions impact the growth and survival of competing strains, while being spatially advected by turbulent flows? By using numerical simulations of a continuum model, we study the dynamics of two antagonistic strains that are dispersed by incompressible turbulent flows in two spatial dimensions. A key parameter is the ratio of the fluid transport time to that of biological reproduction, which determines the winning strain that ultimately takes over the whole population from an initial heterogeneous state. By quantifying the probability and mean time for fixation along with the spatial structure of concentration fluctuations, we demonstrate how turbulence raises the threshold for biological nucleation and antagonism suppresses flow-induced mixing by depleting the population at interfaces. Our work highlights the unusual biological consequences of the interplay of turbulent fluid flows with antagonistic population dynamics, with potential implications for marine microbial ecology and origins of biological chirality.</description>
