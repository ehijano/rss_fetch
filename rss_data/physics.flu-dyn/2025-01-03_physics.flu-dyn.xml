      <title>Effects of Turbulence Modeling and Parcel Approach on Dispersed Two-Phase Swirling Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several numerical simulations of a co-axial particle-laden swirling air flow in a vertical circular pipe were performed. The air flow was modeled using the unsteady Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A Lagrangian model was used for the particle motion. The gas and particles are coupled through two-way momentum exchange. The results of the simulations using three versions of the k-epsilon turbulence model (standard, re-normalization group (RNG), and realizable) are compared with experimental mean velocity profiles. The standard model achieved the best overall performance. The realizable model was unable to satisfactorily predict the radial velocity; it is also the most computationally-expensive model. The simulations using the RNG model predicted additional recirculation zones. We also compared the particle and parcel approaches in solving the particle motion. In the latter, multiple similar particles are grouped in a single parcel, thereby reducing the amount of computation.</description>

      <title>Octree-Based Shifted Boundary Method for Multiphysics Simulations Using Linearized Navier-Stokes in Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the application of the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) to thermal flow simulations, utilizing incomplete octree meshes (Octree-SBM) to perform multiphysics simulations that couple flow and heat transfer. By employing a linearized form of the Navier-Stokes equations, we accelerate the simulations while maintaining accuracy. SBM enables precise enforcement of field and derivative boundary conditions on intercepted elements, allowing for accurate flux calculations near complex geometries, when using non-boundary fitted meshes. Both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are implemented within the SBM framework, with results demonstrating that SBM ensures precise enforcement of Neumann boundary conditions on octree-based meshes. We illustrate this approach by simulating flows across different regimes, benchmarking results over several orders of magnitude variation in Rayleigh numbers ($Ra \sim 10^3$ to $10^9$) and Reynolds numbers ($Re \sim 10^0$ to $10^4$), covering laminar, transitional, and turbulent regimes. Coupled thermal-flow phenomena as well as summary statistics across all these regimes are accurately captured without any additional numerical treatments, beyond a Residual-based Variational Multiscale formulation (RB-VMS). This approach offers a reliable and efficient solution for complex geometries, boundary conditions and flow regimes in computational multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>Metriplectic 4-bracket algorithm for constructing thermodynamically consistent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified thermodynamic algorithm (UTA) is presented for constructing thermodynamically consistent dynamical systems, i.e., systems that have Hamiltonian and dissipative parts that conserve energy while producing entropy. The algorithm is based on the metriplectic 4-bracket given in Morrison and Updike [Phys.\ Rev.\ E 109, 045202 (2024)]. A feature of the UTA is the force-flux relation $\mathbf{J}^\alpha = - L^{\alpha\beta}\, \nabla(\delta H / \delta \xi^\beta)$ for phenomenological coefficients $L^{\alpha\beta}$, Hamiltonian $H$ and dynamical variables $\xi^\beta$. The algorithm is applied to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier, the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes, and and Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems, and significant generalizations of these systems are obtained.</description>

      <title>An OpenFOAM face-centred solver for incompressible flows robust to mesh distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an overview of mesh-induced errors commonly experienced by cell-centred finite volumes (CCFV), for which the face-centred finite volume (FCFV) paradigm offers competitive solutions. In particular, a robust FCFV solver for incompressible laminar flows is integrated in OpenFOAM and tested on a set of steady-state and transient benchmarks. The method outperforms standard simpleFoam and pimpleFoam algorithms in terms of optimal convergence, accuracy, stability, and robustness. Special attention is devoted to motivate and numerically demonstrate the ability of the FCFV method to treat non-orthogonal, stretched, and skewed meshes, where CCFV schemes exhibit shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Finding the Underlying Viscoelastic Constitutive Equation via Universal Differential Equations and Differentiable Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research employs Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) alongside differentiable physics to model viscoelastic fluids, merging conventional differential equations, neural networks and numerical methods to reconstruct missing terms in constitutive models. This study focuses on analyzing four viscoelastic models: Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM), Johnson-Segalman, Giesekus, and Exponential Phan-Thien-Tanner (ePTT), through the use of synthetic datasets. The methodology was tested across different experimental conditions, including oscillatory and startup flows. While the UDE framework effectively predicts shear and normal stresses for most models, it demonstrates some limitations when applied to the ePTT model. The findings underscore the potential of UDEs in fluid mechanics while identifying critical areas for methodological improvement. Also, a model distillation approach was employed to extract simplified models from complex ones, emphasizing the versatility and robustness of UDEs in rheological modeling.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical equivariant graph neural networks for forecasting collective motion in vortex clusters and microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling of collective dynamics is a challenging problem because emergent phenomena in multi-agent systems are often shaped by long-range interactions among individuals. For example, in bird flocks and fish schools, long-range vision and flow coupling drive individual behaviors across the collective. Such collective motion can be modeled using graph neural networks (GNNs), but GNNs struggle when graphs become large and often fail to capture long-range interactions. Here, we construct hierarchical and equivariant GNNs, and show that these GNNs accurately predict local and global behavior in systems with collective motion. As representative examples, we apply this approach to simulations of clusters of point vortices and populations of microswimmers. For the point vortices, we define a local graph of vortices within a cluster and a global graph of interactions between clusters. For the microswimmers, we define a local graph around each microswimmer and a global graph that groups long-range interactions. We then combine this hierarchy of graphs with an approach that enforces equivariance to rotations and translations. This combination results in a significant improvement over a fully-connected GNN. For point vortices, our method conserves the Hamiltonian over long times, and, for microswimmers, our method predicts the transition from aggregation to swirling.</description>

      <title>Swimming mode determines how well mesoscale swimmers shield their odor in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine organisms manipulate their surrounding flow through their swimming dynamics, which affects the transport of their own odor cues. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations how a group of mesoscale swimmers immersed in a turbulent flow alters the shape of the odor plume they release in the water. Odor mixing is enhanced by increased velocity fluctuations and a swimmer-induced flow circulation which widen the odor plume at close range while speeding up dilution of the chemical trace. Beyond a short-range increase in the likelihood of being detected, swimming considerably reduces detections with effects that can persist at distances of the order of ten times the size of the group or more. We find that puller-like swimmers are more effective at olfactory shielding than pusher-like swimmers. We trace this difference back to the dynamics at the swimmer location, which tends to trap odor at the source for pushers and to dilute it for pullers. Olfactory shielding is robust to changes in the conditions, and is more pronounced for weak turbulent Reynolds numbers and large swimmer Reynolds numbers. Our results suggest that olfactory shielding may play a role in the emergence of different swimming modalities by marine organisms.</description>

      <title>Thread-safe multiphase lattice Boltzmann model for droplet and bubble dynamics at high density and viscosity contrasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a high-order, thread-safe version of the lattice Boltzmann (LBM) method, incorporating an interface-capturing equation, based on the conservative Allen-Cahn equation, to simulate incompressible two-component systems with high-density and viscosity contrasts. The method utilizes a recently proposed thread-safe implementation optimized for shared memory architectures and it is employed to reproduce the dynamics of droplets and bubbles on several test cases with results in agreement with experiments and other numerical simulations from the literature. The proposed approach offers promising opportunities for high-performance computing simulations of realistic fluid systems with high-density and viscosity contrasts for advanced applications in environmental, atmospheric and meteorological flows, all the way down to microfluidic and biological systems, particularly on GPU-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study of a Hybrid Solid Liquid Vibration Energy Harvester: Numerical Simulation &amp; Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have introduced and studied the feasibility of a hybrid solid liquid vibration energy harvester. The energy harvester consists of a ferrofluid partially filled in a tank and a piezoelectric beam fixed at one of the tank walls. The tank is assumed to be placed in a nonuniform magnetic field created by placing two powerful magnets symmetrically external to the tank walls. This magnetic field was then implemented by a Magnetic field function modeling the magnetic field produced by the two magnets. We used piezoelectric beam configurations and oscillation loads to study and characterize this 2D multiscale, multiphysics, and multiphase fluid structure interaction. The tank is subjected to an external oscillatory motion, which sloshes the ferrofluid and oscillates the beam utilizing two modes, one due to the beams inertia and the second due to the impact of the ferrofluid on the beam. The parameters varied in piezo materials, ferrofluid fill height, piezoelectric beam length, and oscillation frequency. The natural frequency modes for the piezoelectric beam are very important since the beam harvests the highest power in those modes. We have observed that when the fluid motion vibrates the beam, in some instances, the voltage output from piezoelectric material peaks to a high value, which is indicative of material nearing resonance frequencies at the fluid loading realized in those instances. However, in other cases, the voltage output varies with the loading, and hence, the response of the piezoelectric beam is broadband, very similar to the sloshing, which is inherently broadband.</description>

      <title>Transient rod-climbing in an Oldroyd-B fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weissenberg effect, or rod-climbing phenomenon, occurs in non-Newtonian fluids where the fluid interface ascends along a rotating rod. Despite its prominence, theoretical insights into this phenomenon remain limited. In earlier work, Joseph \&amp; Fosdick (\emph{Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal.}, vol. 49, 1973, pp. 321--380) employed domain perturbation methods for second-order fluids to determine the equilibrium interface height by expanding solutions based on the rotation speed. In this work, we investigate the time-dependent interface height through asymptotic analysis with dimensionless variables and equations using the Oldroyd-B model. We begin by neglecting surface tension and inertia to focus on the interaction between gravity and viscoelasticity. In the small-deformation scenario, the governing equations indicate the presence of a boundary layer in time, where the interface rises rapidly over a short time scale before gradually approaching a steady state. By employing a stretched time variable, we derive the transient velocity field and corresponding interface profile on this short time scale and recover the steady-state profile on a longer time scale. Subsequently, we reintroduce small but finite inertial effects to investigate their interplay with viscoelasticity and propose a criterion for determining the conditions under which rod-climbing occurs.</description>

      <title>The effect of turbulence, gravity, and non-continuum hydrodynamic interactions on the drop size distribution in clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of micron-sized droplets in clouds is studied with focus on the 'size-gap' regime of 15-40 $\mu m$ radius, where condensation and differential sedimentation are least effective in promoting growth. This bottleneck leads to inaccurate growth models and turbulence can potentially rectify disagreement with in-situ cloud measurements. The role of turbulent collisions, mixing of droplets, and water vapour fluctuations in crossing the 'size-gap' has been analysed in detail. Collisions driven by the coupled effects of turbulent shear and differential sedimentation are shown to grow drizzle sized droplets. Growth is also promoted by turbulence-induced water vapour fluctuations, which maintain polydispersity during the initial condensation driven growth and facilitate subsequent growth by differential sedimentation driven coalescence. The collision rate of droplets is strongly influenced by non-continuum hydrodynamics and so the size evolution beyond the condensation regime is found to be very sensitive to the mean free path of air. Turbulence-induced inertial clustering leads to a moderate enhancement in the growth rate but the intermittency of the turbulent shear rate does not change the coalescence rate significantly. The coupled influence of all these phenomena is evaluated by evolving a large number of droplets within an adiabatically rising parcel of air using a Monte Carlo scheme that captures turbulent intermittency and mixing.</description>

      <title>Computational fluid dynamics-based structure optimization of ultra-high-pressure water-jet nozzle using approximation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the geometry structure of ultra-high-pressure (UHP) water-jet nozzle is a critical factor to enhance its hydrodynamic performance, it is critical to obtain a suitable geometry for a UHP water jet nozzle. In this study, a CFD-based optimization loop for UHP nozzle structure has been developed by integrating an approximate model to optimize nozzle structure for increasing the radial peak wall shear stress. In order to improve the optimization accuracy of the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), an enhanced version called the Logistic-Tent chaotic sparrow search algorithm (LTC-SSA) is proposed. The LTC-SSA algorithm utilizes the Logistic-Tent Chaotic (LTC) map, which is designed by combining the Logistic and Tent maps. This new approach aims to overcome the shortcoming of "premature convergence" for the SSA algorithm by increasing the diversity of the sparrow population. In addition, to improve the prediction accuracy of peak wall shear stress, a data prediction method based on LTC-SSA-support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. Herein, LTC-SSA algorithm is used to train the penalty coefficient C and parameter gamma g of SVM model. In order to build LTC-SSA-SVM model, optimal Latin hypercube design (Opt LHD) is used to design the sampling nozzle structures, and the peak wall shear stress (objective function) of these nozzle structures are calculated by CFD method. For the purpose of this article, this optimization framework has been employed to optimize original nozzle structure. The results show that the optimization framework developed in this study can be used to optimize nozzle structure with significantly improved its hydrodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>Solving all laminar flows around airfoils all-at-once using a parametric neural network solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed increasing research interests of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving forward, inverse, and parametric problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their promise, PINNs still face significant challenges in many scenarios due to ill-conditioning. Time-stepping-oriented neural network (TSONN) addresses this by reformulating the ill-conditioned optimization problem into a series of well-conditioned sub-problems, greatly improving its ability to handle complex scenarios. This paper presents a new solver for laminar flow around airfoils based on TSONN and mesh transformation, validated across various test cases. Specifically, the solver achieves mean relative errors of approximately 3.6% for lift coefficients and 1.4% for drag coefficients. Furthermore, this paper extends the solver to parametric problems involving flow conditions and airfoil shapes, covering nearly all laminar flow scenarios in engineering. The shape parameter space is defined as the union of 30% perturbations applied to each airfoil in the UIUC airfoil database, with Reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 5000 and angles of attack spanning from -5{\deg} to 15{\deg}. The parametric solver solves all laminar flows within the parameter space in just 4.6 day, at approximately 40 times the computational cost of solving a single flow. The model training involves hundreds of millions of flow conditions and airfoil shapes, ultimately yielding a surrogate model with strong generalization capability that does not require labeled data. Specifically, the surrogate model achieves average errors of 4.6% for lift coefficients and 1.1% for drag coefficients, demonstrating its potential for high generalizability, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency in addressing high-dimensional parametric problems and surrogate modeling.</description>

      <title>Structure of an axisymmetric turbulent boundary layer under adverse pressure gradient: a large-eddy simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial characteristics and structure of an axisymmetric turbulent boundary layer under strong adverse pressure gradient and weak transverse curvature are investigated using incompressible large-eddy simulation. The boundary layer is on a $20^{\circ}$ tail cone of a body of revolution at a length-based Reynolds number of $1.9\times10^6$. The simulation results are in agreement with the experimental measurements of Balantrapu et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 929, 2021) and significantly expand the experimental results with new flow-field details and physical insights. The mean streamwise velocity profiles exhibit a shortened logarithmic region and a longer wake region compared with planar boundary layers at zero pressure gradient. With the embedded-shear-layer scaling, self-similarity is observed for the mean velocity and all three components of turbulence intensity. The azimuthal-wavenumber spectra of streamwise velocity fluctuations possess two peaks in the wall-normal direction, an inner peak at the wavelength of approximately 100 wall units and an outer peak in the wake region with growing strength, wavelength and distance to the wall in the downstream direction. Two-point correlations of streamwise velocity fluctuations show significant downstream growth and elongation of turbulence structures with increasing inclination angle. However, relative to the boundary-layer thickness, the correlation structures decrease in size in the downstream direction. The distributions of streamwise and wall-normal integral lengths across the boundary-layer thickness resemble those of zero-pressure-gradient planar boundary layers, whereas the azimuthal integral length deviates from the planar boundary-layer behavior at downstream stations.</description>

      <title>The reform of hydrodynamic Schr\"odinger equation and Lagrangian field theory for barotropic inviscid potential flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a reformed framework to address key issues in the existing hydrodynamic Schr\"odinger equation (HSE) framework. By disengaging the dependence on particle mass and introducing a correction term to eliminate quantum potential, the framework achieves better alignment with classical fluid mechanics. We define a new operator, designated as "specific Hamiltonian operator," which ensures that a reformed hydrodynamic Schr\"odinger equation (RHSE) is derivable from Lagrangian field theory. The RHSE for barotropic inviscid potential flow is developed and validated through Noether's theorem, demonstrating that the correction imposes the conservation of classical energy. While the resulting equations are highly nonlinear, this approach offers an effective pathway for bridging quantum mechanics and classical fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Finite difference physics-informed neural networks enable improved solution accuracy of the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating an accurate solution of the Navier--Stokes equations using physics--informed neural networks (PINNs) for higher Reynolds numbers in the corners of a lid--driven cavity problem is challenging. In this paper, we improve the solution accuracy of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the region near the walls significantly and generate accurate secondary vortices in the corners of the lid--driven cavity by solving the governing equations using finite difference--based PINNs (FD--PINNs) without employing the known solution. We adopt the domain decomposition method (DDM) and combine it with the FD--PINNs to solve the lid--driven cavity problem for the Reynolds numbers Re = 400 and Re=1000. A comparison of the mean square error (MSE) between the presented and standard FD--PINNs using the reference solution is exhibited, showing the accuracy and effectiveness of the new approach.</description>

      <title>Executing a Successful Third Shot Drop in Pickleball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and investigate a successful third shot drop in pickleball using a numerical model of pickleball ball aerodynamics. Our overall objective is to investigate the ranges of initial speeds, angles and spins that result in a successful third shot drop. We conclude that the initial speed must be in the range $10.9~ms^{-1}$ to $13~ms^{-1}$ for down-the-line shots and $13.3~ ms^{-1}$ to $16~ms^{-1}$ for cross-court shots. The initial angle must be in the range $15.5$ degrees to $22.5$ degrees for down-the-line shots and $12.5$ degrees to $18$ degrees for cross-court shots. We conclude that the effects of spin on the third shot drop are of secondary importance. We believe these results could be useful as a guide to coaches and players wanting to develop this crucial aspect of the game of pickleball.</description>

      <title>A Novel Velocity Discretization for Lattice Boltzmann Method: Application to Compressible Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has emerged as a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics and material science. However, standard LBM formulation imposes some limitations on the applications of the method, particularly compressible fluids. In this paper, we introduce a new velocity discretization method to overcome some of these challenges. In this new formulation, the particle populations are discretized using a bump function that has a mean and a variance. This introduces enough independent degrees of freedom to set the equilibrium moments to the moments of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution up to and including the third moments. Consequently, the correct macroscopic fluid dynamics equations for compressible fluids are recovered. We validate our method using several benchmark simulations.</description>

      <title>Extracting Interaction Kernels for Many-Particle Systems by a Two-Phase Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-phase method for learning interaction kernels of stochastic many-particle systems. After transforming stochastic trajectories of every particle into the particle density function by the kernel density estimation method, the first phase of our approach combines importance sampling with an adaptive threshold strategy to identify key terms in the kernel function, while the second phase uses the whole dataset to refine the coefficients. During the implementation of our method, the mean-field equation plays a key role in reformulating the task of extracting the interaction kernels into a learnable regression problem. We demonstrate the outstanding performance of our approach through extensive numerical examples, including interacting particle systems with a cubic potential, power-law repulsion-attraction potential, piecewise linear potential, as well as a two-dimensional radially symmetric potential.</description>

      <title>Close-contact melting on hydrophobic textured surfaces: Confinement and meniscus effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of close-contact melting (CCM) on gas-trapped hydrophobic surfaces, with specific focus on the effects of geometrical confinement and the liquid-air meniscus below the liquid film. By employing dual-series and perturbation methods, we obtain numerical solutions for the effective slip lengths associated with velocity $\lambda$ and temperature $\lambda_t$ fields, across various values of aspect ratio $\Lambda$ (defined as the ratio of the film thickness $h$ to the structure's periodic length $l$) and gas-liquid fraction $\phi$. Asymptotic solutions of $\lambda$ and $\lambda_t$ for $\Lambda\ll 1$ and $\Lambda \gg 1$ are derived and summarized for different surface structures, interface shapes and $\Lambda$, which reveal a different trend for $\lambda$ and $\Lambda \ll 1$ and the presence of a meniscus. In the context of constant-pressure CCM, our results indicate that transverse-grooves surfaces consistently reduced the heat transfer. However, longitudinal grooves can enhance heat transfer under the effects of confinement and meniscus when $\Lambda \lessapprox 0.1$ and $\phi &lt; 1 - 0.5^{2/3} \approx 0.37$. For gravity-driven CCM, the parameters of $l$ and $\phi$ determine whether the melting rate is enhanced, reduced, or nearly unaffected. We construct a phase diagram based on the parameter matrix $(\log_{10} l, \phi)$to delineate these three regimes. Lastly, we derived two asymptotic solutions for predicting the variation in time of the unmelted solid height.</description>

      <title>The coherent structure of the energy cascade in isotropic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy cascade, i.e. the transfer of kinetic energy from large-scale to small-scale flow motions, has been the cornerstone of turbulence theories and models since the 1940s. However, understanding the spatial organization of the energy transfer has remained elusive. In this work, we answer the question: What are the characteristic flow patterns surrounding regions of intense energy transfer? To that end, we utilize numerical data of isotropic turbulence to investigate the three-dimensional spatial structure of the energy cascade in the inertial range. Our findings indicate that forward energy-transfer events are predominantly confined in the high strain-rate region created between two distinct zones of elevated enstrophy. On average, these zones manifest in the form of two hairpin-like shapes with opposing orientations. The mean velocity field associated with the energy transfer exhibits a saddle point topology when observed in the frame of reference local to the event. The analysis also shows that the primary driving mechanism for the cascade involves strain-rate self-amplification, which is responsible for 85% of the energy transfer, whereas vortex stretching accounts for less than 15%.</description>

Abstract: A machine-learning strategy for investigating the stability of fluid flow problems is proposed herein. The objective is to exploit shallow neural networks for a binary classification task to distinguish between bifurcated and non-bifurcated states. The goal is to provide a simple yet robust methodology to find a nonlinear mapping from the parametric space to a bifurcating indicator identifying the region of interest.The computational procedure is demonstrably robust and does not require parameter tuning. The essential feature of the strategy is that the computational solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is a reliable proxy for laboratory experiments investigating sensitivity to flow parameters. The applicability of our bifurcation detection strategy is demonstrated by an investigation of two classical examples of flow instability associated with thermal convection. The codes used to generate and process the labelled data are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Mixing in viscoelastic fluids using elastic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of elastic turbulence on mixing of a scalar concentration field within a viscoelastic fluid in a two-dimensional Taylor-Couette geometry using numerical solutions of the Oldroyd-B model. The flow state is determined through the secondary-flow order parameter indicating the regime of elastic turbulence. When starting in the turbulent state and subsequently lowering the Weissenberg number, a weakly-chaotic flow occurs below $\mathrm{Wi_c}$. Advection in both the turbulent and weakly-chaotic flow states induces mixing, which we illustrate by the time evolution of the standard deviation of the solute concentration from the uniform distribution. In particular, in the elastic turbulent state mixing is strong and we quantify it by the mixing rate, the mixing time, and the mixing efficiency. All three quantities follow scaling laws. Importantly, we show that the order parameter is strongly correlated to the mixing rate and hence is also a good indication of mixing within the fluid.</description>

      <title>A buoyancy-drag model with a time-varying drag coefficient for evaluating bubble front penetration depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To evaluate and control bubble front penetration depth ${{h}_{B}}$ induced by ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability (ARTI) from a weakly nonlinear phase to a self-similar phase, we first propose an improved buoyancy-drag (BD) model with a time-varying drag coefficient. The coefficient incorporates the influence of multiple physical mechanisms, including non-steady ablation, preheating, and other mechanisms during this phase. The model is validated through simulations under various conditions, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to the classical BD model and the self-similar growth. Furthermore, the model suggests controlling ${{h}_{B}}$ by suppressing the "most dangerous mode", which is influenced by initial perturbations and ablative acceleration history, thus offering novel insights for target manufacturing and pulse optimization near the ignition threshold.</description>

      <title>HOPE: An Automatically Differentiable High-Order Non-Oscillatory Finite-Volume Shallow-Water Dynamic Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An automatically differentiable, high-order non-oscillatory finite volume shallow water dynamic core has been constructed on a cubed sphere grid. This dynamic core has four advantageous properties: high order accuracy, essential non-oscillation, mass conservation, and scalability. Besides, the code development is based on PyTorch, enabling the model to run seamlessly on both CPU and GPU, while naturally possessing the capability of automatic differentiation. We named the new dynamic core as High Order Prediction Environment (HOPE). The spatial reconstruction is based on the two-dimensional tensor product polynomial (TPP) and the genuine two-dimensional Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory scheme. A novel panel boundary approach ensures that the accuracy can reach arbitrary order. These algorithms have very high degree of compatibility with GPU architecture, allowing the computational overhead to be mitigated through the utilization of GPU. The Low Mach number Approximate Riemann Solver scheme is adopted as Riemann solvers to determine fluxes on the Gaussian points on edges. Flux across the interface between each cell edge is computed using Gaussian quadrature, and the tendencies of prognostic variables are obtained by integration all the source terms and the fluxes across the cell boundaries. This shallow water dynamic core exhibits outstanding performance in ideal shallow water test cases. In the steady-state geostrophic flow, the 11th order scheme reduces errors to nearly double precision round-off error even on coarse grids. Furthermore, HOPE maintains the Rossby-Haurwitz wave over 100 days without collapse. To test the non-oscillation property, we designed a cylinder dam break case, the WENO approach effectively suppresses non-physical oscillation, and the genuine two-dimensional reconstruction exhibits significantly better isotropy than the dimension-by-dimension scheme.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow channeling and mass transport with discontinuous porosity distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flow of fluids within porous rocks is an important process with numerous applications in Earth sciences. Modeling the compaction-driven fluid flow requires the solution of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that account for the fluid flow and the solid deformation within the porous medium. Despite the nonlinear relation of porosity and permeability that is commonly encountered, natural data show evidence of channelized fluid flow in rocks that have an overall layered structure. Layers of different rock types routinely have discontinuous hydraulic and mechanical properties. We present numerical results obtained by a novel space-time method which can handle discontinuous initial porosity (and permeability) distributions. The space-time method enables a straightforward coupling to models of mass transport for trace elements. Our results show the influence of different kinds of layering in the development of fluid-rich channels and mass transport.</description>
