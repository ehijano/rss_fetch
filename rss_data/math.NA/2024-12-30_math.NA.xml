      <title>Variational Bayesian Inference for Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis (TRPCA) holds a crucial position in machine learning and computer vision. It aims to recover underlying low-rank structures and characterizing the sparse structures of noise. Current approaches often encounter difficulties in accurately capturing the low-rank properties of tensors and balancing the trade-off between low-rank and sparse components, especially in a mixed-noise scenario. To address these challenges, we introduce a Bayesian framework for TRPCA, which integrates a low-rank tensor nuclear norm prior and a generalized sparsity-inducing prior. By embedding the proposed priors within the Bayesian framework, our method can automatically determine the optimal tensor nuclear norm and achieve a balance between the nuclear norm and sparse components. Furthermore, our method can be efficiently extended to the weighted tensor nuclear norm model. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based model order reduction of fluid-structure interaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce optimization-based full-order and reduced-order formulations of fluid structure interaction problems. We study the flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid which interacts with an elastic body: we consider an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation of the fluid problem and a fully Lagrangian formulation of the solid problem; we rely on a finite element discretization of both fluid and solid equations. The distinctive feature of our approach is an implicit coupling of fluid and structural problems that relies on the solution to a constrained optimization problem with equality constraints. We discuss the application of projection-based model reduction to both fluid and solid subproblems: we rely on Galerkin projection for the solid equations and on least-square Petrov-Galerkin projection for the fluid equations. Numerical results for three model problems illustrate the many features of the formulation.</description>

      <title>Tensor Density Estimator by Convolution-Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-dimensional density estimation problems, most classical distance metrics between probability distributions suffer from the exponential growth of variance with respect to the dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a novel distance metric that avoids this curse of dimensionality based on a specifically chosen kernel. By matching the empirical density in terms of this metric, a low-rank tensor-train representation can be computed with a complexity that is linear in both sample size and dimensionality. It consists of three simple steps: convolving the empirical distribution with the kernel; compressing the empirical distribution after convolution as a tensor train, with efficient tensor decomposition algorithms; and finally, applying a deconvolution to such a tensor-train representation. Numerical results demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Spherical Authalic Energy Minimization for Area-Preserving Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new effective method called spherical authalic energy minimization (SAEM) for computing spherical area-preserving parameterizations of genus-zero surfaces. The proposed SAEM has solid theoretical support and guaranteed convergence. In addition, we develop a Riemannian bijective correction method to ensure the bijectivity of the produced mapping under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments showed that the SAEM effectively minimized area distortion with improved bijectivity compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Travelling wave solutions of an equation of Harry Dym type arising in the Black-Scholes framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Black-Scholes framework is crucial in pricing a vast number of financial instruments that permeate the complex dynamics of world markets. Associated with this framework, we consider a second-order differential operator $L(x, {\partial_x}) := v^2(x,t) (\partial_x^2 -\partial_x)$ that carries a variable volatility term $v(x,t)$ and which is dependent on the underlying log-price $x$ and a time parameter $t$ motivated by the celebrated Dupire local volatility model. In this context, we ask and answer the question of whether one can find a non-linear evolution equation derived from a zero-curvature condition for a time-dependent deformation of the operator $L$. The result is a variant of the Harry Dym equation for which we can then find a family of travelling wave solutions. This brings in extensive machinery from soliton theory and integrable systems. As a by-product, it opens up the way to the use of coherent structures in financial-market volatility studies.</description>

      <title>A Novel Algorithm for Periodic Conformal Flattening of Genus-one and Multiply Connected Genus-zero Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for genus-one and multiply connected genus-zero surfaces, namely periodic conformal flattening.The primary advantage of this method is its independence from the cut paths and consistency preservation of the cut seams, which introduce no additional conformal distortion near the cut seams.We utilize the conformal energy minimization technique to compute the desired conformal map, which is characterised as an easy-solved quadratic functional minimization problem.The numerical experiments illustrate that our proposed algorithms DPCF and SPCF is of high accuracy and a 4-5 times improvement in terms of efficiency compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>An efficient cell-centered nodal integral method for multi-dimensional Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient coarse-mesh nodal integral method (NIM), based on cell-centered variables and referred to as cell-centered NIM (CCNIM), is developed and applied for solving multi-dimensional, time-dependent, Burgers equations. Unlike traditional NIM, which utilizes surface-averaged variables as discrete unknowns, this innovative approach formulates the final expression of the numerical scheme using discrete unknowns represented by cell-centered or node-averaged variables. By relying on these cell centroids, the proposed CCNIM approach presents several advantages compared to traditional NIM. These include a simplified implementation process in terms of local coordinate systems, enhanced flexibility regarding the higher order of accuracy in time, straightforward formulation for higher-degree temporal derivatives, and offering a viable option for coupling with other physics. The multidimensional time-dependent Burgers' problems with known analytical solutions are solved in order to validate the developed scheme. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the proposed CCNIM approach and other traditional NIM schemes is conducted to showcase its effectiveness. The simplicity and robustness of the approach provide a strong foundation for its seamless extension to more complex fluid flow problems.</description>

      <title>A robust $C^0$ interior penalty method for a gradient-elastic Kirchhoff plate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to proposing and analyzing a robust $C^0$ interior penalty method for a gradient-elastic Kirchhoff plate (GEKP) model over a convex polygon. The numerical method is obtained by combining the triangular Hermite element and a $C^0$ interior penalty method, which can avoid the use of higher order shape functions or macroelements. Next, a robust regularity estimate is established for the GEKP model based on our earlier result for a triharmonic equation on a convex polygon. Furthermore, some local lower bound estimates of the a posteriori error analysis are established. These together with an enriching operator and its error estimates lead to a C\'{e}a-like lemma. Thereby, the optimal error estimates are achieved, which are also robust with respect to the small size parameter. In addition, it is proved that this numerical method is convergent without any additional regularity assumption for the exact solution. Some numerical experiments are performed to verify the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weak well-posedness of a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) whose drift is density-dependent and whose diffusion is constant. The existence part is due to H\"older stability estimates of the associated Euler-Maruyama scheme. The uniqueness part is due to that of the associated Fokker-Planck equation. We also obtain convergence rate in weighted $L^1$ norm for the Euler-Maruyama scheme.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of PM-BDF2 method for quasiperiodic parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerically solving parabolic equations with quasiperiodic coefficients is a significant challenge due to the potential formation of space-filling quasiperiodic structures that lack translational symmetry or decay. In this paper, we introduce a highly accurate numerical method for solving time-dependent quasiperiodic parabolic equations. We discretize the spatial variables using the projection method (PM) and the time variable with the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2). We provide a complexity analysis for the resulting PM-BDF2 method. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed convergence analysis, demonstrating that the proposed method exhibits spectral accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time. Numerical results in both one and two dimensions validate these convergence results, highlighting the PM-BDF2 method as a highly efficient algorithm for addressing quasiperiodic parabolic equations.</description>

      <title>Overlapping Schwarz Preconditioners for Randomized Neural Networks with Domain Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized neural networks (RaNNs), in which hidden layers remain fixed after random initialization, provide an efficient alternative for parameter optimization compared to fully parameterized networks. In this paper, RaNNs are integrated with overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition in two (main) ways: first, to formulate the least-squares problem with localized basis functions, and second, to construct overlapping preconditioners for the resulting linear systems. In particular, neural networks are initialized randomly in each subdomain based on a uniform distribution and linked through a partition of unity, forming a global solution that approximates the solution of the partial differential equation. Boundary conditions are enforced through a constraining operator, eliminating the need for a penalty term to handle them. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the number of basis functions in each subdomain, yielding a linear system with a lower condition number. By constructing additive and restricted additive Schwarz preconditioners, the least-squares problem is solved efficiently using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) and Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) methods, respectively. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational time for multi-scale and time-dependent problems. Additionally, a three-dimensional problem is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of using the CG method with an AS preconditioner, compared to an QR decomposition, in solving the least-squares problem.</description>

      <title>Are Two Hidden Layers Still Enough for the Physics-Informed Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article discusses the development of various methods and techniques for initializing and training neural networks with a single hidden layer, as well as training a separable physics-informed neural network consisting of neural networks with a single hidden layer to solve physical problems described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). A method for strictly deterministic initialization of a neural network with one hidden layer for solving physical problems described by an ODE is proposed. Modifications to existing methods for weighting the loss function are given, as well as new methods developed for training strictly deterministic-initialized neural networks to solve ODEs (detaching, additional weighting based on the second derivative, predicted solution-based weighting, relative residuals). An algorithm for physics-informed data-driven initialization of a neural network with one hidden layer is proposed. A neural network with pronounced generalizing properties is presented, whose generalizing abilities of which can be precisely controlled by adjusting network parameters. A metric for measuring the generalization of such neural network has been introduced. A gradient-free neuron-by-neuron fitting method has been developed for adjusting the parameters of a single-hidden-layer neural network, which does not require the use of an optimizer or solver for its implementation. The proposed methods have been extended to 2D problems using the separable physics-informed neural networks approach. Numerous experiments have been carried out to develop the above methods and approaches. Experiments on physical problems, such as solving various ODEs and PDEs, have demonstrated that these methods for initializing and training neural networks with one or two hidden layers (SPINN) achieve competitive accuracy and, in some cases, state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Variational integrators for stochastic Hamiltonian systems on Lie groups: properties and convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive variational integrators for stochastic Hamiltonian systems on Lie groups using a discrete version of the stochastic Hamiltonian phase space principle. The structure-preserving properties of the resulting scheme, such as symplecticity, preservation of the Lie-Poisson structure, preservation of the coadjoint orbits, and conservation of Casimir functions, are discussed, along with a discrete Noether theorem for subgroup symmetries. We also consider in detail the case of stochastic Hamiltonian systems with advected quantities, studying the associated structure-preserving properties in relation to semidirect product Lie groups. A full convergence proof for the scheme is provided for the case of the Lie group of rotations. Several numerical examples are presented, including simulations of the free rigid body and the heavy top.</description>

      <title>A reduced-order framework for temperature estimation in food freezing from optimally located sensors, including turbulent conjugate flow scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a framework for estimating temperature fields in food-freezing applications that significantly reduces computational load while ensuring accurate temperature monitoring, representing a promising technological tool for optimizing and controlling food engineering processes. The strategy is based on (i) a mathematical model of a convection-dominated problem coupling thermal convection and turbulence and (ii) a least-squares approach for solving the inverse data assimilation problem, regularized by projecting the governing dynamics onto a reduced-order model (ROM). The unsteady freezing process considers an idealized salmon slice in a freezer cabinet, modeled with temperature-dependent thermophysical properties. The forward problem is approximated using a third-order WENO finite volume solver, including an optimized second-order backward scheme for time discretization. We employ our data assimilation framework to reconstruct the temperature field from a limited number of sensor data and to estimate temperature distributions within frozen food. Sensor placement is optimized using a new greedy algorithm, relying on maximizing the observability of the reduced-order dynamics for a fixed set of sensors. The proposed approach allows efficient extrapolation from external sensor measurements to the internal temperature of the food, which is crucial for maintaining food quality.</description>

      <title>An arbitrary order mixed finite element method with boundary value correction for the Darcy flow on curved domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a boundary value correction method for the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini mixed finite element discretization of the Darcy flow with non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition on 2D curved domains. The discretization is defined on a body-fitted triangular mesh, i.e. the boundary nodes of the mesh lie on the curved physical boundary. However, the boundary edges of the triangular mesh, which are straight, may not coincide with the curved physical boundary. A boundary value correction technique is then designed to transform the Neumann boundary condition from the physical boundary to the boundary of the triangular mesh. One advantage of the boundary value correction method is that it avoids using curved mesh elements and thus reduces the complexity of implementation. We prove that the proposed method reaches optimal convergence for arbitrary order discretizations. Supporting numerical results are presented. Key words: mixed finite element method, Neumann boundary condition, curved domain, boundary value correction method.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses two significant drawbacks of an eddy viscosity turbulence model: the issue of excessive dissipation relative to energy input and the lack of a universal parameter specification. Considering the Baldwin-Lomax model with backscatter effects, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions under mild conditions. Our next result shows that this model maintains energy dissipation rates consistent with energy input, thereby avoiding over-dissipation and aligning with K41 phenomenology. Additionally, we propose a range for the model's parameters.</description>

      <title>Block cross-interactive residual smoothing for Lanczos-type solvers for linear systems with multiple right-hand sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanczos-type solvers for large sparse linear systems often exhibit large oscillations in the residual norms. In finite precision arithmetic, large oscillations increase the residual gap (the difference between the recursively updated residual and the explicitly computed residual) and a loss of attainable accuracy of the approximations. This issue is addressed using cross-interactive residual smoothing (CIRS). This approach improves convergence behavior and reduces the residual gap. Similar to how the standard Lanczos-type solvers have been extended to global and block versions for solving systems with multiple right-hand sides, CIRS can also be extended to these versions. While we have developed a global CIRS scheme (Gl-CIRS) in our previous study [K. Aihara, A. Imakura, and K. Morikuni, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 43 (2022), pp.1308--1330], in this study, we propose a block version (Bl-CIRS). Subsequently, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Bl-CIRS from various perspectives, such as theoretical insights into the convergence behaviors of the residual and approximation norms, numerical experiments on model problems, and a detailed rounding error analysis for the residual gap. For Bl-CIRS, orthonormalizing the columns of direction matrices is crucial in effectively reducing the residual gap. This analysis also complements our previous study and evaluates the residual gap of the block Lanczos-type solvers.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy Score Function and Score-Based Particle Algorithm for Nonlinear L\'{e}vy--Fokker--Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The score function for the diffusion process, also known as the gradient of the log-density, is a basic concept to characterize the probability flow with important applications in the score-based diffusion generative modelling and the simulation of It\^{o} stochastic differential equations. However, neither the probability flow nor the corresponding score function for the diffusion-jump process are known. This paper delivers mathematical derivation, numerical algorithm, and error analysis focusing on the corresponding score function in non-Gaussian systems with jumps and discontinuities represented by the nonlinear L\'{e}vy--Fokker--Planck equations. We propose the L\'{e}vy score function for such stochastic equations, which features a nonlocal double-integral term, and we develop its training algorithm by minimizing the proposed loss function from samples. Based on the equivalence of the probability flow with deterministic dynamics, we develop a self-consistent score-based transport particle algorithm to sample the interactive L\'{e}vy stochastic process at discrete time grid points. We provide error bound for the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the numerical and true probability density functions by overcoming the nonlocal challenges in the L\'{e}vy score. The full error analysis with the Monte Carlo error and the time discretization error is furthermore established. To show the usefulness and efficiency of our approach, numerical examples from applications in biology and finance are tested.</description>

      <title>Error estimate based adaptive quadrature for layer potentials over axisymmetric surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layer potentials represent solutions to partial differential equations in an integral equation formulation. When numerically evaluating layer potentials at evaluation points close to the domain boundary, specialized quadrature techniques are required for accuracy because of rapid variations in the integrand. To efficiently achieve a specified error tolerance, we introduce an adaptive quadrature method with automatic parameter adjustment for axisymmetric surfaces, facilitated by error estimation. Notably, while each surface must be axisymmetric, the integrand itself need not be, allowing for applications with complex geometries featuring multiple axisymmetric bodies.
  The proposed quadrature method utilizes so-called interpolatory semi-analytical quadrature in conjunction with a singularity swap technique in the azimuthal angle. In the polar angle, such a technique is used as needed, depending on the integral kernel, combined with an adaptive subdivision of the integration interval. The method is tied to a regular quadrature method that employs a trapezoidal rule in the azimuthal angle and a Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule in the polar angle, which will be used whenever deemed sufficiently accurate, as determined by a quadrature error estimate [C. Sorgentone and A.-K. Tornberg, Advances in Computational Mathematics, 49 (2023), p. 87].
  Error estimates for both numerical integration and interpolation are derived using complex analysis, and are used to determine the adaptive panel subdivision given the evaluation point and desired accuracy. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the method's efficacy.</description>

      <title>A coupled mathematical and numerical model for protein spreading and tissue atrophy, applied to Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce, analyse and test in practice a new mathematical model describing the interplay between biological tissue atrophy driven by pathogen diffusion, with applications to neurodegenerative disorders. This study introduces a novel mathematical and computational model comprising a Fisher-Kolmogorov equation for species diffusion coupled with an elasticity equation governing mass loss. These equations intertwine through a logistic law dictating the reduction of the medium's mass. One potential application of this model lies in understanding the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease. Here, the equations can describe the propagation of misfolded tau-proteins and the ensuing brain atrophy characteristic of the disease. To address numerically the inherited complexities, we propose a Polygonal Discontinuous Galerkin method on polygonal/polyhedral grids for spatial discretization, while time integration relies on the theta-method. We present the mathematical model, delving into its characteristics and propose discretization applied. Furthermore, convergence results are presented to validate the model, accompanied by simulations illustrating the application scenario of the onset of Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>Exploring low-rank structure for an inverse scattering problem with far-field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse scattering problem exhibits an inherent low-rank structure due to its ill-posed nature; however developing low-rank structures for the inverse scattering problem remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a novel low-rank structure tailored for solving the inverse scattering problem. The particular low-rank structure is given by the generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions, computed stably and accurately via a Sturm-Liouville problem. We first process the far-field data to obtain a post-processed data set within a disk domain. Subsequently, the post-processed data are projected onto a low-rank space given by the low-rank structure. The unknown is approximately solved in this low-rank space, by dropping higher-order terms. The low-rank structure leads to a H\"{o}lder-logarithmic type stability estimate for arbitrary unknown functions, and a Lipschitz stability estimate for unknowns belonging to a finite dimensional low-rank space. Various numerical experiments are conducted to validate its performance, encompassing assessments of resolution capability, robustness against randomly added noise and modeling errors, and demonstration of increasing stability.</description>

      <title>Local Characteristic Decomposition of Equilibrium Variables for Hyperbolic Systems of Balance Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with high-order numerical methods for hyperbolic systems of balance laws. Such methods are typically based on high-order piecewise polynomial reconstructions (interpolations) of the computed discrete quantities. However, such reconstructions (interpolations) may be oscillatory unless the reconstruction (interpolation) procedure is applied to the local characteristic variables via the local characteristic decomposition (LCD). Another challenge in designing accurate and stable high-order schemes is related to enforcing a delicate balance between the fluxes, sources, and nonconservative product terms: a good scheme should be well-balanced (WB) in the sense that it should be capable of exactly preserving certain (physically relevant) steady states. One of the ways to ensure that the reconstruction (interpolation) preserves these steady states is to apply the reconstruction (interpolation) to the equilibrium variables, which are supposed to be constant at the steady states. To achieve this goal and to keep the reconstruction (interpolation) non-oscillatory, we introduce a new LCD of equilibrium variables. We apply the developed technique to the fifth-order Ai-WENO-Z interpolation implemented within the WB A-WENO framework recently introduced in [S. Chu, A. Kurganov, and R. Xin, Beijing J. of Pure and Appl. Math., to appear], and illustrate its performance on a variety of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Computational Assessment of Turbulent Eddy Impact on Hydrodynamic Mixing in a Stirred Tank Bioreactor with Vent based Impellers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogeneity and efficient oxygen transfer are crucial for aerobic cultures, which is popularly performed in Stirred Tank Bioreactors, through internal mechanical agitation of the impellers.Although there are a number of impeller designs for achieving this purpose, there are still concerns about the ability of the impellers to yield homogeneity and mitigate or eliminate stagnant zones.In this study, a novel impeller design, with auxiliary agitators in form of vents, was introduced and evaluated for small lab-scale bioreactors. For the evaluation, 3D models of a single and double impeller configurations, placed in two different bioreactors were developed. Computational fluid dynamics was employed to carry out the hydrodynamic simulation using k-epsilon standard model in the bioreactors.Computational variables such as the flow velocity, streamlines, pressure and wall shear stress on the shaft and impellers, eddy viscosity, turbulence eddy dissipation and turbulence kinetic energy were obtained and compared in both bioreactors to evaluate the performances at speeds of 50, 100, and 150 revolutions per minute.A comparison of the results with traditional segment-segment and segment-Rushton impellers shows that our double impeller configuration performs more desirably at speeds ranging from 100 to 150 RPM. Homogeneity was also achieved in both bioreactors, and there was significant reduction of stagnant zone less than 99 percentage in the double impeller configuration and significant mitigation in the single impeller agitation.</description>

      <title>ERGNN: Spectral Graph Neural Network with Explicitly-optimized Rational Graph Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximation-based spectral graph neural networks, which construct graph filters with function approximation, have shown substantial performance in graph learning tasks. Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the theoretical and practical foundations of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative models, which leverage stochastic processes and Brownian motion to model complex data distributions. These models employ forward and reverse diffusion processes defined through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to iteratively add and remove noise, enabling high-quality data generation. By analyzing the performance bounds of these models, we demonstrate how score estimation errors propagate through the reverse process and bound the total variation distance using discrete Girsanov transformations, Pinsker's inequality, and the data processing inequality (DPI) for an information theoretic lens.</description>

      <title>Mixed-precision numerics in scientific applications: survey and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads has led to a significant increase in silicon area dedicated to lower-precision computations on recent high-performance computing hardware designs. However, mixed-precision capabilities, which can achieve performance improvements of 8x compared to double-precision in extreme compute-intensive workloads, remain largely untapped in most scientific applications. A growing number of efforts have shown that mixed-precision algorithmic innovations can deliver superior performance without sacrificing accuracy. These developments should prompt computational scientists to seriously consider whether their scientific modeling and simulation applications could benefit from the acceleration offered by new hardware and mixed-precision algorithms. In this article, we review the literature on relevant applications, existing mixed-precision algorithms, theories, and the available software infrastructure. We then offer our perspective and recommendations on the potential of mixed-precision algorithms to enhance the performance of scientific simulation applications. Broadly, we find that mixed-precision methods can have a large impact on computational science in terms of time-to-solution and energy consumption. This is true not only for a few arithmetic-dominated applications but also, to a more moderate extent, to the many memory bandwidth-bound applications. In many cases, though, the choice of algorithms and regions of applicability will be domain-specific, and thus require input from domain experts. It is helpful to identify cross-cutting computational motifs and their mixed-precision algorithms in this regard. Finally, there are new algorithms being developed to utilize AI hardware and and AI methods to accelerate first-principles computational science, and these should be closely watched as hardware platforms evolve.</description>

      <title>Sparse recovery from quadratic equations, part II: hardness and incoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the square root bottleneck in the recovery of sparse vectors from quadratic equations. It is acknowledged that a sparse vector $ \mathbf x_0\in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\| \mathbf x_0\|_0 = k$ can in theory be recovered from as few as $O(k)$ generic quadratic equations but no polynomial time algorithm is known for this task unless $m = \Omega(k^2)$. This bottleneck was in fact shown in previous work to be essentially related to the initialization of descent algorithms. Starting such algorithms sufficiently close to the planted signal is known to imply convergence to this signal. In this paper, we show that as soon as $m\gtrsim \mu_0^{-2}k \vee \mu_0^{-4}$ (up to log factors) where $\mu_0 = \| \mathbf x_0\|_\infty/\| \mathbf x_0\|_2$, it is possible to recover a $k$-sparse vector $ \mathbf x_0\in \mathbb{R}^n$ from $m$ quadratic equations of the form $\langle \mathbf A_i, \mathbf x \mathbf x^\intercal\rangle = \langle \mathbf A_i, \mathbf x_0 \mathbf x_0^\intercal\rangle + \varepsilon_i $ by minimizing the classical empirical loss. The proof idea carries over to the phase retrieval setting for which it provides an original initialization that matches the current optimal sample complexity (see e.g. [Cai 2023]). In the maximally incoherent regime $\mu_0^{-2}=k$, and for $m=o(k^2)$ we provide evidence for topological hardness by showing that a property known as the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), which originated in spin glass theory and is conjectured to be indicative of algorithmic intractability when optimizing over random structures, holds for a particular level of overparametrization. The key ingredient of the proof is a lower bound on the tail of chi-squared random variables which follows from the theory of moderate deviations.</description>

      <title>Estimation of System Parameters Including Repeated Cross-Sectional Data through Emulator-Informed Deep Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential equations (DEs) are crucial for modeling the evolution of natural or engineered systems. Traditionally, the parameters in DEs are adjusted to fit data from system observations. However, in fields such as politics, economics, and biology, available data are often independently collected at distinct time points from different subjects (i.e., repeated cross-sectional (RCS) data). Conventional optimization techniques struggle to accurately estimate DE parameters when RCS data exhibit various heterogeneities, leading to a significant loss of information. To address this issue, we propose a new estimation method called the emulator-informed deep-generative model (EIDGM), designed to handle RCS data. Specifically, EIDGM integrates a physics-informed neural network-based emulator that immediately generates DE solutions and a Wasserstein generative adversarial network-based parameter generator that can effectively mimic the RCS data. We evaluated EIDGM on exponential growth, logistic population models, and the Lorenz system, demonstrating its superior ability to accurately capture parameter distributions. Additionally, we applied EIDGM to an experimental dataset of Amyloid beta 40 and beta 42, successfully capturing diverse parameter distribution shapes. This shows that EIDGM can be applied to model a wide range of systems and extended to uncover the operating principles of systems based on limited data.</description>

      <title>Numerical inverse scattering transform for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with box-type initial conditions on a nonzero background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to solve numerically the Cauchy problem for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with a box-type initial condition (IC) having a nontrivial background of amplitude $q_o&gt;0$ as $x\to \pm \infty$ by implementing numerically the associated Inverse Scattering Transform (IST). The Riemann--Hilbert problem associated to the inverse transform is solved numerically by means of appropriate contour deformations in the complex plane following the numerical implementation of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method. In this work, the box parameters are chosen so that there is no discrete spectrum (i.e., no solitons). In particular, the numerical method is demonstrated to be accurate within the two asymptotic regimes corresponding to two different regions of the $(x,t)$-plane depending on whether $|x/(2t)| &lt; q_o$ or $|x/(2t)| &gt; q_o$, as $t \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Entropy stable non-oscillatory fluxes: An optimized wedding of entropy conservative flux with non-oscillatory flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.07088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work frames the problem of constructing non-oscillatory entropy stable fluxes as a least square optimization problem. A flux sign stability condition is defined for a pair of entropy conservative flux ($F^*$) and a non-oscillatory flux ($F^s$). This novel approach paves a way to construct non-oscillatory entropy stable flux ($\hat{F}$) as a simple combination of $(F^*$ and $F^s)$ which inherently optimize the numerical diffusion in the entropy stable flux ($\hat{F}$) such that it reduces to the underlying non-oscillatory flux ($F^s$) in the flux sign stable region. This robust approach is (i) agnostic to the choice of flux pair $(F^*,F^s)$, (ii) does not require the computation of costly dissipation operator and high order reconstruction of scaled entropy variable to construct the diffusion term. Various non-oscillatory entropy stable fluxes are constructed and exhaustive computational results for standard test problems are given which show that these entropy stable schemes completely remove spurious oscillations in approximating the discontinuities compared to the non-oscillatory schemes using underlying fluxes ($F^s$) only. Moreover, these entropy stable schemes maintain the formal order of accuracy of the lower order flux in the pair.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence rates for a full discretization of stochastic wave equation with nonlinear damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper establishes the strong convergence rates of a spatio-temporal full discretization of the stochastic wave equation with nonlinear damping in dimension one and two. We discretize the SPDE by applying a spectral Galerkin method in space and a modified implicit exponential Euler scheme in time. The presence of the super-linearly growing damping in the underlying model brings challenges into the error analysis. To address these difficulties, we first achieve upper mean-square error bounds, and then obtain mean-square convergence rates of the considered numerical solution. This is done without requiring the moment bounds of the full approximations. The main result shows that, in dimension one, the scheme admits a convergence rate of order $\tfrac12$ in space and order $1$ in time. In dimension two, the error analysis is more subtle and can be done at the expense of an order reduction due to an infinitesimal factor. Numerical experiments are performed and confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Maximal Volume Matrix Cross Approximation for Image Compression and Least Squares Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classic matrix cross approximation based on the maximal volume submatrices. Our main results consist of an improvement of the classic estimate for matrix cross approximation and a greedy approach for finding the maximal volume submatrices. More precisely, we present a new proof of the classic estimate of the inequality with an improved constant. Also, we present a family of greedy maximal volume algorithms to improve the computational efficiency of matrix cross approximation. The proposed algorithms are shown to have theoretical guarantees of convergence. Finally, we present two applications: image compression and the least squares approximation of continuous functions. Our numerical results at the end of the paper demonstrate the effective performance of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating unknown parameters in stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which we model as a sequence of Gaussian stationary processes with decreasing correlation time. We aim to infer parameters in the limit equation, driven by white noise, given observations of the colored noise dynamics. We consider both the maximum likelihood and the stochastic gradient descent in continuous time estimators, and we propose to modify them by including filtered data. We provide a convergence analysis for our estimators showing their asymptotic unbiasedness in a general setting and asymptotic normality under a simplified scenario.</description>

      <title>Blow-up Whitney forms, shadow forms, and Poisson processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Whitney forms on a simplex $T$ admit high-order generalizations that have received a great deal of attention in numerical analysis. Less well-known are the shadow forms of Brasselet, Goresky, and MacPherson. These forms generalize the Whitney forms, but have rational coefficients, allowing singularities near the faces of $T$. Motivated by numerical problems that exhibit these kinds of singularities, we introduce degrees of freedom for the shadow $k$-forms that are well-suited for finite element implementations. In particular, we show that the degrees of freedom for the shadow forms are given by integration over the $k$-dimensional faces of the blow-up $\tilde T$ of the simplex $T$. Consequently, we obtain an isomorphism between the cohomology of the complex of shadow forms and the cellular cohomology of $\tilde T$, which vanishes except in degree zero. Additionally, we discover a surprising probabilistic interpretation of shadow forms in terms of Poisson processes. This perspective simplifies several proofs and gives a way of computing bases for the shadow forms using a straightforward combinatorial calculation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of constructing approximations based on orthogonal polynomials that preserve an arbitrary set of moments of a given function without loosing the spectral convergence property. To this aim, we compute the constrained polynomial of best approximation for a generic basis of orthogonal polynomials. The construction is entirely general and allows us to derive structure preserving numerical methods for partial differential equations that require the conservation of some moments of the solution, typically representing relevant physical quantities of the problem. These properties are essential to capture with high accuracy the long-time behavior of the solution. We illustrate with the aid of several numerical applications to Fokker-Planck equations the generality and the performances of the present approach.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for the Riemannian logarithm on the Stiefel manifold for a family of Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the popularization of the Stiefel manifold for numerical applications in 1998 in a seminal paper from Edelman et al., it has been exhibited to be a key to solve many problems from optimization, statistics and machine learning. In 2021, H\"uper et al. proposed a one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics on the Stiefel manifold, subsuming the well-known Euclidean and canonical metrics. Since then, several methods have been proposed to obtain a candidate for the Riemannian logarithm given any metric from the family. Most of these methods are based on the shooting method or rely on optimization approaches. For the canonical metric, Zimmermann proposed in 2017 a particularly efficient method based on a pure matrix-algebraic approach. In this paper, we derive a generalization of this algorithm that works for the one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics. The algorithm is proposed in two versions, termed backward and forward, for which we prove that it conserves the local linear convergence previously exhibited in Zimmermann's algorithm for the canonical metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extended framework for hybrid finite element approximations of self-adjoint, positive definite operators. It covers the cases of primal, mixed, and ultraweak formulations, both at the continuous and discrete levels, and gives rise to conforming discretizations. Our framework allows for flexible continuity restrictions across elements, and includes the extreme cases of conforming and discontinuous hybrid methods. We illustrate an application of the framework to the Kirchhoff-Love plate pending model and present three primal hybrid and two mixed hybrid methods, four of them with numerical examples. In particular, we present conforming frameworks for (in classical meaning) non-conforming elements of Morley, Zienkiewicz triangular, and Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson types.</description>

      <title>STLCutters.jl: A scalable geometrical framework library for unfitted finite element discretisations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating partial differential equations for extensive industrial and scientific applications requires leveraging the power of modern high-performance computing. In large-scale parallel computations, the geometrical discretisation rapidly becomes a bottleneck in the simulation pipeline. Unstructured mesh generation is hardly automatic, and meshing algorithms cannot efficiently exploit distributed-memory computers. Adaptive Cartesian meshes are far more advantageous, providing cheap and scalable mesh generation, partitioning, and balancing compared to unstructured meshes. However, Cartesian meshes are not suitable for complex geometries when using standard discretisation techniques. Unfitted finite element methods are a promising solution to the abovementioned problems. Nevertheless, their application is usually constrained to implicit (level set) geometrical representations. The extension to general geometries, e.g., provided by an STL surface mesh, requires advanced intersection algorithms. This work presents an efficient parallel implementation of all the geometric tools required, e.g., for unfitted finite element methods (in a broad sense), for explicit boundary representations. Such geometries can readily be generated using standard computer-aided design tools. The proposed geometrical workflow utilise a multilevel approach to overlapping computations, effectively eliminating bottlenecks in large-scale computations. The numerical results demonstrate perfect weak scalability over 13,000 processors and one billion cells. All these algorithms are implemented in the open-sopurce STLCutters.jl library, written in the Julia programming language. The library is designed to be used in conjunction with the Gridap.jl library provides a high-level interface to the finite element method.</description>

      <title>A Natural Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Adversarial Neural Network Training on Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scalable preconditioned primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). We multiply the PDE with a dual test function to obtain an inf-sup problem whose loss functional involves lower-order differential operators. The Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm is then leveraged for this saddle point problem. By introducing suitable precondition operators to the proximal steps in the PDHG algorithm, we obtain an alternative natural gradient ascent-descent optimization scheme for updating the neural network parameters. We apply the Krylov subspace method (MINRES) to evaluate the natural gradients efficiently. Such treatment readily handles the inversion of precondition matrices via matrix-vector multiplication. A posterior convergence analysis is established for the time-continuous version of the proposed method. The algorithm is tested on various types of PDEs with dimensions ranging from $1$ to $50$, including linear and nonlinear elliptic equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Monge-Amp\`ere equations stemming from the $L^2$ optimal transport problems. We compare the performance of the proposed method with several commonly used deep learning algorithms such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the DeepRitz method, weak adversarial networks (WANs), etc, for solving PDEs using the Adam and L-BFGS optimizers. The numerical results suggest that the proposed method performs efficiently and robustly and converges more stably.</description>

      <title>Determining superconvergence points for $L2-1_\sigma$ scheme of variable-exponent subdiffusion and error estimate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $L2-1_\sigma$ scheme for subdiffusion of variable exponent. In existing works, determining the superconvergence points requires solving a nonlinear equation related to the variable exponent at each time step. This work relaxes the selection criterion of superconvergence points without affecting the numerical accuracy, which may reduce the cost of determining superconvergence points. Then we prove error estimates for the $L2-1_\sigma$ scheme of variable-exponent subdiffusion.
  Numerical results are performed to substantiate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of a subclass of exponential integrators, specifically explicit exponential Runge--Kutta methods. It is well known that third-order methods can suffer from order reduction when applied to linearized problems involving unbounded and non-commuting operators. In this work, we consider a fourth-stage third-order Runge--Kutta method, which successfully achieves the expected order of accuracy and avoids order reduction, as long as all required order conditions are satisfied. The convergence analysis is carried out under the assumption of higher regularity for the initial data. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an energy stable network (EStable-Net) for solving gradient flow equations. The EStable-Net enables decreasing of a discrete energy along the neural network, which is consistent with the property of the gradient flow equation. The architecture of the neural network EStable-Net is based on the block network structure (Autoflow) in which output of each block can be interpreted as an intermediate state of the evolution process of the equation, and the energy stable property is incorporated in each block, which is easily generalized to include other physical and/or numerical properties. Our EStable-Net is a supervised learning network approach for solving evolution equations which does not depend on the convergence of time step goes to 0, and can be applied generally even when only data is available but the equation is unknown. We also propose a training strategy for supervised learning that employs data of the evolution stages with different nature. The EStable-Net is validated by numerical experimental results based on the Allen-Cahn equation and the Cahn-Hilliard equation in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>The semi-analytic theory and computation of finite-depth standing water waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Stokes expansion ansatz for finite-depth standing water waves in two dimensions and devise a recursive algorithm to compute the expansion coefficients. We implement the algorithm on a supercomputer using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The Stokes expansion introduces hyperbolic terms that require exponentiation of power series, which we handle efficiently using Bell polynomials. Although exact resonances occur at a countable dense set of fluid depths, we prove that for almost every depth, the divisors that arise in the recurrence are bounded away from zero by a slowly decaying function of the wave number. A direct connection between small divisors and imperfect bifurcations is observed. They are found to activate secondary standing waves that oscillate non-uniformly in space and time on top of the primary wave, with different amplitudes and phases on each bifurcation branch. We compute new families of standing waves using a shooting method and find that Pad\'e approximants of the Stokes expansion continue to converge to the shooting method solutions at large amplitudes as new small divisors enter the recurrence. Closely spaced poles and zeros of the Pad\'e approximants are observed that suggest that the bifurcation branches are separated by branch cuts.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral based particle initialization algorithm for Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for initializing particle distribution in SPH simulations are important for improving simulation accuracy. However, no such algorithms exist for boundary integral SPH models, which can model complex geometries without requiring layers of virtual particles. This study introduces the Boundary Integral based Particle Initialization (BIPI) algorithm. It employs a particle packing algorithm meticulously designed to redistribute particles to fit the geometry boundary. The BIPI algorithm directly utilizes the geometry's boundary information using the SPH boundary integral formulation. Special consideration is given to particles adjacent to the boundary to prevent artificial volume compression. The BIPI algorithm can hence generate a particle distribution with reduced concentration gradients for domains with complex geometrical shapes. Finally, several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, including the application of the BIPI algorithm in flow problems.</description>
