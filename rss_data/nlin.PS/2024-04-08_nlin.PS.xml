      <title>Comment on "Non-reciprocal topological solitons in active metamaterials"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent work "Non-reciprocal topological solitons in active metamaterials" (see arXiv:2312.03544v1), for an analytical understanding of the system under consideration, the authors derive an ordinary differential equation for the sine-Gordon (anti)soliton velocity, with the perturbation theory in the adiabatic approximation, via the inverse scattering transform formalism, see Eq. (3) in their work. Here we note that the latter equation for the (anti)soliton velocity also follows from an energy balance approach.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Modulation Instability with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulation instability is a phenomenon of spontaneous pattern formation in nonlinear media, oftentimes leading to an unpredictable behaviour and a degradation of a signal of interest. We propose an approach based on reinforcement learning to suppress the unstable modes by optimizing the parameters for the time modulation of the potential in the nonlinear system. We test our approach in 1D and 2D cases and propose a new class of physically-meaningful reward functions to guarantee tamed instability.</description>

      <title>Hidden order in dielectrics: string condensation, solitons, and the charge-vortex duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Description of electrons as solitons of the polarization field implies that an ordinary dielectric has a hidden order, associated with the invariance with respect to adding loops of quantized electric flux. We describe the mechanism by which the finite polarizability of the medium renders the interaction between the solitons short-ranged (prior to their coupling to electromagnetism) and argue that the structure of the solitons allows them to be quantized as either fermions or bosons. At the quantum level, the theory has, in addition to the solitonic electric, elementary magnetic excitations, suggesting that small dielectrics may host quantized magnetic vortices carrying circular polarization currents.</description>

      <title>Vortex ring beams in nonlinear $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a two-dimensional photonic array featuring a circular shape and an alternating gain and loss pattern. Our analysis revolves around determining the presence and resilience of optical ring modes with varying vorticity values. This investigation is conducted with respect to both the array's length and the strength of the non-Hermitian parameter. For larger values of array's length, we observe a reduction in the stability domain as the non-Hermitian parameter increases. Interestingly, upon an increasing of vorticity of the optical modes full stability windows emerge for shorter lattice sizes regime.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Reduction to Temporally Aperiodic Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of spectral submanifolds (SSMs) to general non-autonomous dynamical systems that are either weakly forced or slowly varying. Examples of such systems arise in structural dynamics, fluid-structure interactions and control problems. The time-dependent SSMs we construct under these assumptions are normally hyperbolic and hence will persist for larger forcing and faster time dependence that are beyond the reach of our precise existence theory. For this reason, we also derive formal asymptotic expansions that, under explicitly verifiable nonresonance conditions, approximate SSMs and their aperiodic anchor trajectories accurately for stronger, faster or even temporally discontinuous forcing. Reducing the dynamical system to these persisting SSMs provides a mathematically justified model reduction technique for non-autonomous physical systems whose time dependance is moderate either in magnitude or speed. We illustrate the existence, persistence and computation of temporally aperiodic SSMs in mechanical examples under chaotic forcing.</description>

      <title>Dispersive shock waves in a one-dimensional droplet-bearing environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the controllable generation of distinct types of dispersive shock-waves emerging in a quantum droplet bearing environment with the aid of step-like initial conditions. Dispersive regularization of the ensuing hydrodynamic singularities occurs due to the competition between meanfield repulsion and attractive quantum fluctuations. This interplay delineates the dominance of defocusing (hyperbolic) and focusing (elliptic) hydrodynamic phenomena respectively being designated by real and imaginary speed of sound. Specifically, the symmetries of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii model lead to a three-parameter family, encompassing two densities and a relative velocity, of the underlying Riemann problem utilized herein. Surprisingly, dispersive shock waves persist across the hyperbolic-to-elliptic threshold, while a plethora of additional wave patterns arise, such as rarefaction waves, traveling dispersive shock waves, (anti)kinks and droplet wavetrains. The classification and characterization of these features is achieved by deploying Whitham modulation theory. Our results pave the way for unveiling a multitude of unexplored coherently propagating waveforms in such attractively interacting mixtures and should be detectable by current experiments.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation by turbulent cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully developed turbulence is a universal and scale-invariant chaotic state characterized by an energy cascade from large to small scales where the cascade is eventually arrested by dissipation. In this article, we show how to harness these seemingly structureless turbulent cascades to generate patterns. Pattern formation entails a process of wavelength selection, which can usually be traced to the linear instability of a homogeneous state. By contrast, the mechanism we propose here is fully non-linear. It is triggered by a non-dissipative arrest of turbulent cascades: energy piles up at an intermediate scale, which is neither the system size nor the smallest scales at which energy is usually dissipated. Using a combination of theory and large-scale simulations, we show that the tunable wavelength of these cascade-induced patterns can be set by a non-dissipative transport coefficient called odd viscosity, ubiquitous in chiral fluids ranging from bio-active to quantum systems. Odd viscosity, which acts as a scale-dependent Coriolis-like force, leads to a two-dimensionalization of the flow at small scales, in contrast with rotating fluids where a two-dimensionalization occurs at large scales. Beyond odd-viscosity fluids, we discuss how cascade-induced patterns can arise in natural systems including atmospheric flows, stellar plasma such as the solar wind~, or the pulverization and coagulation of objects or droplets where mass rather than energy cascades.</description>
