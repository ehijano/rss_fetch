      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Multi-coding with Non-orthogonal Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though orthogonal multi-code signaling and its derivative, simplex signaling, are well known and widely used in different communication systems, certain applications may choose to adopt non-orthogonal signaling to benefit from other advantages that such signaling methods can offer. Motivated by a class of multi-carrier spread spectrum systems, this paper presents a thorough symbol error rate analysis of the broad class of multi-code signaling methods when they make use of codes which are not necessarily orthogonal. Our analysis is also extended to the case where the code set includes the negative of each code vector, i.e., an extension to biorthogonal signaling. Moreover, it is shown that the symbol error rate results derived in this paper reduce to those available in the literature when the multi-codes are orthogonal or satisfy the correlation property of simplex multi-codes.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Decoding of Classical Coset Codes over $3-$User Quantum Interference Channel : New Achievable Rate Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a Shannon theoretic study of the problem of communicating classical information over a $3-$user quantum interference channel (QIC) and focus on characterizing inner bounds. In our previous work, we had demonstrated that coding strategies based on coset codes can yield strictly larger inner bounds. Adopting the powerful technique of \textit{tilting}, \textit{smoothing} and \textit{augmentation} discovered by Sen recently, and combining with our coset code strategy we derive a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of a $3-$user QIC. The derived inner bound subsumes all current known bounds.</description>

      <title>Online Conformal Compression for Zero-Delay Communication with Distortion Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a lossy source compression problem in which both the encoder and decoder are equipped with a pre-trained sequence predictor. We propose an online lossy compression scheme that, under a 0-1 loss distortion function, ensures a deterministic, per-sequence upper bound on the distortion (outage) level for any time instant. The outage guarantees apply irrespective of any assumption on the distribution of the sequences to be encoded or on the quality of the predictor at the encoder and decoder. The proposed method, referred to as online conformal compression (OCC), is built upon online conformal prediction--a novel method for constructing confidence intervals for arbitrary predictors. Numerical results show that OCC achieves a compression rate comparable to that of an idealized scheme in which the encoder, with hindsight, selects the optimal subset of symbols to describe to the decoder, while satisfying the overall outage constraint.</description>

      <title>MinGRU-Based Encoder for Turbo Autoencoder Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early neural channel coding approaches leveraged dense neural networks with one-hot encodings to design adaptive encoder-decoder pairs, improving block error rate (BLER) and automating the design process. However, these methods struggled with scalability as the size of message sets and block lengths increased. TurboAE addressed this challenge by focusing on bit-sequence inputs rather than symbol-level representations, transforming the scalability issue associated with large message sets into a sequence modeling problem. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were a natural fit for sequence processing, their reliance on sequential computations made them computationally expensive and inefficient for long sequences. As a result, TurboAE adopted convolutional network blocks, which were faster to train and more scalable, but lacked the sequential modeling advantages of RNNs. Recent advances in efficient RNN architectures, such as minGRU and minLSTM, and structured state space models (SSMs) like S4 and S6, overcome these limitations by significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. These models enable scalable sequence processing, making RNNs competitive for long-sequence tasks. In this work, we revisit RNNs for Turbo autoencoders by integrating the lightweight minGRU model with a Mamba block from SSMs into a parallel Turbo autoencoder framework. Our results demonstrate that this hybrid design matches the performance of convolutional network-based Turbo autoencoder approaches for short sequences while significantly improving scalability and training efficiency for long block lengths. This highlights the potential of efficient RNNs in advancing neural channel coding for long-sequence scenarios.</description>

      <title>LoS Blockage in Pinching-Antenna Systems: Curse or Blessing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter is to investigate the impact of line-of-sight (LoS) blockage on pinching-antenna systems. Analytical results are developed for both single-user and multi-user cases to reveal that the presence of LoS blockage is beneficial for increasing the performance gain of pinching antennas over conventional antennas. This letter also reveals that LoS blockage is particularly useful in multi-user cases, where co-channel interference can be effectively suppressed by LoS blockage.</description>

      <title>Can Non-Signaling Assistance Increase the Degrees of Freedom of a Wireless Network?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open question recently posed by Fawzi and Ferme [Transactions on Information Theory 2024], asks whether non-signaling (NS) assistance can increase the capacity of a general broadcast channel (BC). We answer this question in the affirmative, by showing that for a certain K-receiver BC model, called Coordinated Multipoint broadcast (CoMP BC) that arises naturally in wireless networks, NS-assistance provides multiplicative gains in both capacity and degrees of freedom (DoF), even achieving K-fold improvements in some cases. In a CoMP BC, B single-antenna transmitters, supported by a backhaul that allows them to share data, act as one B-antenna transmitter, to send independent messages to K receivers, each equipped with a single receive antenna. A fixed and globally known connectivity matrix M, specifies for each transmit antenna, the subset of receivers that are connected to (have a non-zero channel coefficient to) that antenna. Besides the connectivity, there is no channel state information at the transmitter. The DoF region is fully characterized for a class of connectivity patterns associated with tree graphs. Sum-capacity with NS-assistance for arbitrary connectivity patterns is shown to be bounded below and above by the triangle number and the min-rank of the connectivity matrix, respectively. While translations to Gaussian settings are demonstrated, for simplicity most of our results are presented under noise-free, finite-field (Fq) models. Converse proofs for classical DoF are found by adapting the Aligned Images bounds to the finite field model. Converse bounds for NS-assisted capacity extend the same-marginals property to the BC with NS-assistance available to all parties. Beyond the BC setting, even stronger (unbounded) gains in capacity due to NS assistance are established for certain 'communication with side-information' settings, such as the fading dirty paper channel.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Co-Design of Communication, Computing, and Control for Edge-Enabled Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a task-oriented co-design framework that integrates communication, computing, and control to address the key challenges of bandwidth limitations, noise interference, and latency in mission-critical industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To improve communication efficiency and robustness, we design a task-oriented Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) using Information Bottleneck (IB) to enhance data transmission efficiency by prioritizing task-specific information. To mitigate the perceived End-to-End (E2E) delays, we develop a Delay-Aware Trajectory-Guided Control Prediction (DTCP) strategy that integrates trajectory planning with control prediction, predicting commands based on E2E delay. Moreover, the DTCP is co-designed with task-oriented JSCC, focusing on transmitting task-specific information for timely and reliable autonomous driving. Experimental results in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that, under an E2E delay of 1 second (20 time slots), the proposed framework achieves a driving score of 48.12, which is 31.59 points higher than using Better Portable Graphics (BPG) while reducing bandwidth usage by 99.19%.</description>

      <title>TwinTURBO: Semi-Supervised Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models via Mutual Information Decompositions for Downstream Task and Latent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a semi-supervised fine-tuning framework for foundation models that utilises mutual information decomposition to address the challenges of training for a limited amount of labelled data. Our approach derives two distinct lower bounds: i) for the downstream task space, such as classification, optimised using conditional and marginal cross-entropy alongside Kullback-Leibler divergence, and ii) for the latent space representation, regularised and aligned using a contrastive-like decomposition. This fine-tuning strategy retains the pre-trained structure of the foundation model, modifying only a specialised projector module comprising a small transformer and a token aggregation technique. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks under extremely low-labelled conditions by effectively leveraging unlabelled data.</description>

      <title>Cost-Aware Optimal Pairwise Pure Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure exploration is one of the fundamental problems in multi-armed bandits (MAB). However, existing works mostly focus on specific pure exploration tasks, without a holistic view of the general pure exploration problem. This work fills this gap by introducing a versatile framework to study pure exploration, with a focus on identifying the pairwise relationships between targeted arm pairs. Moreover, unlike existing works that only optimize the stopping time (i.e., sample complexity), this work considers that arms are associated with potentially different costs and targets at optimizing the cumulative cost that occurred during learning. Under the general framework of pairwise pure exploration with arm-specific costs, a performance lower bound is derived. Then, a novel algorithm, termed CAET (Cost-Aware Pairwise Exploration Task), is proposed. CAET builds on the track-and-stop principle with a novel design to handle the arm-specific costs, which can potentially be zero and thus represent a very challenging case. Theoretical analyses prove that the performance of CAET approaches the lower bound asymptotically. Special cases are further discussed, including an extension to regret minimization, which is another major focus of MAB. The effectiveness and efficiency of CAET are also verified through experimental results under various settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Routing Optimization Using Coherent Ising Machine in Wireless Multihop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization in wireless communication networks is a challenging task, particularly for large-scale and diverse topologies. Recent advances in quantum computing offer promising solutions for such problems. Coherent Ising Machines (CIM), a quantum-inspired algorithm, leverages the quantum properties of coherent light, enabling faster convergence to the ground state. This paper applies CIM to multi-objective routing optimization in wireless multi-hop networks. We formulate the routing problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and map it onto an Ising model, allowing CIM to solve it. CIM demonstrates strong scalability across diverse network topologies without requiring topology-specific adjustments, overcoming the limitations of traditional quantum algorithms like Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our results show that CIM provides feasible and near-optimal solutions for networks containing hundreds of nodes and thousands of edges. Additionally, a complexity analysis highlights CIM's increasing efficiency as network size grows</description>

      <title>How Does CP Length Affect the Sensing Range for OFDM-ISAC?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which has been the dominating waveform for contemporary wireless communications, is also regarded as a competitive candidate for future integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Existing works on OFDM-ISAC usually assume that the maximum sensing range should be limited by the cyclic prefix (CP) length since inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) should be avoided. However, in this paper, we provide rigorous analysis to reveal that the random data embedded in OFDM-ISAC signal can actually act as a free ``mask" for ISI, which makes ISI/ICI random and hence greatly attenuated after radar signal processing. The derived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the range profile demonstrates that the maximum sensing range of OFDM-ISAC can greatly exceed the ISI-free distance that is limited by the CP length, which is validated by simulation results. To further mitigate power degradation for long-range targets, a novel sliding window sensing method is proposed, which iteratively detects and cancels short-range targets before shifting the detection window. The shifted detection window can effectively compensate the power degradation due to insufficient CP length for long-range targets. Such results provide valuable guidance for the CP length design in OFDM-ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Secret-Key Generation from Private Identifiers under Channel Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates secret-key generation for device authentication using physical identifiers, such as responses from physical unclonable functions (PUFs). The system includes two legitimate terminals (encoder and decoder) and an eavesdropper (Eve), each with access to different measurements of the identifier. From the device identifier, the encoder generates a secret key, which is securely stored in a private database, along with helper data that is saved in a public database accessible by the decoder for key reconstruction. Eve, who also has access to the public database, may use both her own measurements and the helper data to attempt to estimate the secret key and identifier. Our setup focuses on authentication scenarios where channel statistics are uncertain, with the involved parties employing multiple antennas to enhance signal reception. Our contributions include deriving inner and outer bounds on the optimal trade-off among secret-key, storage, and privacy-leakage rates for general discrete sources, and showing that these bounds are tight for Gaussian sources.</description>

      <title>Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces for Enhancing MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) show great potential for improving the wireless network capacity in an energy-efficient manner. An FIM is a soft array consisting of several low-cost radiating elements. Each element can independently emit electromagnetic signals, while flexibly adjusting its position even perpendicularly to the overall surface to `morph' its 3D shape. More explicitly, compared to a conventional rigid antenna array, an FIM is capable of finding an optimal 3D surface shape that provides improved signal quality. In this paper, we study point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications between a pair of FIMs. In order to characterize the capacity limits of FIM-aided MIMO transmissions over frequency-flat fading channels, we formulate a transmit optimization problem for maximizing the MIMO channel capacity by jointly optimizing the 3D surface shapes of the transmitting and receiving FIMs as well as the MIMO transmit covariance matrix, subject to the total transmit power constraint and to the maximum perpendicular morphing range of the FIM. To solve this problem, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm. The BCD algorithm iteratively updates the 3D surface shapes of the FIMs and the transmit covariance matrix, while keeping the other fixed, to find a locally optimal solution. Numerical results verify that FIMs can achieve higher MIMO capacity than that of the conventional rigid arrays. In particular, the MIMO channel capacity can be doubled by the proposed BCD algorithm under some setups.</description>

      <title>Perfect Recovery for Random Geometric Graph Matching with Shallow Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the graph matching problem in the presence of vertex feature information using shallow graph neural networks. Specifically, given two graphs that are independent perturbations of a single random geometric graph with sparse binary features, the task is to recover an unknown one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the two graphs. We show under certain conditions on the sparsity and noise level of the feature vectors, a carefully designed two-layer graph neural network can, with high probability, recover the correct mapping between the vertices with the help of the graph structure. Additionally, we prove that our condition on the noise parameter is tight up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we compare the performance of the graph neural network to directly solving an assignment problem using the noisy vertex features and demonstrate that when the noise level is at least constant, this direct matching fails to achieve perfect recovery, whereas the graph neural network can tolerate noise levels growing as fast as a power of the size of the graph. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical studies as well as real-world data experiments.</description>

      <title>Conditional Dependence via U-Statistics Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of measuring conditional dependence between two random phenomena arises when a third one (a confounder) has a potential influence on the amount of information between them. A typical issue in this challenging problem is the inversion of ill-conditioned autocorrelation matrices. This paper presents a novel measure of conditional dependence based on the use of incomplete unbiased statistics of degree two, which allows to re-interpret independence as uncorrelatedness on a finite-dimensional feature space. This formulation enables to prune data according to observations of the confounder itself, thus avoiding matrix inversions altogether. The proposed approach is articulated as an extension of the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion, which becomes expressible through kernels that operate on 4-tuples of data.</description>

      <title>A Transfer Framework for Enhancing Temporal Graph Learning in Data-Scarce Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic interactions between entities are prevalent in domains like social platforms, financial systems, healthcare, and e-commerce. These interactions can be effectively represented as time-evolving graphs, where predicting future connections is a key task in applications such as recommendation systems. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved strong results for such predictive tasks but typically require extensive training data, which is often limited in real-world scenarios. One approach to mitigating data scarcity is leveraging pre-trained models from related datasets. However, direct knowledge transfer between TGNNs is challenging due to their reliance on node-specific memory structures, making them inherently difficult to adapt across datasets.
  To address this, we introduce a novel transfer approach that disentangles node representations from their associated features through a structured bipartite encoding mechanism. This decoupling enables more effective transfer of memory components and other learned inductive patterns from one dataset to another. Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances TGNN performance in low-data regimes, outperforming non-transfer baselines by up to 56\% and surpassing existing transfer strategies by 36\%</description>
