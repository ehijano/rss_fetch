      <title>Calculi of epistemic grounding based on Prawitz's theory of grounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a class of formal systems inspired by Prawitz's theory of grounds. The latter is a semantics that aims at accounting for epistemic grounding, namely, at explaining why and how deductively valid inferences have the power to epistemically compel to accept the conclusion. Validity is defined in terms of typed objects, called grounds, that reify evidence for given judgments. An inference is valid when a function exists from grounds for the premises to grounds for the conclusion. Grounds are described by formal terms, either directly when the terms are in canonical form, or indirectly when they are in non-canonical form. Non-canonical terms must reduce to canonical form, and two terms may be said to be equal when they converge towards equivalent grounds. In our systems these properties can be proved through rules distinguished according to whether they concern types or logic. Type rules involve type introduction and elimination, equality for application of operational symbols, and re-writing equations for non-canonical terms. The logic amounts to a sort of intuitionistic system in a Gentzen format. To conclude, we show that each system of our class enjoys a normalization property.</description>

      <title>Denotational semantics for languages of epistemic grounding based on Prawitz's theory of grounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline a class of term-languages for epistemic grounding inspired by Prawitz's theory of grounds. We show how denotation functions can be defined over these languages, relating terms to proof-objects built up of constructive functions. We discuss certain properties that the languages may enjoy both individually (canonical closure and universal denotation) and with respect to their expansions (primitive/non-primitive and conservative/non-conservative expansions). Finally, we provide a ground-theoretic version of Prawitz's completeness conjecture, and adapt to our framework a refutation of this conjecture due to Piecha and Schroeder-Heister.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every non-trivial ordered abelian group $G$ is augmentable by infinite elements, i.e., we have $G\preccurlyeq H\oplus G$ for some non-trivial ordered abelian group $H$. As an application, we show that when $k$ is a field of characteristic 0, then $k$ is not $t$-henselian if and only if all henselian valuations with residue field $k$ are ($\emptyset$-)definable.</description>

      <title>On pseudo-irreducibility and Boolean lifting property of filters in residuated lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of a pseudo-irreducible filter in a residuated lattice and compare this concept with related notions such as prime and maximal filters. Then, we recall the Boolean lifting property for filters and present useful characterizations for this property using pseudo-irreducible filters and the residuated lattice of fractions. Next, we study the Boolean lifting property of the radical of a filter. Furthermore, we introduce weak MTL-algebras and residuated lattices that have the transitional property of radicals decomposition (TPRD) as generalizations of several algebraic structures, including Boolean algebra, MV-algebra, BL-algebra, MTL-algebra, and Stonean residuated lattice. Moreover, by comparing weak MTL-algebras with other classes of residuated lattices, we address an open question concerning the Boolean lifting property of the radical of a residuated lattice. Finally, we give a topological answer to an open question about the Boolean lifting property of the radical of a residuated lattice. Several additional results are also obtained, further enriching the understanding of the Boolean lifting property in residuated lattices.</description>

      <title>Schnorr Randomness and Effective Bayesian Consistency and Inconsistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Doob's Consistency Theorem and Freedman's Inconsistency Theorem from the vantage point of computable probability and algorithmic randomness. We show that the Schnorr random elements of the parameter space are computably consistent, when there is a map from the sample space to the parameter space satisfying many of the same properties as limiting relative frequencies. We show that the generic inconsistency in Freedman's Theorem is effectively generic, which implies the existence of computable parameters which are not computably consistent. Taken together, this work provides a computability-theoretic solution to Diaconis and Freedman's problem of ``know[ing] for which [parameters] the rule [Bayes' rule] is consistent'', and it strengthens recent similar results of Takahashi on Martin-L\"of randomness in Cantor space.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic dilator and intermediate pointclasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two major generalizations of the standard ordinal analysis: One is Girard's $\Pi^1_2$-proof theory in which dilators are assigned to theories instead of ordinals. The other is Pohlers' generalized ordinal analysis with Spector classes, where ordinals greater than $\omega_1^{\mathsf{CK}}$ are assigned to theories. In this paper, we show that these two are systematically entangled, and $\Sigma^1_2$-proof theoretic analysis has a critical role in connecting these two.</description>

      <title>Possibility Frames and Forcing for Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the model theory of normal modal logics based on partial "possibilities" instead of total "worlds," following Humberstone (1981) instead of Kripke (1963). Possibility semantics can be seen as extending to modal logic the semantics for classical logic used in weak forcing in set theory, or as semanticizing a negative translation of classical modal logic into intuitionistic modal logic. Thus, possibility frames are based on posets with accessibility relations, like intuitionistic modal frames, but with the constraint that the interpretation of every formula is a regular open set in the Alexandrov topology on the poset. The standard world frames for modal logic are the special case of possibility frames wherein the poset is discrete. We develop the beginnings of duality theory, definability/correspondence theory, and completeness theory for possibility frames.</description>

      <title>A dagger kernel category of complete orthomodular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dagger kernel categories, a powerful framework for studying quantum phenomena within category theory, provide a rich mathematical structure that naturally encodes key aspects of quantum logic. This paper focuses on the category SupOMLatLin of complete orthomodular lattices with linear maps. We demonstrate that SupOMLatLin itself forms a dagger kernel category, equipped with additional structure such as dagger biproducts and free objects. A key result establishes that every morphism in SupOMLatLin admits an essentially unique factorization as a zero-epi followed by a dagger monomorphism. This factorization theorem, along with the dagger kernel category structure of SupOMLatLin, provides new insights into the interplay between complete orthomodular lattices and the foundational concepts of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Policy-Adaptable Methods For Resolving Normative Conflicts Through Argumentation and Graph Colouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a multi-agent system, one may choose to govern the behaviour of an agent by imposing norms, which act as guidelines for how agents should act either all of the time or in given situations. However, imposing multiple norms on one or more agents may result in situations where these norms conflict over how the agent should behave. In any system with normative conflicts (such as safe reinforcement models or systems which monitor safety protocols), one must decide which norms should be followed such that the most important and most relevant norms are maintained. We introduce a new method for resolving normative conflicts through argumentation and graph colouring which is compatible with a variety of normative conflict resolution policies. We prove that this method always creates an admissible set of arguments under argumentation semantics, meaning that it produces coherent outputs. We also introduce more robust variants of this method, each building upon their predecessor to create a superior output, and we include further mathematical proof of their coherence. Our most advanced variant uses the existing concept of curtailment, where one norm may supersede another without fully eliminating it. The methods we introduce are all compatible with various pre-existing policies for resolving normative conflicts. Empirical evaluations are also performed to compare our algorithms to each other and to others in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Locally tabular products of modal logics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the product $L_1\times L_2$ of two Kripke complete consistent logics, local tabularity of $L_1$ and $L_2$ is necessary for local tabularity of $L_1\times L_2$. However, it is not sufficient: the product of two locally tabular logics may not be locally tabular. We provide extra semantic and axiomatic conditions that give criteria of local tabularity of the product of two locally tabular logics, and apply them to identify new families of locally tabular products. We show that the product of two locally tabular logics may lack the product finite model property. We give an axiomatic criterion of local tabularity for all extensions of $S4.1 [ 2 ]\times S5$. Finally, we describe a new prelocally tabular extension of $S{4}\times S{5}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current ordinal analysis provides the proof-theoretic ordinal of a theory, which calibrates the robustness of the $\Pi^1_1$-consequences of the theory. We can ask whether there is an ordinal characteristic capturing more complex consequences, and it turns out that we can define the $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal capturing the robustness of the $\Sigma^1_2$-consequences of a theory. In this paper, we study the behavior of $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal, and it turns out that $\Sigma^1_2$-proof-theoretic ordinal also follows an analogue of Walsh's characterization of proof-theoretic ordinal.</description>

      <title>On Quantifiers for Quantitative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04936v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a kind of first-order predicate logic with intended semantics in the reals. Compared to other approaches in the literature, we work predominantly in the multiplicative reals $[0,\infty]$, showing they support three generations of connectives, that we call non-linear, linear additive, and linear multiplicative. Means and harmonic means emerge as natural candidates for bounded existential and universal quantifiers, and in fact we see they behave as expected in relation to the other logical connectives. We explain this fact through the well-known fact that min/max and arithmetic mean/harmonic mean sit at opposite ends of a spectrum, that of p-means. We give syntax and semantics for this quantitative predicate logic, and as example applications, we show how softmax is the quantitative semantics of argmax, and R\'enyi entropy/Hill numbers are additive/multiplicative semantics of the same formula. Indeed, the additive reals also fit into the story by exploiting the Napierian duality $-\log \dashv 1/\exp$, which highlights a formal distinction between 'additive' and 'multiplicative' quantities. Finally, we describe two attempts at a categorical semantics via enriched hyperdoctrines. We discuss why hyperdoctrines are in fact probably inadequate for this kind of logic.</description>

      <title>Paradox on the Countable Axiom of Choice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bishop's constructive mathematics school rejects the Law of Excluded Middle, but instead vastly makes use of weaker versions of the Choice. In this paper we pioneer an example, which shows that this road is not consistent, as our example provides a paradox. Therefore, rejecting the Law of Excluded Middle, and as an alternative using the Countable Axiom of Choice and the Axiom of Dependent Choice, still does not create a consistent structure. Actually, constructively; the Countable Axiom of Choice is an implication of the Axiom of Dependent Choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the results of Jacobs, we show that the category OMLatLin of orthomodular lattices and linear maps forms a dagger category. For each orthomodular lattice X, we construct a Foulis m-semilattice Lin(X) composed of endomorphisms of X. This m-semilattice acts as a quantale, enabling us to regard X as a left Lin(X)-module. Our novel approach introduces a fuzzy-theoretic dimension to the theory of orthomodular lattices.</description>

      <title>Probability Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a formal definition of the concept of probability tree and conduct a detailed and comprehensive study of its fundamental structural properties. In particular, we define what we term an inductive probability measure and prove that such trees can be identified with these measures. Furthermore, we prove that probability trees are completely determined by probability measures on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of the tree's body.
  We then explore applications of probability trees in several areas of mathematics, including probability theory, measure theory, and set theory. In the first, we show that the cumulative distribution of finitely many dependent and non-identically distributed Bernouli tests is bounded by the cumulative distribution of some binomial distribution. In the second, we establish a close relationship between probability trees and the real line, showing that Borel, measurable sets, and their measures can be preserved, as well as other combinatorial properties. Finally, in set theory, we establish that the null ideal associated with suitable probability trees is Tukey equivalent to the null ideal on $[0, 1]$. This leads to a new elementary proof of the fact that the null ideal of a free $\sigma$-finite Borel measure on a Polish space is Tukey equivalent with the null ideal of $\mathbb{R}$, which supports that the associated cardinal characteristics remain invariant across the spaces in which they are defined.</description>
