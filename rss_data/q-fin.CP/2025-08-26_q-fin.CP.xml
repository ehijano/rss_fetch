      <title>Tracing Positional Bias in Financial Decision-Making: Mechanistic Insights from Qwen2.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in finance exposes high-stakes decision-making to subtle, underexamined positional biases. The complexity and opacity of modern model architectures compound this risk. We present the first unified framework and benchmark that not only detects and quantifies positional bias in binary financial decisions but also pinpoints its mechanistic origins within open-source Qwen2.5-instruct models (1.5B--14B). Our empirical analysis covers a novel, finance-authentic dataset revealing that positional bias is pervasive, scale-sensitive, and prone to resurfacing under nuanced prompt designs and investment scenarios, with recency and primacy effects revealing new vulnerabilities in risk-laden contexts. Through transparent mechanistic interpretability, we map how and where bias emerges and propagates within the models to deliver actionable, generalizable insights across prompt types and scales. By bridging domain-specific audit with model interpretability, our work provides a new methodological standard for both rigorous bias diagnosis and practical mitigation, establishing essential guidance for responsible and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in financial systems.</description>

      <title>Jump detection in financial asset prices that exhibit U-shape volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a Matlab routine that allows us to estimate the jumps in financial asset prices using the Threshold (or Truncation) method of Mancini (2009). The routine is designed for application to five-minute log-returns. The underlying assumption is that asset prices evolve in time following an Ito semimartingale with, possibly stochastic, volatility and jumps. A log-return is likely to contain a jump if its absolute value is larger than a threshold determined by the maximum increment of the Brownian semimartingale part. The latter is particularly sensitive to the magnitude of the volatility coefficient, and from an empirical point of view, volatility levels typically depend on the time of day (TOD), with volatility being highest at the beginning and end of the day, while it is low in the middle. The first routine presented allows for an estimation of the TOD effect, and is an implementation of the method described in Bollerslev and Todorov (2011). Subsequently, the TOD effect for the stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) is visualized. The second routine presented is an implementation of the threshold method for estimating jumps in AAPL prices. The procedure recursively estimates daily volatility and jumps. In each round, the threshold depends on the time of the day and is constructed using the estimate of the daily volatility multiplied by the daytime TOD factor and by the continuity modulus of the Brownian motion paths. Once the jumps are detected, the daily volatility estimate is updated using only the log-returns not containing jumps. Before application to empirical data, the reliability of the procedure was separately tested on simulated asset prices. The results obtained on a record of AAPL stock prices are visualized.</description>

      <title>Identifying Risk Variables From ESG Raw Data Using A Hierarchical Variable Selection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors aim to provide non-financial insights into corporations. In this study, we investigate whether we can extract relevant ESG variables to assess corporate risk, as measured by logarithmic volatility. We propose a novel Hierarchical Variable Selection (HVS) algorithm to identify a parsimonious set of variables from raw data that are most relevant to risk. HVS is specifically designed for ESG datasets characterized by a tree structure with significantly more variables than observations. Our findings demonstrate that HVS achieves significantly higher performance than models using pre-aggregated ESG scores. Furthermore, when compared with traditional variable selection methods, HVS achieves superior explanatory power using a more parsimonious set of ESG variables. We illustrate the methodology using company data from various sectors of the US economy.</description>

      <title>Is attention truly all we need? An empirical study of asset pricing in pretrained RNN sparse and global attention models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the pretrained RNN attention models with the mainstream attention mechanisms such as additive attention, Luong's three attentions, global self-attention (Self-att) and sliding window sparse attention (Sparse-att) for the empirical asset pricing research on top 420 large-cap US stocks. This is the first paper on the large-scale state-of-the-art (SOTA) attention mechanisms applied in the asset pricing context. They overcome the limitations of the traditional machine learning (ML) based asset pricing, such as mis-capturing the temporal dependency and short memory. Moreover, the enforced causal masks in the attention mechanisms address the future data leaking issue ignored by the more advanced attention-based models, such as the classic Transformer. The proposed attention models also consider the temporal sparsity characteristic of asset pricing data and mitigate potential overfitting issues by deploying the simplified model structures. This provides some insights for future empirical economic research. All models are examined in three periods, which cover pre-COVID-19 (mild uptrend), COVID-19 (steep uptrend with a large drawdown) and one year post-COVID-19 (sideways movement with high fluctuations), for testing the stability of these models under extreme market conditions. The study finds that in value-weighted portfolio back testing, Model Self-att and Model Sparse-att exhibit great capabilities in deriving the absolute returns and hedging downside risks, while they achieve an annualized Sortino ratio of 2.0 and 1.80 respectively in the period with COVID-19. And Model Sparse-att performs more stably than Model Self-att from the perspective of absolute portfolio returns with respect to the size of stocks' market capitalization.</description>

      <title>MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</description>
