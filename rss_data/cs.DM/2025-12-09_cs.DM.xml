      <title>On the hardness of recognizing graphs of small mim-width and its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mim-width of a graph is a powerful structural parameter that, when bounded by a constant, allows several hard problems to be polynomial-time solvable - with a recent meta-theorem encompassing a large class of problems [SODA2023]. Since its introduction, several variants such as sim-width and omim-width were developed, along with a linear version of these parameters. It was recently shown that mim-width and all these variants all paraNP-hard, a consequence of the NP-hardness of distinguishing between graphs of linear mim-width at most 1211 and graphs of sim-width at least 1216 [ICALP2025]. The complexity of recognizing graphs of small width, particularly those close to $1$, remained open, despite their especially attractive algorithmic applications.
  In this work, we show that the width recognition problems remain NP-hard even on small widths. Specifically, after introducing the novel parameter Omim-width sandwiched between omim-width and mim-width, we show that: (1) deciding whether a graph has sim-width = 1, omim-width = 1, or Omin-width = 1 is NP-hard, and the same is true for their linear variants; (2) the problems of deciding whether mim-width $\leq$ 2 or linear mim-width $\leq$ 2 are both NP-hard. Interestingly, our reductions are relatively simple and are from the Unrooted Quartet Consistency problem, which is of great interest in computational biology but is not commonly used (if ever) in the theory of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Extended formulations for the maximum weighted co-2-plex problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an input graph and weights on its vertices, the maximum co-2-plex problem is to find a subset of vertices maximizing the sum of their weights and inducing a graph of degree at most 1. In this article, we analyze polyhedral aspects of the maximum co-2-plex problem. The co-2-plexes of a graph are known to be in bijection with the stable sets of an auxiliary graph called the utter graph~\cite{dupontbouillard2024contractions}. We use this bijection to characterize contraction perfect graphs' co-2-plex polytopes in an extended space. It turns out that the total dual integrality of the associated linear system also characterizes contraction perfectness of the input graph.
  By projecting this extended space formulation, we obtain the natural variable space description of the co-2-plex polytopes of trees. This projection yields a new family of valid inequalities for the co-2-plex polytope and we characterize when they define facets. Moreover, we show that these inequalities can be separated in polynomial time. We characterize the graphs for which this formulation describes an integer polytope.
  These linear systems are extended to valid integer linear programs (ILPs) for the maximum co-2-plex problem whose linear relaxation values are tighter than the state of the art for this problem~\cite{bala}. Finally, we provide an experimental comparison of several implementations of our new ILP formulations with the state-of-the-art ILP for this problem and analyze their respective performances relatively to the density of the input graphs.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Materials Discovery: Learning a Universal Representation of Chemical Processes for Cross-Domain Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental validation of chemical processes is slow and costly, limiting exploration in materials discovery. Machine learning can prioritize promising candidates, but existing data in patents and literature is heterogeneous and difficult to use. We introduce a universal directed-tree process-graph representation that unifies unstructured text, molecular structures, and numeric measurements into a single machine-readable format. To learn from this structured data, we developed a multi-modal graph neural network with a property-conditioned attention mechanism. Trained on approximately 700,000 process graphs from nearly 9,000 diverse documents, our model learns semantically rich embeddings that generalize across domains. When fine-tuned on compact, domain-specific datasets, the pretrained model achieves strong performance, demonstrating that universal process representations learned at scale transfer effectively to specialized prediction tasks with minimal additional data.</description>

      <title>Circular Chromatic Numbers, Balanceability, Relation Algebras, and Network Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize graphs with circular chromatic number less than 3 in terms of certain balancing labellings studied in the context of signed graphs. In fact, we construct a signed graph which is universal for all such labellings of graphs with circular chromatic number less than $3$, and is closely related to the generic circular triangle-free graph studied by Bodirsky and Guzm\'an-Pro. Moreover, our universal structure gives rise to a representation of the relation algebra $56_{65}$. We then use this representation to show that the network satisfaction problem described by this relation algebra belongs to NP. This concludes the full classification of the existence of a universal square representation, as well as the complexity of the corresponding network satisfaction problem, for relation algebras with at most four atoms.</description>

      <title>Bell Numbers and Stirling Numbers of the Mycielskian of Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish explicit formulas for Bell numbers and graphical Stirling numbers of complete multipartite graphs, complete bipartite graphs with removed perfect matchings, and Mycielskian trees. For complete multipartite graphs $K(n_1,\ldots,n_\ell)$, we provide a simplified proof that $B(G) = \prod_{i=1}^\ell \bell{n_i}$. We derive $B(K_{n,n} - M) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \bell{k}^2$ for removed perfect matching $M$, and for Mycielskian star graphs, $B(M(St_n); 3) = 2^n + 1$ and $B(M(St_n); 2n) = 2n^2 - 3n + 3$. Results extend to Mycielskians of arbitrary trees. Our computational verifications establish links between graphical Bell numbers and fundamental sequences in combinatorics and pattern avoidance, including identification of several OEIS entries: A000051, A096376, A116735, A384980, A384981, A384988, A385432, and A385437.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for the $b$-Matching and List-Restricted Variants of MaxQAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study approximation algorithms for two natural generalizations of the Maximum Quadratic Assignment Problem (MaxQAP). In the Maximum List-Restricted Quadratic Assignment Problem, each node in one partite set may only be matched to nodes from a prescribed list. For instances on $n$ nodes where every list has size at least $n - O(\sqrt{n})$, we design a randomized $O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation algorithm based on the linear-programming relaxation and randomized rounding framework of Makarychev, Manokaran, and Sviridenko. In the Maximum Quadratic $b$-Matching Assignment Problem, we seek a $b$-matching that maximizes the MaxQAP objective. We refine the standard MaxQAP relaxation and combine randomized rounding over $b$ independent iterations with a polynomial-time algorithm for maximum-weight $b$-matching problem to obtain an $O(\sqrt{bn})$-approximation. When $b$ is constant and all lists have size $n - O(\sqrt{n})$, our guarantees asymptotically match the best known approximation factor for MaxQAP, yielding the first approximation algorithms for these two variants.</description>

      <title>The Ultimate Signs of Second-Order Holonomic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A real-valued sequence $f = \{ f(n) \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is said to be second-order holonomic if it satisfies a linear recurrence $f (n + 2) = P (n) f (n + 1) + Q (n) f (n)$ for all sufficiently large $n$, where $P, Q \in \mathbb{R}(x)$ are rational functions. We study the ultimate sign of such a sequence, i.e., the repeated pattern that the signs of $f (n)$ follow for sufficiently large $n$. For each $P$, $Q$ we determine all the ultimate signs that $f$ can have, and show how they partition the space of initial values of $f$. This completes the prior work by Neumann, Ouaknine and Worrell, who have settled some restricted cases. As a corollary, it follows that when $P$, $Q$ have rational coefficients, $f$ either has an ultimate sign of length $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, $8$ or $12$, or never falls into a repeated sign pattern. We also give a partial algorithm that finds the ultimate sign of $f$ (or tells that there is none) in almost all cases.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Hardness Results for Conflict-free Choosability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A '(partial) conflict-free coloring' of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is an assignment of colors to (a subset of) the vertex set of $\mathcal{H}$ such that every hyperedge in $\mathcal{H}$ has a vertex whose color is distinct from every other vertex in that hyperedge. The minimum number of colors required for such a coloring is known as the '(partial) conflict-free chromatic number' of $\mathcal{H}$. It is easy to see that the conflict-free chromatic number of a hypergraph is at most its partial conflict-free chromatic number plus one. Conflict-free coloring has also been studied on the open/closed neighborhood hypergraphs of a given graph under the name open/closed neighborhood conflict-free coloring. In this paper, we study partial and full list variants of conflict-free coloring where, for every vertex $v$, we are given a list of admissible colors $L_v$ such that $v$ is allowed to be colored only from $L_v$.
  Bhyravarapu, Kalyanasundaram, and Mathew [Journal of Graph Theory, 2021] showed that the closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number of any graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ is at most $O(\ln^2 \Delta)$. In this paper, we extend the $O(\ln^2 \Delta)$ upper bound to the partial list variant of the closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number. Further, we establish computational complexity results concerning the list open/closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic numbers.</description>

      <title>Set families: restricted distances via restricted intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denote by $f_D(n)$ the maximum size of a set family $\mathcal{F}$ on $[n] \stackrel{\mbox{\normalfont\tiny def}}{=} \{1, \dots, n\}$ with distance set $D$. That is, $|A \bigtriangleup B| \in D$ holds for every pair of distinct sets $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$. Kleitman's celebrated discrete isodiametric inequality states that $f_D(n)$ is maximized at Hamming balls of radius $d/2$ when $D = \{1, \dots, d\}$. We study the generalization where $D$ is a set of arithmetic progression and determine $f_D(n)$ asymptotically for all homogeneous $D$. In the special case when $D$ is an interval, our result confirms a conjecture of Huang, Klurman, and Pohoata. Moreover, we demonstrate a dichotomy in the growth of $f_D(n)$, showing linear growth in $n$ when $D$ is a non-homogeneous arithmetic progression. Different from previous combinatorial and spectral approaches, we deduce our results by converting the restricted distance problems to restricted intersection problems.
  Our proof ideas can be adapted to prove upper bounds on $t$-distance sets in Hamming cubes (also known as binary $t$-codes), which has been extensively studied by algebraic combinatorialists community, improving previous bounds from polynomial methods and optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for the Optimal Design of Parking Lots with One-way and Two-way Lanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of maximizing the number of stalls in parking lots where vehicles park perpendicular to the driveways. Building on recent research on two-way driving lanes, we first formulate a mixed integer program to maximize the number of parking stalls using a flow-based approach. Parking lots are rasterized into a grid, and the proposed MIP model optimizes them in a generic manner, adapting to the grid resolution and stall size without requiring custom formulations. The constraints ensure the connectivity of parking stalls and driveways to the entrance/exit. This formulation is then extended to the case of one-way driving lanes. We then propose valid inequalities and a branch-and-cut algorithm for the one-way and two-way lane configurations. This approach eliminates flow variables, big-M type constraints, and improves solution times for medium-sized instances. The effectiveness of the suggested models is showcased on 325 parking lots from New York City. For instances in which the flow version could be solved in 15 minutes, the branch-and-cut algorithm improved the median runtimes by 87.43% for the one-way case and by 79.36% for the two-way case and resulted in better optimality gaps for the other instances, compared to the baseline flow-based formulation. Similar advantages were observed when run with a time budget of two hours. One-way configurations accommodated, on average, 18.63% more vehicles on average than their two-way counterparts across all instances. Modifications to the proposed formulations that consider the turning characteristics of vehicles and the presence of multiple entrances and exits are also examined.</description>

      <title>On the Incompressibility of Truth With Application to Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamentals of Circuit Complexity and the nature of efficient computation from a new perspective. We present a framework for understanding Circuit Complexity through the lens of Information Theory with analogies to results in Kolmogorov Complexity, viewing circuits as descriptions of truth tables, encoded in logical gates and wires, rather than purely computational devices. From this framework, we re-prove some existing strong Circuit Complexity bounds, explain what the optimal circuits for most Boolean functions look like structurally, give insight into new circuit bounds, and explain the aforementioned results in a unifying intuition that re-frames time entirely.</description>
