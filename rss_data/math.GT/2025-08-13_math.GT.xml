      <title>Distinguishing Curve Types and Designer Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\gamma$ be a filling curve on a topological surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g \geq 2$. The inf invariant of $\gamma$, denoted $m_{\gamma}$, is the infimum of the length function on the space of marked hyperbolic structures on $\Sigma$. This infimum is realized at a unique hyperbolic structure, $X_{\gamma}$, which we call the optimal metric associated to $\gamma$. In this paper, we investigate properties of the inf invariant and its associated optimal metric. Starting from a filling curve and a separating curve, we construct a two integer parameter family of curves for which we derive coarse length bounds and qualitative properties of their associated optimal metrics. In particular, we show that there are infinitely many pairs of filling curves, each pair having distinct $\text{inf}$ invariants but the same self-intersection number.
  The inf invariants give rise to a natural spectrum, we call the inf spectrum, associated to the moduli space of the surface. We provide coarse bounds for this spectrum.</description>

      <title>Minimising length of closed billiard trajectories on hyperbolic polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a hyperbolic polygon any finite collection of closed billiard trajectories can be assigned an average length function. In this paper, we consider the average length of the collection of cyclically related closed billiard trajectories in even-sided right-angled polygons and the collection of reflectively related closed billiard trajectories in Lambert quadrilaterals with acute angle $\pi/k$. We show that in the former case the average length is minimised by the regular evensided right-angled polygon, and in the latter case it is minimised by the Lambert quadrilateral with a reflective symmetry about its long axis. We use techniques from Teichmueller theory to prove the main theorems.</description>

      <title>Maximal dilatation on nonorientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On each nonorientable surface of even genus $g \geq 4$, we show that the Liechti-Strenner's polynomial in~\cite{LiechtiStrenner18} gives a maximal dilatation among pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms with an orientable invariant foliation. This is proved by showing that this polynomial is irreducible.</description>

      <title>Percolation in acylindrically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08932v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an acylindrically hyperbolic group. We prove that Bernoulli bond percolation on every Cayley graph of $G$ has a nonuniqueness phase, in which there are infinitely many infinite clusters. This generalizes Hutchcroft's result for Gromov hyperbolic graphs to relatively hyperbolic groups, mapping class groups and rank-1 CAT(0) groups for example.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of quadratic differentials: Abel-Jacobi map and deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the moduli space of framed quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities parameterized by a decorated marked surface with punctures (DMSp), where simple zeros, double poles and higher order poles respectively correspond to decorations, punctures and boundary components. We show that the fundamental group of this space equals the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi (AJ) map from the surface mapping class group of DMSp to the first homology group of the marked surface (without decorations/punctures). Moreover, a universal cover of this space is given by the space of stability conditions on the associated 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Furthermore, when we partially compactify and orbifold this moduli space by allowing the collision of simple zeros and some of the double poles, the resulting moduli space is isomorphic to a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the deformed (with respect to those collidable double poles) 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Finally, we show that the fundamental group of this partially compactified orbifold equals the quotient group of the kernel of the AJ map by the square of any point-pushing diffeomorphism around any collidable double pole. This construction can produces any non-exceptional spherical/Euclidean Artin braid groups.</description>

      <title>Distributional Topological Complexity of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerical invariants $d\TC(\Gamma)$ and $d\cat(\Gamma)$ of groups recently introduced in \cite{DJ} and independently in \cite{KW}. We compute $d\TC$ for finite cyclic groups $\mathbb Z_p$ with prime $p$ as well as for nonorientable surfaces of genus $g&gt;3$ (for orientable surfaces it was computed in \cite{DJ}). We prove the formula $$d\TC(G\ast H)=\max\{d\TC (G),d\TC (H), \cd(G\times H)\}$$ for torsion free groups.</description>

      <title>The knot meridians of (1,1)-knot complements are CTF-detected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any non-simple (1,1)-knot in $S^3$ or a lens space, we construct a co-oriented taut foliation in its complement that intersects the boundary torus transversely in a suspension foliation of the knot meridian, or the infinity slope. This provides new evidence for a conjecture made by Boyer, Gordon and Hu using slope detections, related to the L-space conjecture.</description>

      <title>Jiggling: an h-principle without homotopical assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The jiggling lemma of Thurston shows that any triangulation can be jiggled (read: subdivided and then perturbed) to be in general position with respect to a distribution. Our main result is a generalization of Thurston's lemma. It states that piecewise smooth solutions of a given open and fiberwise dense differential relation $\mathcal{R} \subset J^1(E)$ of first order can be constructed by jiggling arbitrary sections of $E$. Our statement also holds in parametric and relative form. We understand this as an h-principle without homotopical assumptions for piecewise smooth solutions of $\mathcal{R}$.</description>

      <title>Dax invariant for closed embedded surfaces and the mapping class group of $\Sigma\times S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M=\Sigma\times S^2$ where $\Sigma$ is a closed oriented surface with positive genus, let $\operatorname{MCG}(M)$ be the smooth mapping class group of $M$. We show that there exists a surjective homomorphism from $\operatorname{MCG}(M)$ to $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ such that its restriction to the subgroup of elements pseudo-isotopic to the identity also has infinite rank. We also classify the isotopy classes of embeddings of $\Sigma$ in $M$ that are geometrically dual to $\{\operatorname{pt}\}\times S^2$, and show that there exist infinitely many such embeddings in $M$ that are homotopic to each other but are mutually non-isotopic to each other. This answers a question of Gabai. The proofs are based on a generalization of the Dax invariant to embedded closed surfaces.</description>

      <title>Nearly geodesic surfaces are filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic $3$-manifold. A homotopy class $[S]$ of surfaces in $M$ is filling if any representative cuts $M$ into components contractible in $M$. We prove that there exist $\epsilon_0, g_0&gt;0$ such that every homotopy class of $(1+\epsilon)$-quasi-Fuchsian surfaces with $0&lt;\epsilon\leq \epsilon_0$ or totally geodesic surfaces of genus $\geq g_0$ in $M$ is filling. As a corollary, except for at most finitely many totally geodesic surfaces, embedded incompressible quasi-Fuchsian surfaces in $M$ have constants bounded below by $1+\epsilon_0$. This also gives a gap theorem for embedded minimal surfaces. Each of these surfaces separates any pair of distinct points at the sphere of infinity. Crucial tools include the rigidity results of Mozes-Shah, Ratner, and Shah. This work is inspired by a question of Wu and Xue whether random geodesics on random hyperbolic surfaces are filling.</description>

      <title>The real Mordell-Weil group of rational elliptic surfaces and real lines on del Pezzo surfaces of degree $K^2=1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We undertake a study of topological properties of the real Mordell-Weil group $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ of real rational elliptic surfaces $X$ which we accompany by a related study of real lines on $X$ and on the "subordinate" del Pezzo surfaces $Y$ of degree 1. We give an explicit description of isotopy types of real lines on $Y_{\mathbb R}$ and an explicit presentation of $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ in the mapping class group $\operatorname{Mod}(X_{\mathbb R})$. Combining these results we establish an explicit formula for the action of $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ in $H_1(X_{\mathbb R})$.</description>

      <title>Random quotients preserve acylindrical and hierarchical hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that random quotients of acylindrically hyperbolic groups, obtained by taking a quotient of the group by the $n$th steps of a finite collection of independent random walks, are again acylindrically hyperbolic asymptotically almost surely. Our main tools come from spinning families and projection complexes, which we relate to random walks and develop further. Furthermore, we show that a random quotient of a hierarchically hyperbolic group is again hierarchically hyperbolic asymptotically almost surely. The same techniques also yield that a random quotient of a non-elementary hyperbolic group (relative to a finite collection of peripheral subgroups) is asymptotically almost surely hyperbolic (relative to isomorphic peripheral subgroups).</description>
