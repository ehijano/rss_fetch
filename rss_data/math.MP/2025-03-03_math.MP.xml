      <title>Solving the Riccati Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the Riccati equation is resolved using the generalized recursive integrating factor method. By applying a non-linear transformation to the dependent variable $y(x)$ of the Riccati equation, a second-order linear differential equation is derived for a variable $u(x)$ that is related to $y(x)$ through the aforementioned transformation. The second-order differential equation is then addressed using the aforementioned integrating factors method to derive the general solution for $u(x)$, which is subsequently transformed back to obtain the general solution for $y(x)$, thereby resolving the Riccati equation. The general solution to the Riccati equation is presented, followed by solving a few illustrative application examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum group deformation of the Kittel--Shore model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kittel--Shore (KS) Hamiltonian describes $N$ spins with long-range interactions that are identically coupled. In this paper, the underlying $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ coalgebra symmetry of the KS model is demonstrated for arbitrary spins, and the quantum deformation of the KS Hamiltonian ($q$-KS model) is obtained using the corresponding $\mathfrak{su}_q(2)$ quantum group. By construction, the existence of such a symmetry guarantees that all integrability properties of the KS model are preserved under $q$-deformation. In particular, the $q$-KS model for spin-$1/2$ particles is analysed in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, and the cases with $N=2,3,$ and $4$ spins are studied in detail. The higher-spin $q$-KS models are sketched.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian formulation for dissipative materials using Lie derivatives and GENERIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recall the systematic formulation of Eulerian mechanics in terms of Lie derivatives along the vector field of the material points. Using the abstract properties of Lie derivatives we show that the transport via Lie derivatives generates in a natural way a Poisson structure on the chosen phase space.
  The evolution equations for thermo-viscoelastic-viscoplastic materials in the Eulerian setting is formulated in the abstract framework of GENERIC (General Equations for Non-Equilibrium Reversible Irreversible Coupling). The equations may not be new, but the systematic splitting between reversible Hamiltonian and dissipative effects allows us to see the equations in a new light that is especially useful for future generalizing of the system, e.g., for adding new effects like reactive species.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to systematically characterize gapped phases in 2+1 dimensions with categorical symmetries. The SymTFTs that we consider are (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups $G$, whose gapped boundaries realize all so-called ``All Bosonic type" fusion 2-category symmetries. In arXiv:2408.05266 we provided the general framework and studied the case where $G$ is an abelian group. In this work we focus on the case of non-Abelian $G$. Gapped boundary conditions play a central role in the SymTFT construction of symmetric gapped phases. These fall into two broad families: minimal and non-minimal boundary conditions, respectively. The first kind corresponds to boundaries on which all line operators are obtainable as boundary projections of bulk line operators. The symmetries on such boundaries include (anomalous) 2-groups and 2-representation categories of 2-groups. Conversely non-minimal boundaries contain line operators that are intrinsic to the boundaries. The symmetries on such boundaries correspond to fusion 2-categories where modular tensor categories intertwine non-trivially with the above symmetry types. We discuss in detail the generalized charges of these symmetries and their condensation patterns that give rise to a zoo of rich beyond-Landau gapped phases. Among these are phases that exhibit novel patterns of symmetry breaking wherein the symmetry broken vacua carry distinct kinds of topological order. We exemplify this framework for the case where $G$ is a dihedral group.</description>

      <title>Constant maps in equivariant topological strings and geometric modeling of fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equivariant generalization of topological strings on toric manifolds, with a particular focus on defining the contributions of constant maps in the genus expansion of the partition function. This analysis is supported by a broad set of explicit examples. Our investigation highlights the geometric modeling of flux compactifications and clarifies the link between the effective supergravity framework and the equivariant topological string formalism, building on recent developments by Martelli and Zaffaroni. We conclude that the connection between topological string theory and supergravity/field theory involves switching between geometric moduli and fluxes, shedding light on the role of ensemble averages in string theory. We propose an exact non-perturbative holographic match with the corresponding M2-brane partition functions, which we test perturbatively at all orders in the gauge group rank $N$ in a companion paper. A special case of our proposal for vanishing flux reformulates the Ooguri--Strominger--Vafa conjecture within the equivariant topological string framework.</description>

      <title>On the nonlinearity of Four-Dimensional Conformal Transformations in spinor representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinearity of the conformal group is an essential factor that ruins the global conformal invariance for interacting material fields. In this paper we attempt to track such nonlinearity from spacetime transformations to spinor representations. To this end we rederive the spinor representation by generalizing the linear fractional transformation from two dimensions to four dimensions via replacing complex numbers with biquaternions. To check the effect of the nonlinearity we apply the translations and special conformal transformations (SCTs) to Dirac spinors in certain interactions. These two transformations do not lead to nonlinear terms in Yukawa term, but do in vector-spinor interaction. And the nonlinear terms would definitely cause $CP$ violation.</description>

      <title>Spinning boson stars in nonlinear sigma models and Universal Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the scalar field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. Concretely, we obtain spinning boson star solutions for a family of models parametrized by the curvature of their two-dimensional target manifold, as well as for various self-interaction potentials. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions, allowing for a range of notably different masses and degrees of compactness. However, we find that the relations between different multipoles are consistent with those for the standard complex scalar stars, and hence the universality of such relations is extended to curved target spaces.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Long-Range Interactions via the Multipole Expansion into Ground and Excited-State Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating long-range interactions remains a significant challenge for molecular machine learning potentials due to the need to accurately capture interactions over large spatial regions. In this work, we introduce FieldMACE, an extension of the message-passing atomic cluster expansion (MACE) architecture that integrates the multipole expansion to model long-range interactions more efficiently. By incorporating the multipole expansion, FieldMACE effectively captures environmental and long-range effects in both ground and excited states. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate its superior performance in predictions and computational efficiency compared to previous architectures, as well as its ability to accurately simulate nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics. Furthermore, transfer learning from foundational models enhances data efficiency, making FieldMACE a scalable, robust, and transferable framework for large-scale molecular simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional harmonic vibronic model, which is a generalization of the so-called linear Landau-Zener model and appears in the form of coupled Schr\"{o}dinger equations, is revisited. After decoupling the components, the resulting fourth-order equation is shown to have a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. The so-called exceptional part of the spectrum is then expressed in a rather simple way. For completeness, the eigenfunctions are obtained via the Bethe ansatz approach directly in position space.</description>

      <title>Exercises on the Kepler ellipses through a fixed point in space, after Otto Laporte</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article has a twofold purpose. On the one hand I would like to draw attention to some nice exercises on the Kepler laws, due to Otto Laporte from 1970. Our discussion here has a more geometric flavour than the original analytic approach of Laporte. On the other hand it serves as an addendum to a paper of mine from 1998 on the quantum integrability of the Kovalevsky top. Later I learned that this integrability result had been obtained already long before by Laporte in 1933.</description>

      <title>Quantum arrival times in free fall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution of a time measurement $T_x$ at position $x$ can be inferred from the probability distribution of a position measurement $X_t$ at time $t$ as given by the Born rule [Time-of-arrival distributions for continuous quantum systems and application to quantum backflow, Phys. Rev. A 110, 052217 (2024)]. In an application to free-fall, this finding has been used to predict the existence of a mass-dependent positive relative shift with respect to the classical time-of-arrival in the long time-of-flight regime for dropped quantum particles [M. Beau and L. Martellini, Quantum delay in the time of arrival of free-falling atoms, Phys. Rev. A 109, 012216 (2024).]. The present paper extends these results in two important directions. We first show that for a Gaussian quantum particle of mass $m$ dropped in a uniform gravitational field $g$, the uncertainties about time and position measurements are related by the relation $ \Delta T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg} . $ This novel form of uncertainty relation suggests that choosing the initial state so as to obtain a lower uncertainty in the measured position leads to a higher uncertainty in the measured arrival time. Secondly, we examine the case of a free-falling particle starting from a non-Gaussian initial superposed state, for which we predict the presence of gravitationally induced interferences and oscillations in the mean time-of-arrival as a function of the detector's position that can be interpreted as the signature of a Zitterbewegung-like effect.</description>

      <title>How a Space-Time Singularity Helps Remove the Ultraviolet Divergence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle creation terms in quantum Hamiltonians are usually ultraviolet divergent and thus mathematically ill defined. A rather novel way of solving this problem is based on imposing so-called interior-boundary conditions on the wave function. Previous papers showed that this approach works in the non-relativistic regime, but particle creation is mostly relevant in the relativistic case after all. In flat relativistic space-time (that is, neglecting gravity), the approach was previously found to work only for certain somewhat artificial cases. Here, as a way of taking gravity into account, we consider curved space-time, specifically the super-critical Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time, which features a naked timelike singularity. We find that the interior-boundary approach works fully in this setting; in particular, we prove rigorously the existence of well-defined, self-adjoint Hamiltonians with particle creation at the singularity, based on interior-boundary conditions. We also non-rigorously analyze the asymptotic behavior of the Bohmian trajectories and construct the corresponding Bohm-Bell process of particle creation, motion, and annihilation. The upshot is that in quantum physics, a naked space-time singularity need not lead to a breakdown of physical laws, but on the contrary allows for boundary conditions governing what comes out of the singularity and thereby removing the ultraviolet divergence.</description>

Abstract: In this study, a recursive solution technique in conjunction with generalized integrating factors is presented and applied to address first and second order linear differential equations. This approach demonstrates practical utility in classical differential equations encountered in physics, inclusive of equations with variable coefficients, particularly when a pattern within the recursion is identifiable, thus enabling the derivation of an explicit expression for $y(x)$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic boundary KZB operators and quantum Calogero-Moser spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.13497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic boundary KZB equations describe the consistency conditions of degenerations of correlation functions for boundary Wess-Zumino-Witten-Novikov conformal field theory on a cylinder. In the first part of the paper we define asymptotic boundary KZB operators for connected real semisimple Lie groups G with finite center. We prove their main properties algebraically using coordinate versions of Harish-Chandra's radial component map. We show that their commutativity is governed by a system of equations involving coupled versions of classical dynamical Yang-Baxter equations and reflection equations. We use the coordinate radial components maps to introduce a new class of quantum superintegrable systems, called quantum Calogero-Moser spin chains. A quantum Calogero-Moser spin chain is a mixture of a quantum spin Calogero-Moser system associated to the restricted root system of G and an one-dimensional spin chain with two-sided reflecting boundaries. The asymptotic boundary KZB operators provide explicit expressions for its first order quantum Hamiltonians. We also explicitly describe the Schr\"odinger operator.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the point process \begin{align*} \frac{1}{Z_{n}}\prod_{1 \leq j &lt; k \leq n} |e^{i\theta_{j}}+e^{i\theta_{k}}|^{\beta}\prod_{j=1}^{n} d\theta_{j}, \qquad \theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{n} \in (-\pi,\pi], \quad \beta &gt; 0, \end{align*} where $Z_{n}$ is the normalization constant. This point process is attractive: it involves $n$ dependent, uniformly distributed random variables on the unit circle that attract each other. (For comparison, the well-studied C$\beta$E involves $n$ uniformly distributed random variables on the unit circle that repel each other.)
  We consider linear statistics of the form $\sum_{j=1}^{n}g(\theta_{j})$ as $n \to \infty$, where $g\in C^{1,q}$ and $2\pi$-periodic. We prove that the leading order fluctuations around the mean are of order $n$ and given by $\smash{\big(g(U)-\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}g(\theta) \frac{d\theta}{2\pi}}\big)n$, where $U \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(-\pi,\pi]$. We also prove that the subleading fluctuations around the mean are of order $\sqrt{n}$ and of the form $\mathcal{N}_{\mathbb{R}}(0,4g'(U)^{2}/\beta)\sqrt{n}$, i.e. that the subleading fluctuations are given by a Gaussian random variable that itself has a random variance.
  Our proof uses techniques developed by McKay and Isaev [8,6] to obtain asymptotics of related $n$-fold integrals.</description>

      <title>A proof that no-signalling implies microcausality in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study some logical interrelationships between fundamental properties in (relativistic) quantum theories. An operational no-signalling condition is first introduced in the context of quantum mechanics, where we prove its equivalence to an apparently weaker version restricted to ideal measurements, and to a property of factorization of the evolution unitary operator. We then translate this condition in quantum field theory and prove that it implies both microcausality and the spin-statistics theorem, in the ideal case of pointwise measurements implemented in the projection postulate sense. This provides an argument (often invoked but apparently missing in the literature) to see microcausality as a necessary condition for the compatibility of spacelike separated operations.</description>

      <title>The random field Ising chain domain-wall structure in the large interaction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the configurations of the nearest neighbor Ising ferromagnetic chain with IID centered and square integrable external random field in the limit in which the pairwise interaction tends to infinity. The available free energy estimates for this model show a strong form of disorder relevance, i.e., a strong effect of disorder on the free energy behavior, and our aim is to make explicit how the disorder affects the spin configurations. We give a quantitative estimate that shows that the infinite volume spin configurations are close to one explicit disorder dependent configuration when the interaction is large. Our results confirm predictions on this model obtained in D. S. Fisher, P. Le Doussal and C. Monthus (Phys. Rev. E 2001) by applying the renormalization group method introduced by D. S. Fisher (Phys. Rev. B 1995).</description>

      <title>Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems Modeling Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling of real-world physical systems requires the consistent combination of a multitude of physical laws and phenomenological models. This challenging task can be greatly simplified by hierarchically decomposing systems into ultimately simple components. Moreover, the use of diagrams for expressing the decomposition helps make the process more intuitive and facilitates communication, even with non-experts. As an important requirement, models have to respect fundamental physical laws such as the first and the second law of thermodynamics. While some existing modeling frameworks make such guarantees based on structural properties of their models, they lack a formal graphical syntax. We present a compositional and thermodynamically consistent modeling language with a graphical syntax. In terms of its semantics, we essentially endow port-Hamiltonian systems with additional structural properties and a fixed physical interpretation, ensuring thermodynamic consistency in a manner closely related to the metriplectic or GENERIC formalism. While port-Hamiltonian systems are inspired by graphical modeling with bond graphs, neither the link between the two, nor bond graphs themselves, can be easily formalized. In contrast, our syntax is based on a refinement of the well-studied operad of undirected wiring diagrams. By combining a compositional, graphical syntax with an energy-based, thermodynamic approach, the presented modeling language simplifies the understanding, reuse, and modification of complex physical models.</description>

      <title>2-Morita Equivalent Condensable Algebras and Domain Walls in 2+1D Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify $E_2$ condensable algebras in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ up to 2-Morita equivalence. From a physical perspective, this is equivalent to providing a criterion for when different $E_2$ condensable algebras result in the same condensed topological phase in a 2d anyon condensation process. By considering the left and right centers of $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, we exhaust all 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$ and provide a method to recover $E_1$ condensable algebras from 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras. We also prove that intersecting Lagrangian algebras in $\mathcal{C} \boxtimes \overline{\mathcal{C}}$ with its left and right components generates all 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$. This paper establishes a complete interplay between $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, and Lagrangian algebras in $\mathcal{C} \boxtimes \overline{\mathcal{C}}$.
  The relations between different condensable algebras can be translated into their module categories, which correspond to domain walls in topological orders. We introduce a two-step condensation process and study the fusion of domain walls. We also show that an automorphism of an $E_2$ condensable algebra may lead to a nontrivial braided autoequivalence in the condensed phase. As concrete examples, we interpret the categories of quantum doubles of finite groups. We also discuss examples beyond group symmetries. Moreover, our results can be generalized to Witt-equivalent modular tensor categories.</description>

      <title>Gelation in Vector Multiplicative Coalescence and Extinction in Multi-Type Poisson Branching Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present a novel connection between a multi-type (vector) multiplicative coalescent process and a multi-type branching process with Poisson offspring distributions. More specifically, we show that the equations that govern the phenomenon of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process are equivalent to the set of equations that yield the extinction probabilities of the corresponding multi-type Poisson branching process. We then leverage this connection with two applications, one in each direction. The first is a new quick proof of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process, and the second is a new series expression for the extinction probabilities of the multi-type Poisson branching process.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact, spherically symmetric, static solution of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to a self-interacting scalar field. The solution does not exhibit any zero proper volume singularity at the centre, and therefore, curvature scalars are always regular. We study the property of radial null geodesics and derive that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. Notably, it lacks a Schwarzschild limit. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms. It can be seen as a suggestion that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. Additionally, we compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime metric.</description>

      <title>Tensorial free convolution, semicircular, free Poisson and R-transform in high order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work builds on our previous developments regarding a notion of freeness for tensors. We aim to establish a tensorial free convolution for compactly supported measures. First, we define higher-order analogues of the semicircular (or Wigner) law and the free Poisson (or Marcenko-Pastur) law, giving their moments and free cumulants. We prove the convergence of a Wishart-type tensor to the free Poisson law and recall the convergence of a Wigner tensor to the semicircular law. We also present a free Central Limit Theorem in this context. Next, we introduce a tensorial free convolution, define the $R$-transform, and provide the first examples of free convolution of measures.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric type II blowup solutions to the three dimensional Keller-Segel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct axisymmetric solutions to the three-dimensional parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system that blows up in finite time. In particular, the singularity is of type II, which admits locally a leading order profile of the rescaled stationary solution of the two-dimensional system. Additionally, mass concentration occurs along a one-dimensional ring in the plane. In the analysis, we rely on an approximate solution of the eigenproblem associated with the linearized operator around the stationary solution as well as the modulation dynamics to control the perturbation function and derive the accurate blowup rate.</description>
