      <title>Competing Supramolecular Structures: Dielectric and Rheological Spectroscopy on Glycerol/Propanol Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding the dynamics of pure hydrogen-bonded systems by analyzing the spectral shape of various susceptibilities. Monohydroxy- and polyalcohols are currently considered to form transient supramolecular hydrogen-bonded structures in the form of chains, rings, and networks. This complex dynamic behavior has been identified in network-forming glycerol and chain-forming propanol by combining dielectric and light-scattering spectra. We apply these concepts to study the combined dielectric and shear rheological spectral shape of glycerol/propanol mixtures. Glycerol differs from propanol by having two additional hydroxy groups, which leads to significant differences in melting temperatures($\Delta T_{\textbf{m}}$\,=\,291\,K\,-\,147\,K\,=\,143\,K) and glass transition temperatures ($\Delta T_{\textbf{g}}$\,=\,190\,K-\,98\,K\,=\,92\,K). The strong difference results in two distinct calorimetric glass transitions at a molar glycerol concentration of $\chi_{gly}=0.3$, as well as a change in the shear modulus $G_{\infty}$ between $\chi_{gly}=0.5$ and 0.7. Performing a comprehensive analysis of the three applied experimental techniques leads to the conclusion that dielectric spectroscopy monitors the evolution of supramolecular chain and network structures and that the mechanical properties depend heavily on the formed hydrogen-bonded network. A strong dynamical heterogeneity is observed and manifests itself in two distinguishable glass transitions in dielectric spectroscopy and calorimetry. The presented chain/network mixture is dynamically highly heterogeneous when compared to the rather narrow dynamical heterogeneity in the network/network mixture Water/Glycerol.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Potentials for Efficient Simulations of Anisotropic Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating interactions between non-spherical colloidal particles is computationally challenging due to the complex dependency of forces and energies on their geometry. We introduce and evaluate both descriptor-based and end-to-end models for predicting interaction energies and forces. Then, we compare various descriptors coupled with different regression models, like Behler-Parinello descriptors, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, and neuroevolution potential, as well as multiple end-to-end models, namely SchNet, DimeNet, and DimeNet++. Among these, the neuroevolution potential (NEP) offers an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. NEP, originally developed for atomistic systems, represents interactions between rigid anisotropic bodies using point clouds, which enables the representation of any arbitrary shape. Molecular dynamics simulations using NEP, accurately reproduced structural properties across diverse particle shapes including cubes, tetrahedra, pentagonal bipyramids, and twisted cylinders, while achieving roughly up to an order-of-magnitude speedup over other methods. Additionally, we show that the extension of the method to multi-face shapes with different interactions on their surface is straightforward. We used a twisted cylinder, which lacked any point group symmetry, to demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of NEP. Our approach enables scalable simulations of complex colloidal systems and can potentially help to facilitate efficient studies on shape dependent interactions and phase behavior in the future.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of gravitactic chiral active Brownian particles in an asymmetric channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion of micro- and nano-swimmers in a fluid, confined within irregular structures that impose entropic barriers, is often modeled using overdamped active Brownian dynamics, where viscous effects are paramount and inertia is negligible. Here, we numerically investigate the diffusive behavior of chiral self-propelled particles in a two-dimensional asymmetric channel subjected to an external torque arising from a gravitational field. We reveal the emergence of resonant diffusion when the external torque $\omega$ approaches the intrinsic angular velocity $\omega_{0}$ of particles. This resonance manifests as a pronounced accumulation of particles near the upper-left corner of the channel, accompanied by an enhanced peak in the effective diffusion coefficient. In particular, it is observed only for low rotational diffusion rates and does not persist beyond moderate values of $\omega_{0}$. Prominent transport features, such as rectification at low values of $\omega$, a monotonic increase in average velocity with $\omega$, and a nonmonotonic response of transport characteristics (average velocity and effective diffusion coefficient) as a function of the rotational diffusion rate near the resonance point, are explained. Furthermore, we show that the transport characteristics depend strongly on the aspect ratio of the channel. For instance, the enhanced diffusion peak becomes more pronounced with increasing aspect ratio, and the average velocity saturates at higher values for wider bottleneck openings. It is conceivable that these findings have a great potential for developing microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip devices for particle separation, targeted drug delivery, and advanced active materials.</description>

      <title>Ring polymers in two-dimensional melts double-fold around randomly branching "primitive shapes"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the concept of the "primitive path" of a linear chain in melt conditions, we introduce here a numerical protocol which allows us to detect, in an unambiguous manner, the "primitive shapes" of ring polymers in two-dimensional melts. Then, by analysing the conformational properties of these primitive shapes, we demonstrate that they conform to the statistics of two-dimensional branched polymers (or, trees) in the same melt conditions, in agreement with seminal theoretical work by Khokhlov, Nechaev and Rubinstein. Results for polymer dynamics in light of the branched nature of the rings are also presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Bacteria collective motion is scale-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming bacteria interact hydrodynamically over long ranges, organizing themselves into collective states that drive large-scale chaotic flows, often referred to as "bacterial turbulence". Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work, it remains unclear whether an intrinsic length scale underlies the observed patterns. To shed light on the mechanism driving active turbulence, we investigate the emergence of large-scale flows in E. coli suspensions confined within cylindrical chambers, systematically varying confinement height over more than two orders of magnitude. We first demonstrate that the critical density for the onset of collective motion scales inversely with this confinement height without saturation, even for the smallest densities observed. Near the onset, both the observed length and time scales increase sharply, with the length scale bounded only by the vertical confinement. Importantly, both scales exhibit clear power-law dependence on the confinement height, demonstrating the absence of an intrinsic length scale in bacterial collective motion. This holds up to scales nearly 10,000 times the size of a single bacterium, as evidenced by transient coherent vortices spanning the full chamber width near the onset. Our experimental results demonstrating that bacterial turbulence is scale-free provide important constraints for theories aiming to capture the dynamics of wet active matter.</description>

      <title>Cell clusters sense their global shape to drive collective migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective migration of epithelial groups of cells plays a central role in processes such as embryo development, wound healing, and cancer invasion. While finite cell clusters are known to collectively migrate in response to external gradients, the competing effect of possible endogenous cues is largely unknown.Here, we demonstrate that the polarization of peripheral cells that pull the cluster's edge outward is sufficient to induce and sustain the collective migration of confluent clusters. We use a general continuum model to show that the underlying shape-sensing mechanism is purely mechanical, relying on long-range hydrodynamic interactions and cell-cell alignment forces. As a proof-of-concept, we validate our findings with experiments on monolayer clusters from various cell lines, where we control initial shapes and sizes. The mechanism operates independently of external signals and will generally interfere with them. Specifically, we predict and observe experimentally that it can override collective durotaxis, reversing the direction of migration. Together, our results offer a physical framework for understanding how cell interactions govern the interplay between global shape and collective motion and afford engineering principles for optimal control and manipulation of cell cluster shape and motion.</description>

      <title>Contact line friction of bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact line friction (CLF) of bubbles is ubiquitous, from bubbles on a beer glass to H2 bubbles sliding over electrodes in electrolysis. However, a fundamental understanding of CLF of bubbles is still missing, mainly due to the challenge of precisely controlling bubble sliding. For example, it is not clear how bubbles start sliding and how CLF of bubbles depends on velocity. We therefore developed a bubble friction force instrument to directly measure bubble CLF. This force develops from a static regime, through a transition, to a kinetic regime. This entire process is quantitatively described by a modified Kawasaki-Furmidge equation. Bubble CLF was measured for velocities from 0.2 micron/s to 2 mm/s, revealing a transition from a constant CLF regime below about 60 micron/s to a velocity-dependent CLF regime on surfaces with various wettability. The velocity dependence stems from interfacial adaptation governed by the liquid ionic environment with a relaxation time of around 10 microsecond. Moreover, CLF of bubbles can be measured on hydrophilic surfaces and under a challenging H2 atmosphere, overcoming the limitations of current droplet-based methods. Our results provide a quantitative basis for understanding CLF of bubbles with relevance to many applications, including bubble manipulation and electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>A Modified Landau-de Gennes Theory for Smectic Liquid Crystals: Phase Transitions and Structural Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We mathematically model Smectic-A (SmA) phases with a modified Landau-de Gennes (mLdG) model. The orientational order of the SmA phase is described by a tensor-order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$, and the positional order is described by a real scalar $u$, which models the deviation from the average density of liquid crystal molecules. Firstly, we prove the existence and regularity of global minimisers of the mLdG free energy in three-dimensional settings. Then, we analytically prove that the mLdG model can capture the Isotropic-Nematic-Smectic phase transition as a function of temperature, under some assumptions. Further, we explore stable smectic phases on a square domain, with edge length $\lambda$, and tangent boundary conditions. We use heuristic arguments to show that defects repel smectic layers and strong nematic ordering promotes layer formation. We use asymptotic arguments in the $\lambda\to 0$ and $\lambda\to\infty$ limits which reveal the correlation between the number and thickness of smectic layers, the amplitude of density fluctuations with the phenomenological parameters in the mLdG energy. For finite values of $\lambda$, we numerically recover BD-like and D-like stable smectic states observed in experiments. We also study the frustrated mLdG energy landscape and give numerical examples of transition pathways between distinct mLdG energy minimisers.</description>

      <title>Packing3D.jl: An open-source analytical framework for computing packing density and mixing indices using partial spherical volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of local packing density and mixing in simulations of particulate systems is essential for many industrial applications. Traditional methods which simply count the number of particle centres within a given volume of space (cell) introduce discontinuities at cell boundaries, leading to unreliable measurements of packing density. We introduce Packing3D.jl, an open-source Julia package providing analytic partial-volume calculations for spheres intersecting Cartesian and cylindrical meshes. We derive closed-form solutions for single, double and triple spherical-cap intersections, plus sphere-cylinder overlaps. We implement efficient mesh-generation routines, principal-cell indexing, and data-splitting functions for time-series analyses. Performance and accuracy were validated against simple cubic and face-centred cubic lattices and via boundary-shift continuity tests. Packing3D.jl converges exactly to theoretical lattice densities, eliminates discontinuities at sub-particle resolution, and scales linearly with particle count. Memory usage remains modest (40 B per particle, 48 B per cell). Packing3D.jl provides researchers with continuous, reproducible volume-fraction fields and robust mixing indices at high performance, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimisation in granular process engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When dissolved, weak electrolytes only partially dissociate into ions in a temperature-dependent process. We show herein that such incomplete dissociation yields an enormous thermoelectric response in an electrolyte-filled nanochannel along which a temperature gradient is applied. For this purpose, an extended version of the Nernst-Planck equations is developed that takes into account the temperature-dependent dissociation-association equilibrium. The results indicate that in this way, Seebeck coefficients can be achieved that outperform all previously reported values.</description>

Abstract: Recently published preprint (A. Ashkinazi, H.Chhabra, A.El.Moumane, M.M.C.Tortora, J.P.K. Doye, Chirality transfer in lyotropic twist-bend nematics, arXiv:2508.03544v1 (2025)) has reawakened also interest to various mechanisms of chirality transfer from microscopic (molecular) level into the macroscopic chirality of the structure. In this communication we present a simple theoretical analysis how the transfer occurs for the Landau model of phase transition between cholesteric and chiral twist-bend liquid crystals. We found that the sign of the chiral heliconical spiral is always opposite to that of the cholesteric. Physics behind this relation is based on the orthogonality of the cholesteric director and vector order parameter of the heliconical phase.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced non-reciprocal magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>Is Triboelectricity Confusing, Confused or Complex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.</description>
