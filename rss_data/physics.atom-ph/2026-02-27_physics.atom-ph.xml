      <title>Stabilization of Rydberg Dissipative Time Crystals Using a Scanning Fabry Perot Interferometer Transfer Lock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilization of laser frequencies is critical for sensitive Rydberg measurements, including in applications such as dissipative time crystal (DTC) dynamics, yet conventional approaches often require complex or costly hardware. We demonstrate a compact, low cost stabilization method using a scanning Fabry Perot interferometer (SFPI) to transfer lock a 960nm coupler laser to an 852nm probe. The lock suppresses coupler multi MHz free running drift and improves the Allan deviation by up to an order of magnitude, reaching &lt;75kHz at 66s. Applied to DTC oscillations using a Rb 2 photon D2 transition, the second harmonic generated 480nm (from 960nm lock) reduces DTC frequency drift from &gt;20kHz to a few kHz and lowers instability by more than an order of magnitude with a minimum Allan deviation of 0.2kHz at &lt;10s. These results establish SFPI-based transfer locking as a practical and accurate approach for scalable multi laser Rydberg experiments requiring long-term stability in a compact and low cost system.</description>

      <title>Full Single-Quantum Control of Particles in Penning Traps for Symmetry Tests at the Quantum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BASE collaboration aims to measure antimatter systems with the highest precision in order to perform a rigorous test of CPT symmetry and search for physics beyond the Standard Model. As part of the BASE collaboration, we pursue the development of quantum logic inspired cooling and detection techniques for g-factor measurements of (anti-)protons. Implementing these methods requires full quantum-level control of individual antimatter particles confined in cryogenic Penning traps. By mapping the (anti-)proton's internal state onto a co-trapped 9Be+ "logic" ion via free Coulomb coupling in a double-well potential, we can accelerate measurement cycles and push g-factor precision measurements on (anti-)protons toward the quantum limit. Here, we present an overview of the proposed method and the current status of the project, with special emphasis on the new cryogenic multi-Penning-trap stack and the proton detection system.</description>

      <title>Optical repumping and atom number balancing in a two-color MOT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a novel repumping transition for $^{88}$Sr atoms trapped in a 'blue' magneto-optical trap. We show that, while the repumping efficiency is about three orders of magnitude smaller than for traditional schemes, it is sufficient for recycling all atoms, provided the repumping laser beams are arranged to form a 'green' magneto- optical trap (MOT) helping to cool and confine the atoms and preventing their loss. Our main findings are: (i) that the green MOT configuration is able to trap 10 times more atoms in the blue MOT than using the green transition merely as a repump, and (ii) that the atom numbers in the two-color MOT can be balanced through experimental control parameters. The interest of this scheme lies in its capability of reaching low temperature and its suitability for continuous atomic beam generation.</description>

      <title>Robustness-Runtime Tradeoff for Quantum State Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer is the primitive of transporting an unknown state on one site of a lattice to another. Using power-law interactions, recent state transfer protocols achieve speedup by utilizing the intermediate ancilla sites. However, these protocols require the ancillas to be in a perfectly initialized state, which, due to noise or imperfect control, may not be the case. In this work we introduce the $\textit{robustness}$ of a state transfer protocol, which quantifies the protocol's tolerance to error in the initial ancilla state. In the Heisenberg picture, state transfer grows operators supported on the final site such that they no longer commute with all operators on the starting site. We prove that this robustness tightly bounds the Schatten $p$-norms of these commutators between initial and final-site operators. This generalizes the known cases of $p=\infty$ and $p=2$, which govern completely state-dependent and state-independent state transfer respectively, demonstrating that intermediate values of $p$ govern partially state-dependent state transfer. In conjunction with existing power-law light cones, our result gives new minimum runtimes for partially state-dependent protocols which, in certain regimes, are parametrically better than existing bounds. We introduce new robust state transfer protocols, charting the landscape between complete state-dependence and state-independence.</description>

      <title>Controlled symmetry breaking of the Fermi surface in ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions between ultracold polar molecules are predicted to drive exotic quantum phases, yet direct many-body signatures of these interactions in degenerate Fermi gases have remained elusive. Here, we report the observation of an interaction-induced controlled deformation of the Fermi surface, providing a clear many-body signature in a deeply degenerate Fermi gas of $^{23}\text{Na}^{40}\text{K}$ molecules. Using double microwave (MW) shielding, we prepare $8 \times 10^3$ molecules at $0.23(1)$ times the Fermi temperature, achieving a three-fold suppression of inelastic losses compared to single MW shielding while preserving strong elastic dipolar scattering. We observe Fermi surface deformations of up to $7\,\%$, more than two times larger than those observed in magnetic atoms, despite operating at two orders of magnitude lower densities. Crucially, we demonstrate continuous tuning of the interaction potential from axial U(1) to biaxial C$_{2}$ symmetry, directly imprinting this geometry onto the Fermi surface. We find excellent agreement between our experimental results and parameter-free Hartree-Fock theory. These results establish MW-shielded polar molecules as a highly tunable platform for exploring strongly correlated dipolar Fermi matter and offer a promising path towards topological superfluidity.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in atoms and electron scattering revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchange by two neutrinos (as well as by other fermions) generates a long-range parity-violating (PV) potential of the form $\sim G^2/r^5$, with characteristic range $\hbar/(2m_{\nu}c)$. This interaction produces a $-0.8\%$ correction to the effective weak charge of the Cs atom, thereby resolving the $2\sigma$ discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction and the Cs PV measurement, and yielding $\sin^2\theta_W=0.2375(19)$ at $q^2\approx0$ (to be compared with the Standard Model value $\sin^2\theta_W=0.2387$). We derive updated limits on an extra $Z'$ boson and obtain a constraint on isospin-conserving oblique radiative corrections characterized by the Peskin--Takeuchi parameter, $S=-0.32(53)$ at $q^2\approx0$. The corresponding relative correction to the proton weak charge is $3\%$, and a similar correction is expected for the electron weak charge.</description>

      <title>The MARTINI Platform (I): Se I-X atomic calculation and expansion opacity for early-stage kilonova spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kilonovae represent key sites of r-process nucleosynthesis, making opacity estimation and spectral analysis crucial for constraining their composition. Since light r-process elements shape the early ($\sim$0.5-1.5$\mathrm{d}$) ejecta opacity, a detailed study of the selenium element with a focus on atomic data calculation, expansion opacity estimation and spectral analysis is presented. Se atomic data are calculated from Se I to Se X using the GRASP2018 code. A systematic analysis and evaluation of their precision is performed through detailed comparison with the NIST ASD, and other works available in the literature. These atomic data are then used to estimate expansion opacity at different temperatures (e.g., T=5000 K, 10000 K, 20000 K, 100000 K) and densities (e.g., $\rho = 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}},\,3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$). Spectral analysis has been performed with radiative transfer code POSSIS with a pre-computed opacity grid calculated with new densities and temperatures, ranging from -19.5 to -4.5 $\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$ in log-scale and from 1 000 to 51 000 K, respectively. Two scenarios are considered: one in which the opacity contribution comes from 100\% Se ejecta, and another in which Se contributes only partially to the total opacity ($\sim$ 10\% of the total mass). Se atomic calculations show a good agreement with NIST ASD, with accurate energy levels and transitions determined alongside atomic data for higher ionisation stages not fully covered by NIST. The expansion opacities calculated with these new Se data exhibit differences in comparison to existing literature works. Se spectral features can only be observed in the KN scenario consisting of 100\% Se. When Se accounts for about 10\% of the total KN mass, these features become undetectable. All Se results are now available in the new open-source MARTINI platform dedicated to element nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>A Maxwell Fish-Eye Lens in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally realize an analogue of the optical Maxwell fish-eye lens (MFEL) using phononic excitations in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). A MFEL is characterized by a radially symmetric, spatially varying refractive index with the remarkable property that rays emitted from any point within the lens are perfectly focused at their image points. While the implementation of such gradient-index lenses is challenging in conventional optical systems, BECs offer a highly tunable platform in which the spatially varying speed of sound of collective excitations -- phonons, the acoustic-wave analogues of photons -- can be engineered and their dynamics observed in real time. Time-resolved measurements of phonon wavefronts reveal focusing behavior that shows good agreement with analytical theory and numerical simulations. This work provides both a geometric and physical framework for engineering effective refractive indices using ultracold atoms, and simulating wave propagation on effective spherical geometries.</description>

      <title>Polarization-selective quantum cooperative response in dual-species atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum light-matter interfaces, yet single-species arrays are constrained by in-plane symmetry, restricting polarization control. Here we investigate the cooperative optical response of dual-species subwavelength atom arrays, in which intrinsic polarizability difference breaks in-plane symmetry. By engineering the lattice spacing and detunings, the arrays exhibit polarization-dependent subradiant modes, enabling complete reflection of specific polarization component. Leveraging this mechanism, we assemble array units as functional pixels and demonstrate a scalable polarization-selective quantum light modulator. Our work establishes a dynamically reconfigurable atomic-photonic platform for versatile subwavelength quantum optical elements.</description>

      <title>Restricted-Geometry Quantum Models Beyond Atoms: Application of the Eckhardt-Sacha approach to NSDI in Diatomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a (1+1)-dimensional quantum model designed to describe nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) in homonuclear diatomic molecules exposed to strong linearly polarized laser fields. Extending the restricted-geometry framework previously developed for atomic systems by Eckhardt and Sacha, our approach captures key features of NSDI, including the characteristic knee structure in double ionization yields. Despite its simplifying assumptions, the model shows good agreement with experimental data and proves particularly suitable for systems with $\sigma$-type orbital symmetry. It offers a computationally efficient tool for exploring multi-electron dynamics in molecular systems.</description>
