      <title>Ovi: Twin Backbone Cross-Modal Fusion for Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules, Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate, context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips. All the demos, code and model weights are published at https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi</description>

      <title>Comparing Contrastive and Triplet Loss in Audio-Visual Embedding: Intra-Class Variance and Greediness Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive loss and triplet loss are widely used objectives in deep metric learning, yet their effects on representation quality remain insufficiently understood. We present a theoretical and empirical comparison of these losses, focusing on intra- and inter-class variance and optimization behavior (e.g., greedy updates). Through task-specific experiments with consistent settings on synthetic data and real datasets-MNIST, CIFAR-10-it is shown that triplet loss preserves greater variance within and across classes, supporting finer-grained distinctions in the learned representations. In contrast, contrastive loss tends to compact intra-class embeddings, which may obscure subtle semantic differences. To better understand their optimization dynamics, By examining loss-decay rate, active ratio, and gradient norm, we find that contrastive loss drives many small updates early on, while triplet loss produces fewer but stronger updates that sustain learning on hard examples. Finally, across both classification and retrieval tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and CARS196 datasets, our results consistently show that triplet loss yields superior performance, which suggests using triplet loss for detail retention and hard-sample focus, and contrastive loss for smoother, broad-based embedding refinement.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quality Metric for Video Frame Interpolation Based on Motion-Field Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application. We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180 sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods) shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric is available at www.github.com/conalld/psnr-div.</description>

      <title>TalkPlay-Tools: Conversational Music Recommendation with LLM Tool Calling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have successfully enabled generative recommenders with natural language interactions, their recommendation behavior is limited, leaving other simpler yet crucial components such as metadata or attribute filtering underutilized in the system. We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Audio-Enhanced Vision-Language Modeling with Latent Space Broadening for High Quality Data Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based multimodal models are widely used in industrial-scale recommendation, search, and advertising systems for content understanding and relevance ranking. Enhancing labeled training data quality and cross-modal fusion significantly improves model performance, influencing key metrics such as quality view rates and ad revenue. High-quality annotations are crucial for advancing content modeling, yet traditional statistical-based active learning (AL) methods face limitations: they struggle to detect overconfident misclassifications and are less effective in distinguishing semantically similar items in deep neural networks. Additionally, audio information plays an increasing role, especially in short-video platforms, yet most pre-trained multimodal architectures primarily focus on text and images. While training from scratch across all three modalities is possible, it sacrifices the benefits of leveraging existing pre-trained visual-language (VL) and audio models. To address these challenges, we propose kNN-based Latent Space Broadening (LSB) to enhance AL efficiency and Vision-Language Modeling with Audio Enhancement (VLMAE), a mid-fusion approach integrating audio into VL models. This system deployed in production systems, leading to significant business gains.</description>

      <title>SpeechWeave: Diverse Multilingual Synthetic Text &amp; Audio Data Generation Pipeline for Training Text to Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization. Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges, we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity, normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.</description>
