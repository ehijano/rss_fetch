      <title>Chiral Quantum Optics with Scalable Quantum Dot Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable method for electrically tuning multiple spatially separated quantum dots embedded in photonic crystal waveguides. Ion implantation into the top p-doped layer of a p-i-n diode creates high-resistivity tracks, providing electrical isolation between adjacent regions. Unlike physical etching, this method preserves the guided-mode profile of the photonic crystal without introducing significant scattering, limiting refractive index perturbations to below 0.001 with 0.01% additional loss. In contrast, physical etching can reduce single-band transmission by more than 30% for an etch width of 100 nm. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using quantum dots embedded in a glideplane photonic crystal waveguide, controlling the detuning between different spin-state combinations of two highly chiral quantum dots coupled to the same mode. Second-order photon correlation measurements provide a sensitive probe of the chirality-dependent photon statistics, which are in good agreement with a waveguide-QED master equation model. Our results mark an important step towards scalable, multi-emitter architectures for chiral quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Effective SU(2) gadget: holonomic walk on higher-order Poincar\'{e} sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a manner commensurate to the SU(2) gadget for the Poincar\'{e} sphere, which involves a combination of two quarter-wave plates and one half-wave plate regardless of their sequential order, an analogous construct for the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere had long remained elusive. To address this, we recently demonstrated, by modifying Euler-angle parameterization, that an optical gadget consisting of two quarter-wave $q$-plates and one half-wave $q$-plate, each endowed with the same topological charge $q$, operates as a viable SU(2) gadget for the higher-order Poincar\'{e} sphere, contingent upon the fulfillment of the holonomy condition. This work presents the controlled navigation on the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere through the proposed architecture, formulated under the concept of an effective waveplate and thus can be referred to as an effective SU(2) gadget. The notion of an effective waveplate refers to a coaxial arrangement of multiple waveplates that, under specific constraints, can act as a single waveplate. In this gadget, the relative alignment of the offset angles of the constituent $q$-plates emerges as the decisive parameter governing systematic navigation on the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere. This study bear direct relevance to the deterministic control and engineering of structured light, encompassing polarization singularities, vector vortex beams and topological optical fields. Moreover, these results holds potential applications in the contemporary research frontiers in singular optics, spin-orbit photonics and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Tracking of Persistent, Localized Speckles in Turbulent Atmospheric Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light propagation through turbulence produces speckles, whose ensemble behavior is typically characterized by snapshot intensity statistics. Here, we track the spatiotemporal evolution of individual speckles and quantify fragmentation, localization, and persistence under different diffraction and turbulence scales. Beam fragmentation coincides with complete spatial decorrelation defined by the magnitude-squared coherence. Fragmentation occurs closer to the source for larger beams, which indicates that smaller beams are more robust to decoherence. Subsequently, speckles are both spatially localized and persistent over distances significantly longer than their associated Rayleigh length. The combination of localization and persistence impacts the statistics of light relevant to their long-distance signaling and sensing.</description>

      <title>Dual slow-light enhanced photothermal gas spectroscopy on a silicon chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic sensors have attracted significant attention recently for their potential for high-density integration. However, they face challenges in sensing gases with high sensitivity due to weak light-gas interaction. Slow light, which dramatically intensifies light-matter interaction through spatial compression of optical energy, provides a promising solution. Herein, we demonstrate a dual slow-light scheme for enhancing the sensitivity of photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) with a suspended photonic crystal waveguide (PhCW) on a CMOS-compatible silicon platform. By tailoring the dispersion of the PhCW to generate structural slow light to enhance pump absorption and probe phase modulation, we achieve a photothermal efficiency of 3.6x10-4 rad cm ppm-1 mW-1 m-1, over 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than the strip waveguides and optical fibers. With a 1-mm-long sensing PhCW incorporated in a stabilized on-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a footprint of 0.6 mm2, we demonstrate acetylene detection with a sensitivity of 1.4x10-6 in terms of noise-equivalent absorption and length product (NEAL), the best among the reported photonic waveguide gas sensors to our knowledge. The dual slow-light enhanced PTS paves the way for integrated photonic gas sensors with high sensitivity, miniaturization, and cost-effective mass production.</description>

      <title>Visible Integrated Photonics with Tantalum Pentoxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid photonic platforms are essential for integrating light sources with scalable on-chip optical circuits. Here, we demonstrate that tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) on insulator is a promising photonic material for such applications, supporting high-Q resonator architectures operating in the visible spectral range. The deposition process of Ta2O5 was optimized by examining the influence of oxygen flow on film stoichiometry during electron beam evaporation. High quality ring resonators (Q&gt;10000) coupled to bus waveguides were fabricated and measured. Furthermore, we realised a hybrid Ta2O5 - hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) photonic device in which ensembles of B-centre defects were generated and preserved throughout fabrication. These results establish a robust material framework for the integration of defect-based quantum emitters with low-loss dielectric photonics.</description>

      <title>Silicon-photonic optomechanical magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical sensors enable exquisitely sensitive force measurements, with emerging applications across quantum technologies, standards, fundamental science, and engineering. Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration.</description>

      <title>Supercontinuum Generation in the Low-Peak-Power Regime Using a Single-Stage Multipass Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a single-stage multipass cell (MPC) compressor driven directly by a 500 nJ, 5 W, 120 fs, 10 MHz oscillator that delivers efficient spectral broadening from 800 to 1200 nm with &gt;75% transmission. The compressed pulses approach the Fourier limit (FTL) of 8.1 fs, representing, to the best of our knowledge, the first realization of supercontinuum (SC) generation and compression in a single-stage MPC at such low, MW-level, input peak power. This compact, high-repetition-rate source holds strong potential for multiphoton microscopy and coherent Raman imaging.</description>

      <title>The effect of discrete-time evolution on thermalisation in a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles subject to weak contact interactions in a finite-size lattice tend to thermalise. The Hamiltonian evolution ensures energy conservation and the final temperature is fully determined by the initial conditions. In this work we show that equilibration processes are radically different in lattices subject to discrete-step unitary evolution, which have been implemented in photonic circuits, coin polarisation walkers and time-multiplexed pulses in fibres. Using numerical simulations, we show that weak nonlinearities lead to an equilibrium state of equal modal occupation across all the bands, i.e, a thermal state with infinite temperature and chemical potential. This state is reached no matter the initial distribution of modes and independent of the bands dispersions and gaps. We show that by engineering the temporal periodicity inherent to these systems, equilibration can be accelerated through resonant Floquet channels. Our results demonstrate that discrete time plays a crucial role in wave dynamics, fundamentally altering thermalisation processes within weak wave turbulence theory.</description>

      <title>Reply to "Comment on Brilliant source of 19.2 attosecond soft X-ray pulses below the atomic unit of time" by Han (arXiv:2510.17949)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently reported a refine analysis of a previously conducted soft X-ray (SXR) attosecond streaking measurement [1], employing the Variational Phase Gradient Temporal Analysis (VPGTA) retreival algorithm [2]. This re-evaluation, prompted by new metrological insights, revealed a 19.2 attosecond pulse - consistent with the expectations and estimates of our earlier work [3]. Shortly thereafter, a comment by M. Han [4] challenged our findings, citing "physical and technical issues concerning the original experiment and the new characterisation" inclusing purported contributions from Auger electrons, unfiltered low-energy harmonics, and uncompensated intrinsic chirp. These concerns, however, stem from misinterpretation of the experimental regime, selective citation of context, and disregard for well-established results in the peer-reviewed literature. In this reply, we address and clarify these points, demonstrating that the issues raised are not relevant under our experimental conditions. Given the highly specialized nature of attosecond genertaion and metrology in the soft X-ray water-window regime, we consider it essential to clarify these aspects of different regimes and reaffirm teh validity of our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Direct experimental access to the bulk band inversion in a topological metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases in exciton-polaritons and other metamaterial platforms have attracted significant attention due to their flexibility as Hamiltonian simulators. In previous works, signatures of topology have mainly been investigated from the perspective of edge states - strongly localised modes with exponentially decaying intensity into the bulk. While these edge states have become the hallmark of topological systems as they can facilitate non-reciprocal transport in potential applications, the topology is fundamentally encoded in the bulk band structure. In particular, the momentum-dependence of the eigenstates, i.e., the wave functions, determines the topology, usually reflected in a bulk band inversion. We present a band inversion in the paradigmatic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, characterised by a reversal of the sublattice symmetry, quantified by the expectation value $\langle \sigma_\mathrm{x} \rangle$, when going from the centre of the Brillouin zone to the zone boundary. Here, we show direct experimental access to this bulk band inversion in SSH exciton-polariton chains, using two-dimensional momentum-space ($k$-space) mapping - without the need for real-space imaging. This technique enables the direct observation of the momentum-dependent inversion of the sublattice symmetry in the bulk bands, providing a unique perspective on topological phases beyond conventional edge state measurements. Our approach establishes effective momentum-resolved sublattice phase measurements as a powerful tool for accessing the wave function and bulk topology in photonic and polaritonic systems and beyond.</description>

      <title>High harmonic spectroscopy reveals anisotropy of the Mott to Charge-Density-Wave phase transition in TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the use of polarization-resolved high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy to investigate the quantum phases and transitions in the correlated charge density wave (CDW) phase of TiSe$_2$. Unlike previous studies focusing on crystallographic changes, the research examines the reordering that occurs within the CDW phase as the material is cooled from room temperature to 14 K. By linking ultrafast field-driven dynamics to the material's potential landscape, the study demonstrates how HHG is sensitive to quantum phase transitions. The findings reveal an anisotropic component below the CDW transition temperature, providing new insights into the nature of this phase. The investigation highlights the interplay between linear and nonlinear optical responses and their departure from simple perturbative dynamics, offering a fresh perspective on correlated quantum phases in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Angular Patterns of Photoluminescence in Quantum Dot Spherical Superparticles Mediated by Whispering-Gallery Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dot superparticles are a specific class of metamaterials created through the self-assembly of nanometer semiconductor quantum dots into organized micro-scale structures, such as microspheres. Superparticles exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electronic properties. These properties are not merely the sum of the constituent quantum dots but rather bear the signature of the collective behavior of the nanoscale building blocks. In particular, assembling an ensemble of quantum dots into a super-sphere allows them to function as a single, high-quality optical resonator. This structure efficiently confines the emission from the pump-excited quantum dots via whispering gallery modes. The emissive properties of such a superparticle resonator remain an area of active investigation. Using numerical simulation, we study the angular structure of the photoluminescence from superparticles of various sizes and architectures formed from CdS quantum dots. We show that, in general, the angular distribution of the SP emission is characterized by strong asymmetry, with a maximum in the backward direction relative to the incident pump beam. In contrast, this asymmetry is virtually absent in the forward and side-scattering directions. The excitation of resonant modes in the superparticle enhances the emission intensity and reduces the degree of its backward asymmetry. Furthermore, coating the CdS quantum dot particle with a silicon dioxide layer increases the probability of exciting field resonances in such a core-shell superparticle.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum correlations from joint pump and photon pair scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering of non-classical light is enabling new ways to study and control photon transport. However, advances in this field often rely on simplifying assumptions regarding the quantum light's generation and its source. In this work, we relax some of these assumptions and probe the behavior of entangled photon pairs passing through a disordered layer after being generated by a randomly scattered pump via spontaneous parametric down conversion. We experimentally demonstrate that, even when both the pump and the down-converted photons propagate through a dynamic scattering medium, the pairs maintain a sharp peak in their correlations. A comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis shows that these correlations persist regardless of when the pairs are generated, whether immediately after the pump is scattered or under other conditions. More specifically, we detail how the shape of the angular correlation depends on the pump's scattering and how it varies with the distance between the pair-generation region and the entrance of the disordered medium. These findings represent a crucial step toward understanding quantum light generation in complex media, and potentially exploiting it for quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate carrier-envelope-phase (CEP)-controlled photocurrents in mono-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS$_2$ driven by few-cycle laser pulses. The photocurrent in the two-terminal devices scales quadratically with the field amplitude, indicating perturbative carrier dynamics in the weak-field regime distinct from strong-field tunnelling. Our results extend light-field-sensitive current control from bulk dielectrics, semiconductors, and graphene to two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, highlighting their potential for electric-field sensitive optoelectronics.</description>

Abstract: Following the ultrafast photoexcitation of a semiconductor, it embodies competing dynamics among photocarriers, many-body transient states of highly energetic excitons, and electron-hole liquid. Here, we show that femtosecond optical pulse excitation induces transient excitonic shift current contributing to stronger THz emission from a single crystalline bulk MoS2 at low temperatures. The control of dominating excitonic shift current is elucidated from excitation density dependent experiments at varying temperatures. A strong decrease in the excitonic contribution beyond a critical fluence of 150microJ/cm^2 is observed at a very low temperature of 20K. This behavior suggests the formation of a new quantum condensate, i.e., the electron-hole liquid, in the regime when the exciton density is overwhelmingly large that the average spacing between exciton pairs is comparable to the exciton radius. Furthermore, the exciton density dependent THz emission at varying temperatures is consistent with the Varshni model and the crystal Debye temperature of 260K.</description>

      <title>Beyond critical coupling: optimal design considerations for spontaneous four-wave mixing in microring resonators</title>

Abstract: We present a self-contained analytical model for biphoton generation in microring resonators. Encompassing both all-pass and add-drop geometries, identical and distinct pump and biphoton coupling coefficients, and continuous-wave and pulsed pumping, our interaction-picture-based approach reveals time-frequency biphoton correlations while also predicting absolute generation rates. Under continuous-wave excitation, we find critical coupling of both the pump and biphoton to maximize the rate of single photons extracted from the microring, whereas critical coupling of the pump but overcoupling of the biphoton maximize the two-photon rate. Under pulsed pumping, overcoupling of both pump and biphoton (to different degrees) maximizes photon extraction probabilities, albeit under a tradeoff with spectral factorability that we quantify via parameter scans over a range of coupler pairings. As a whole, our formalism should prove valuable for the practical design of integrated photon sources, merging a flexible and intuitive biphoton-centric depiction with quantitative predictions closely tied to experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>PrometheusFree: Concurrent Detection of Laser Fault Injection Attacks in Optical Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Silicon Photonics-based AI Accelerators (SPAAs) have been considered as promising AI accelerators achieving high energy efficiency and low latency. While many researchers focus on improving SPAAs' energy efficiency and latency, their physical security has only recently received attention. While it is essential to deliver strong optical neural network inferencing approaches, their success and adoption are predicated on their ability to deliver a secure execution environment. Towards this end, this paper proposes PrometheusFree, an optical neural network framework that is capable of concurrent detection of laser fault injection attacks. This paper first presents an illustrative threat of laser fault injection attacks on SPAAs, capable of subjecting the optical neural network to misclassifications. The threat then is addressed in this paper by developing techniques for concurrent detection of the laser fault injection attacks. Furthermore, this paper introduces a novel application of Wavelength Division Perturbation (WDP) technique where wavelength-dependent Vector Matrix Multiplication (VMM) results are utilized to boost fault attack detection accuracy. Simulation results show that PrometheusFree achieves over 96% attack-caused misprediction recall as the use of the WDP technique squashes the attack success rate by 38.6% on average. Compared with prior art, PrometheusFree limits the average attack success ratio to 0.019, yielding a 95.3% reduction. The experimental results confirm the superiority of the concurrent detection and the boost in attack detection abilities imparted by the WDP approaches.</description>

      <title>Experimental proposal of a mode sorter for vector vortex beams of arbitrary order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for sorting vector vortex beams using a system of three optical cavities. The method targets the separation of the four vector vortex modes of a given order m by exploiting their symmetry properties with respect to radial axes. The first cavity separates the modes into two pairs, one symmetric and one antisymmetric under horizontal flip, by transmitting one pair and reflecting the other. Each output is then directed into a second cavity, which further resolves the pairs into individual modes based on their parity. A key element between the cavities is a novel system introduced in this work, the Profile Rotator (PR), which rigidly rotates the beam profile (including its polarization structure) using an appropriately calibrated K-mirror and a Faraday rotator. The theoretical framework is based on the analysis of mode symmetries and their interaction with cavity boundary conditions. This work lays the groundwork for experimental implementations of efficient mode sorting, with potential applications in high-dimensional quantum information processing, optical communications, and structured light manipulation.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Holographic Reconstruction via Amplitude-Only Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Tunable Synthetic Wavelength Ranging with an RFSoC</title>

Abstract: Measurements of optical range and time-of-flight are crucial for a variety of high-precision technologies. Competitive optical measurement techniques have been developed that balance precision with accuracy and system complexity. Here, we present a continuous-wave synthetic wavelength interferometry technique that employs digitally tunable electro-optic frequency combs. With a software-defined radio, our approach can dynamically sweep the synthetic wavelength and measure absolute optical range. We demonstrate this digital approach over a free-space optical delay line of 1 m and over an 40 km fiber link. The best obtained precision over the delay line is better than 60 nm (0.2 fs). Through a 40 km fiber spool, this precision degrades to 15 um (50 fs), which is a fractional error on the order of 2e-10 m/m. Our design is simple to implement, and only relies on continuous-wave interference, decreasing system complexity.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanical systems have recently been proposed as detectors for ultralight dark matter, leveraging their ability to cool and probe mechanical oscillators at the quantum limit. Here we present a resonant search for ultralight dark matter using a cavity optomechanical accelerometer. The detector consists of a cryogenic Si$_3$N$_4$-membrane cavity mounted to a 4 K copper plate, with photothermal tuning used to scan its 39 kHz mechanical resonance. Shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation-pressure feedback cooling yield an acceleration sensitivity of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over 30 Hz near resonance. The detector's material inhomogeneity gives access to direct vector coupling to the dark-matter field. We conduct a Bayesian search based on matched-filter statistics, yielding upper bounds consistent with thermal noise and above those set by equivalence principle tests. No signal is observed, but the experiment demonstrates stable, quantum-limited operation and validates a scalable approach to resonant detection. With optimized test masses, lower temperature, and multiplexed arrays, the platform offers a path toward competitive constraints on vector-mediated dark-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Free expansion of a charged nanoparticle via electrostatic compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent wavepacket expansion is a key component of recent proposals aiming to create non-classical states of a levitated dielectric nanoparticle. Free evolution, i.e., releasing the particle from its harmonic trapping potential and allowing its position variance to grow, is a simple but effective expansion scheme, but requires accurate force compensation to avoid significant mean displacements of the wavepacket during the free evolution. Here, using an optical trap-release-recapture sequence, we demonstrate an electrostatic compensation technique that enables free evolution without significant mean displacement in 3D, successfully compensating both gravity and stray electric fields. To achieve 100 microsecond free evolution times with charged particles, we developed methods to map and correct for force cross-talk, as well as to control the environmental charge state. Combined with a low decoherence environment, our approach enables the preparation of largely delocalized states without the need for long freefall trajectories or a low-gravity environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>
