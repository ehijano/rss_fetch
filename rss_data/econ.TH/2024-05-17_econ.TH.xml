      <title>Organizational Selection of Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Budgetary constraints force organizations to pursue only a subset of possible innovation projects. Identifying which subset is most promising is an error-prone exercise, and involving multiple decision makers may be prudent. This raises the question of how to most effectively aggregate their collective nous. Our model of organizational portfolio selection provides some first answers. We show that portfolio performance can vary widely. Delegating evaluation makes sense when organizations employ the relevant experts and can assign projects to them. In most other settings, aggregating the impressions of multiple agents leads to better performance than delegation. In particular, letting agents rank projects often outperforms alternative aggregation rules -- including averaging agents' project scores as well as counting their approval votes -- especially when organizations have tight budgets and can select only a few project alternatives out of many.</description>

      <title>Economics of Integrated Sensing and Communication service provision in 6G networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Beyond5G and 6G networks, a common theme is that sensing will play a more significant role than ever before. Over this trend, Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is focused on unifying the sensing functionalities and the communications ones and to pursue direct tradeoffs between them as well as mutual performance gains. We frame the resource tradeoff between the SAC functionalities within an economic setting. We model a service provision by one operator to the users, the utility of which is derived from both SAC functionalities. The tradeoff between the resources that the operator assigns to the SAC functionalities is analyzed from the point of view of the service prices, quantities and profits. We demonstrate that equilibrium quantities and prices exist. And we provide relevant recommendations for enforcing regulatory limits of both power and bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Designing Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies strategic communication in the context of social learning. Product reviews are used by consumers to learn product quality, but in order to write a review, a consumer must be convinced to purchase the item first. When reviewers care about welfare of future consumers, this leads to a conflict: a reviewer today wants the future consumers to purchase the item even when this comes at a loss to them, so that more information is revealed for the consumers that come after. We show that due to this conflict, communication via reviews is inevitably noisy, regardless of whether reviewers can commit to a communication strategy or have to resort to cheap talk. The optimal communication mechanism involves truthful communication of extreme experiences and pools the moderate experiences together.</description>

      <title>On conditioning and consistency for nonlinear functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of conditional nonlinear expectations defined on the space of bounded random variables and indexed by the class of all the sub-sigma-algebras of a given underlying sigma-algebra. We show that if this family satisfies a natural consistency property, then it collapses to a conditional certainty equivalent defined in terms of a state-dependent utility function. This result is obtained by embedding our problem in a decision theoretical framework and providing a new characterization of the Sure-Thing Principle. In particular we prove that this principle characterizes those preference relations which admit consistent backward conditional projections. We build our analysis on state-dependent preferences for a general state space as in Wakker and Zank (1999) and show that their numerical representation admits a continuous version of the state-dependent utility. In this way, we also answer positively to a conjecture posed in the aforementioned paper.</description>
