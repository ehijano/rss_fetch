      <title>Daily Liquidity Jump and Diffusion, and Treatment on Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wash trading among crypto assets induces short-term price jumps, which manifest as liquidity fluctuation. We develop a model to decompose asset liquidity into two components: liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion, which quantify the size and probability of wash trading. Using the trading data from US stock markets as a benchmark, we establish that the combination of high liquidity diffusion and high liquidity jump indicates wash trading. On the other hand, the majority of large-volume trades with high liquidity jump but low liquidity diffusion (&lt;1) are actually legitimate ones. Our model provides advice to investors in making informed decisions in crypto investments, and to regulators in taking targeted actions to combat wash trading. While we use crypto assets to exemplify the utilities of our model, the model should remain effective for other asset classes with extreme liquidity.</description>

      <title>Portfolio credit risk with Archimedean copulas: asymptotic analysis and efficient simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study large losses arising from defaults of a credit portfolio. We assume that the portfolio dependence structure is modelled by the Archimedean copula family as opposed to the widely used Gaussian copula. The resulting model is new, and it has the capability of capturing extremal dependence among obligors. We first derive sharp asymptotics for the tail probability of portfolio losses and the expected shortfall. Then we demonstrate how to utilize these asymptotic results to produce two variance reduction algorithms that significantly enhance the classical Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, we show that the estimator based on the proposed two-step importance sampling method is logarithmically efficient while the estimator based on the conditional Monte Carlo method has bounded relative error as the number of obligors tends to infinity. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to highlight the efficiency of our proposed algorithms for estimating portfolio credit risk. In particular, the variance reduction achieved by the proposed conditional Monte Carlo method, relative to the crude Monte Carlo method, is in the order of millions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of Generalized Shortfall Risk Measures for Heavy-tailed Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a general risk measure called the generalized shortfall risk measure, which was first introduced in Mao and Cai (2018). It is proposed under the rank-dependent expected utility framework, or equivalently induced from the cumulative prospect theory. This risk measure can be flexibly designed to capture the decision maker's behavior toward risks and wealth when measuring risk. In this paper, we derive the first- and second-order asymptotic expansions for the generalized shortfall risk measure. Our asymptotic results can be viewed as unifying theory for, among others, distortion risk measures and utility-based shortfall risk measures. They also provide a blueprint for the estimation of these measures at extreme levels, and we illustrate this principle by constructing and studying a quantile-based estimator in a special case. The accuracy of the asymptotic expansions and of the estimator is assessed on several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>The lexical ratio: A new perspective on portfolio diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio diversification, traditionally measured through asset correlations and volatilitybased metrics, is fundamental to managing financial risk. However, existing diversification metrics often overlook non-numerical relationships between assets that can impact portfolio stability, particularly during market stresses. This paper introduces the lexical ratio (LR), a novel metric that leverages textual data to capture diversification dimensions absent in standard approaches. By treating each asset as a unique document composed of sectorspecific and financial keywords, the LR evaluates portfolio diversification by distributing these terms across assets, incorporating entropy-based insights from information theory. We thoroughly analyze LR's properties, including scale invariance, concavity, and maximality, demonstrating its theoretical robustness and ability to enhance risk-adjusted portfolio returns. Using empirical tests on S&amp;P 500 portfolios, we compare LR's performance to established metrics such as Markowitz's volatility-based measures and diversification ratios. Our tests reveal LR's superiority in optimizing portfolio returns, especially under varied market conditions. Our findings show that LR aligns with conventional metrics and captures unique diversification aspects, suggesting it is a viable tool for portfolio managers.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the Adjusted Standard-deviatile for Extreme Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we modify the Bayes risk for the expectile, the so-called variantile risk measure, to better capture extreme risks. The modified risk measure is called the adjusted standard-deviatile. First, we derive the asymptotic expansions of the adjusted standard-deviatile. Next, based on the first-order asymptotic expansion, we propose two efficient estimation methods for the adjusted standard-deviatile at intermediate and extreme levels. By using techniques from extreme value theory, the asymptotic normality is proved for both estimators. Simulations and real data applications are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>Is the annualized compounded return of Medallion over 35%?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a challenge to estimate fund performance by compounded returns. Arguably, it is incorrect to use yearly returns directly for compounding, with reported annualized return of above 60% for Medallion for the 31 years up to 2018. We propose an estimation based on fund sizes and trading profits and obtain a compounded return of 31.8% before fees. Alternatively, we suggest using the manager's wealth as a proxy and arriving at a compounded growth rate of 25.6% for Simons for the 33 years up to 2020. We conclude that the annualized compounded return of Medallion before fees is probably under 35%. Our findings have implications for correctly estimating fund performance.</description>

      <title>Risk-neutral valuation of options under arithmetic Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On April 22, 2020, the CME Group switched to Bachelier pricing for a group of oil futures options. The Bachelier model, or more generally the arithmetic Brownian motion (ABM), is not so widely used in finance, though. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of options pricing under ABM. Using the risk-neutral valuation, we derive formulas for European options for three underlying types, namely an underlying that does not pay dividends, an underlying that pays a continuous dividend yield, and futures. Further, we derive Black-Scholes-Merton-like partial differential equations, which can in principle be utilized to price American options numerically via finite difference.</description>
