      <title>Geometry helps in routing scalability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) aims to address a myriad of significant networking challenges that appear in time-varying settings, such as mobile and satellite networks, wherein changes in network topology are frequent and often subject to environmental constraints. Within this paradigm, routing problems are often solved by extending classical graph-theoretic path finding algorithms, such as the Bellman-Ford or Floyd-Warshall algorithms, to the time-varying setting; such extensions are simple to understand, but they have strict optimality criteria and can exhibit non-polynomial scaling. Acknowledging this, we study time-varying shortest path problems on metric graphs whose vertices are traced by semi-algebraic curves. As an exemplary application, we establish a polynomial upper bound on the number of topological critical events encountered by a set of $n$ satellites moving along elliptic curves in low Earth orbit (per orbital period). Experimental evaluations on networks derived from STARLINK satellite TLE's demonstrate that not only does this geometric framework allow for routing schemes between satellites requiring recomputation an order of magnitude less than graph-based methods, but it also demonstrates metric spanner properties exist in metric graphs derived from real-world data, opening the door for broader applications of geometric DTN routing.</description>

      <title>Dynamic data summarization for hierarchical spatial clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) finds meaningful patterns in spatial data by considering density and spatial proximity. As the clustering algorithm is inherently designed for static applications, so have recent studies focused on accelerating the algorithm for static applications using approximate or parallel methods. However, much less attention has been given to dynamic environments, where even a single point insertion or deletion can require recomputing the clustering hierarchy from scratch due to the need of maintaining the minimum spanning tree (MST) over a complete graph. This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing the clustering algorithm for dynamic data. We present an exact algorithm that maintains density information and updates the clustering hierarchy of HDBSCAN during point insertions and deletions. Considering the hardness of adapting the exact algorithm to dynamic data involving modern workloads, we propose an online-offline framework. The online component efficiently summarizes dynamic data using a tree structure, called Bubble-tree, while the offline step performs the static clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that the data summarization adapts well to fully dynamic environments, providing compression quality on par with existing techniques while significantly improving runtime performance of the clustering algorithm in dynamic data workloads.</description>

      <title>Randomized Communication and Implicit Graph Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the focused study of constant-cost randomized communication, with emphasis on its connection to graph representations. We observe that constant-cost randomized communication problems are equivalent to hereditary (i.e. closed under taking induced subgraphs) graph classes which admit constant-size adjacency sketches and probabilistic universal graphs (PUGs), which are randomized versions of the well-studied adjacency labeling schemes and induced-universal graphs. This gives a new perspective on long-standing questions about the existence of these objects, including new methods of constructing adjacency labeling schemes.
  We ask three main questions about constant-cost communication, or equivalently, constant-size PUGs: (1) Are there any natural, non-trivial problems aside from Equality and k-Hamming Distance which have constant-cost communication? We provide a number of new examples, including deciding whether two vertices have path-distance at most k in a planar graph, and showing that constant-size PUGs are preserved by the Cartesian product operation. (2) What structures of a problem explain the existence or non-existence of a constant-cost protocol? We show that in many cases a Greater-Than subproblem is such a structure. (3) Is the Equality problem complete for constant-cost randomized communication? We show that it is not: there are constant-cost problems which do not reduce to Equality.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Low-dimensional Synthetic Data from High-dimensional Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private synthetic data provide a powerful mechanism to enable data analysis while protecting sensitive information about individuals. However, when the data lie in a high-dimensional space, the accuracy of the synthetic data suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a differentially private algorithm to generate low-dimensional synthetic data efficiently from a high-dimensional dataset with a utility guarantee with respect to the Wasserstein distance. A key step of our algorithm is a private principal component analysis (PCA) procedure with a near-optimal accuracy bound that circumvents the curse of dimensionality. Unlike the standard perturbation analysis, our analysis of private PCA works without assuming the spectral gap for the covariance matrix.</description>
