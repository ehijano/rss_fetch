      <title>Autocorrelation Measurement of Attosecond Pulses Based on Two-Photon Double Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autocorrelation measurement is theoretically demonstrated to characterize attosecond pulses by studying the two-photon double ionization (TPDI) process. An interferometric autocorrelation curve is presented in the change of TPDI probability with the time delay between two identical attosecond pulses, and its full width at half maximum (FWHM) $\tau_{e}$ has a relationship $\tau_{e}=1.77\tau+15$ with the FWHM $\tau$ of the attosecond pulse. The curve is also decoded to obtain the center frequency and FWHM of the attosecond pulse by fitting. In addition, the required peak intensity of the attosecond pulse is estimated to be on the order of $10^{16}\,\rm{Wcm^{-2}}$ in autocorrelation experiments. The findings pave the way for autocorrelation measurement of intense isolated attosecond pulses.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary behavior of the upconversion processes of $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$ ions pair doping the $Y_2O_3$ ceramic illuminated with 976 nm laser light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The studies of the upconversion response of RE ions in various hosts usually depict a static picture, whereas, at constant illumination, the upconverted emission is also constant. We discovered here that, at least in the case of $Y_2O_3$ doped with $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$, this is not the case. At constant illuminated power, the upconversion emission is not only fluctuating, but it varies in a manner which seems to be a superposition of intensity waves with different frequencies. We present here the results of the measurements we've performed on $Y_2O_3$ with $1\%Er^{3+}-2\%Yb^{3+}$. The origin of this effect remain to be established but it shows that the energy transfers during the upconversion are an interplay of absorption-saturation-emission-relaxation processes.</description>

      <title>Simple, highly-stable transfer cavity for laser stabilization based on a carbon-fiber reinforced polymer spacer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the design and operation of a high-stability Fabry-Perot cavity, for laser stabilization in cavity quantum-electrodynamics experiments. Our design is based on an inexpensive and readily available uniaxial carbon-fiber reinforced polymer tube spacer, featuring an ultra-low thermal expansion coefficient. As a result, our $136\mathrm{mm}$-long cavity, which has a finesse of ${5160}$, shows a coefficient of thermal expansion of $1.6 \times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Enclosing it in a hermetic chamber at room-pressure and using a simple temperature stabilization, we observe absolute frequency excursions over a full day below $50~\mathrm{MHz}$ for a laser operating at $446.785\mathrm{THz}$. The frequency stability is limited by the imperfect thermal isolation from the environment and can be corrected using a built-in piezo-electric actuator. In addition, we discuss a different variant of this design and identify future improvements. Our system provides a cost-effective and robust solution for transferring laser stability over different wavelengths, as well as for linewidth reduction or spectral filtering of CW laser sources for applications in quantum science.</description>

      <title>Deployment of a Transportable Yb Optical Lattice Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first deployment of a ytterbium (Yb) transportable optical lattice clock (TOLC), commercially shipping the clock 3,000 km from Boulder, Colorado to Washington DC. The system, composed of a rigidly mounted optical reference cavity, atomic physics package, and an optical frequency comb, fully realizes an independent frequency standard for comparisons in the optical and microwave domains. The shipped Yb TOLC was fully operational within 2 days of arrival, enabling frequency comparisons with rubidium (Rb) fountains at the United States Naval Observatory (USNO). To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first deployment of a fully independent TOLC, including the frequency comb, coherently uniting the optical stability of the Yb TOLC to the microwave output of the Rb fountain.</description>

      <title>Many-body gap protection of motional dephasing of an optical clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation and metrology with atoms, ions, and molecules often rely on using light fields to manipulate their internal states. The absorbed momentum from the light fields can induce spin-orbit coupling and associated motional-induced (Doppler) dephasing, which may limit the coherence time available for metrology and simulation. We experimentally demonstrate the suppression of Doppler dephasing on a strontium optical clock transition by enabling atomic interactions through a shared mode in a high-finesse optical ring cavity. The interactions create a many-body energy gap that increases with atom number, suppressing motional dephasing when it surpasses the dephasing energy scale. This collective approach offers an alternative to traditional methods, like Lamb-Dicke confinement or M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, for advancing optical quantum sensors and simulations.</description>

      <title>About the role of short and long trajectories on the quantum optical state after high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) involves the up-conversion of a high-intensity driving field into its harmonic orders. This process is intrinsically non-classical, requiring from quantum mechanics for a complete explanation as, under suitable conditions, involves phenomena such as particle tunneling through a potential barrier. When exposed to a high-intensity, low-frequency laser field, bound electrons ionize via tunneling, accelerate under the driving field, and recombine with the parent ion, emitting high-harmonic radiation. However, electrons can follow two distinct pathways -- short and long trajectories -- during these steps. In this work, we evaluate the signatures left by these trajectories on the quantum optical state after HHG, and observe that they lead to entanglement between the driving field and the generated harmonics. By leveraging these correlations, we use harmonic generation to herald the creation of optical Schr\"odinger cat-like states in the driving field. Additionally, using an ab-initio approach, we examine how propagation effects, which spatially separate the harmonic contributions from short and long trajectories, influence the non-classical characteristics of the emitted light.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transfer of a Rydberg W-state to a multi-mode photonic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A robust quantum protocol has been developed that achieves highly efficient entanglement transfer from a three-atom Rydberg system, initially in a W state (|rrg&gt;+|rgr&gt;+|grr&gt;)/3^0.5, to an equivalent photonic W state (|101&gt;+|110&gt;+|011&gt;)/3^0.5. The entanglement transfer is achieved by dynamically adjusting the cavity mode frequencies and modulating the coupling rates, simplifying the complex transfer process into a sequence of processes involving two-level avoided crossings. We demonstrate that entanglement transfer can be achieved using either a fully adiabatic protocol or one with controlled non-adiabatic transitions at avoided crossings, generated by continuously chirping the cavity modes. Our adiabatic protocol uses the fractional STIRAP method to facilitate the partial population transfer required for generation of the photonic W state. In comparison, the non-adiabatic protocol uses non-adiabatic transitions to achieve the required partial population transfer. Furthermore, we propose two strategies for experimental implementation of our protocols.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced field-linked states of ultracold polar molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the existence of stable bound states between pairs of ultracold diatomic molecules with the aid of a static electric field and 1D harmonic confinement. We focus on collisions of NaK-NaK identical fermions, for which we find that currently achievable experimental parameters allow the observation of these confinement-induced field-linked bound states as scattering resonances. The bound state is highly stable with lifetimes estimated to be tens of seconds long. With the diatomic molecules bound at distances a fraction of the dipolar length scale, these complexes allow for explorations of polyatomic chemistry and Fermi gas superfluid pairing.</description>

      <title>A conveyor-belt magneto-optical trap of CaF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a conveyor-belt magneto-optical trap for calcium monofluoride (CaF) molecules. The obtained highly-compressed cloud has a mean radius of 64(5) $\mu$m and a peak number density of $3.6(5) \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, a 600-fold increase over the conventional red-detuned MOTs of CaF, and the densest molecular MOT observed to date. Subsequent loading of these molecules into an optical dipole trap yields up to $2.6 \times 10^4$ trapped molecules at a temperature of 14(2) $\mu$K with a peak phase-space density of $\sim 2.4 \times 10^{-6}$. This opens new possibilities for a range of applications utilizing high-density, optically trapped ultracold molecules.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent and measurement feedback control based on atoms coupled with a semi-infinite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that quantum feedback control may be applied to generate desired states for atomic and photonic systems based on a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this set-up, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, which can be reflected by the terminal mirror or other atoms to establish different feedback loops via the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are at most two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (waveguide QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be interpreted using random graph theory. While this process is influenced by the environment, and we clarify that the environment-induced dynamics can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Thus, in the open system atom-waveguide interactions, measurement-based feedback can modulate the final steady quantum state, while simultaneously, the homodyne detection noise in the measurement process can induce oscillations, which is treated by the coherent feedback designs.</description>

      <title>Individually tunable tunnelling coefficients in optical lattices using local periodic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have emerged as powerful quantum simulators of translationally invariant systems with many applications in e.g.\ strongly-correlated and topological systems. However, the ability to locally tune all Hamiltonian parameters remains an outstanding goal that would enable the simulation of a wider range of quantum phenomena. Motivated by recent advances in quantum gas microscopes and optical tweezers, we here show theoretically how local control over individual tunnelling links in an optical lattice can be achieved by incorporating local time-periodic potentials. We propose to periodically modulate the on-site energy of individual lattice sites and employ Floquet theory to demonstrate how this provides full individual control over the tunnelling amplitudes in one dimension. We provide various example configurations realising interesting topological models such as extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models that would be challenging to realise by other means. Extending to two dimensions, we demonstrate that local periodic driving in a Lieb lattice engineers a 2D network with fully controllable tunnelling magnitudes. In a three-site plaquette, we show full simultaneous control over the relative tunnelling amplitudes and the gauge-invariant flux piercing the plaquette, providing a clear stepping stone to building a fully programmable 2D tight-binding model. We also explicitly demonstrate how utilise our technique to generate a magnetic field gradient in 2D. This local modulation scheme is applicable to many different lattice geometries.</description>

      <title>Cooperative atomic emission from a line of atoms interacting with a resonant plane surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative effects such as super- and subradiance can be observed in the fluorescence emitted by a system of N atoms in vacuum, after interaction with a laser beam. In the vicinity of a dielectric or metallic surface, Casimir-Polder effects can modify collective atomic frequency shifts and decay rates. In this work, we study cooperative fluorescent emission next to resonant surfaces using the coupled dipoles model. We show that cooperative effects, expected in free space, are absent when the atoms are close to a surface whose polariton resonances coincide with the dominant atomic dipole coupling. In this case, cooperative effects are overshadowed by the very fast decay of the atomic fluorescence into surface modes. We illustrate our formalism and our results by considering a line of cesium 6D3/2 atoms in front of a sapphire surface. Finally, we propose the study of Cesium 6P3/2 atoms in front of a resonant metasurface as the most promising scenario for experimentally demonstrating the results of our study.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of first sound in a weakly interacting ultracold Fermi liquid: an exact calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At low temperature, a normal gas of unpaired spin-1/2 fermions is one of the cleanest realizations of a Fermi liquid. It is described by Landau's theory, where no phenomenological parameters are needed as the quasiparticle interaction function can be computed perturbatively in powers of the scattering length $a$, the sole parameter of the short-range interparticle interactions. Obtaining an accurate solution of the transport equation nevertheless requires a careful treatment of the collision kernel, as the uncontrolled error made by the relaxation time approximations increases when the temperature $T$ drops below the Fermi temperature. Here, we study sound waves in the hydrodynamic regime up to second order in the Chapman-Enskog's expansion. We find that the frequency $\omega_q$ of the sound wave is shifted above its linear depart as $\omega_q=c_1 q(1+\alpha q^2\tau^2)$ where $c_1$ and $q$ are the speed and wavenumber of the wave and the typical collision time $\tau$ scales as $1/a^2T^2$. Besides the shear viscosity, the coefficient $\alpha$ is described by a single second-order collision time which we compute exactly from an analytical solution of the transport equation, resulting in a positive dispersion $\alpha&gt;0$. Our results suggest that ultracold atomic Fermi gases are an ideal experimental system for quantitative tests of second order hydrodynamics.</description>
