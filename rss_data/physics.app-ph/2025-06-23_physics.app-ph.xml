      <title>Parallel nonlinear neuromorphic computing with temporal encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of deep learning applications has intensified the demand for electronic hardware with low energy consumption and fast computing speed. Neuromorphic photonics have emerged as a viable alternative to directly process high-throughput information at the physical space. However, the simultaneous attainment of high linear and nonlinear expressivity posse a considerable challenge due to the power efficiency and impaired manipulability in conventional nonlinear materials and optoelectronic conversion. Here we introduce a parallel nonlinear neuromorphic processor that enables arbitrary superposition of information states in multi-dimensional channels, only by leveraging the temporal encoding of spatiotemporal metasurfaces to map the input data and trainable weights. The proposed temporal encoding nonlinearity is theoretically proved to flexibly customize the nonlinearity, while preserving quasi-static linear transformation capability within each time partition. We experimentally demonstrated the concept based on distributed spatiotemporal metasurfaces, showcasing robust performance in multi-label recognition and multi-task parallelism with asynchronous modulation. Remarkably, our nonlinear processor demonstrates dynamic memory capability in autonomous planning tasks and real-time responsiveness to canonical maze-solving problem. Our work opens up a flexible avenue for a variety of temporally-modulated neuromorphic processors tailored for complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improving the lifetime of aluminum-based superconducting qubits through atomic layer etching and deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dry surface treatment combining atomic layer etching and deposition (ALE and ALD) to mitigate dielectric loss in fully fabricated superconducting quantum devices formed from aluminum thin films on silicon. The treatment, performed as a final processing step prior to device packaging, starts by conformally removing the native metal oxide and fabrication residues from the exposed surfaces through ALE before \textit{in situ} encapsulating the metal surfaces with a thin dielectric layer using ALD. We measure a two-fold reduction in loss attributed to two-level system (TLS) absorption in treated aluminum-based resonators and planar transmon qubits. Treated transmons with compact capacitor plates and gaps achieve median $Q$ and $T_1$ values of $3.69 \pm 0.42 \times 10^6$ and $196 \pm 22$~$\mu$s, respectively. These improvements were found to be sustained over several months. We discuss how the combination of ALE and ALD reverses fabrication-induced surface damages to significantly and durably improve device performance via a reduction of the TLS defect density in the capacitive elements.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal-flexural wave mode conversion via periodically undulated waveguides with constant and graded profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave mode conversion allows to transform energy from one propagating wave type to another at a boundary where a change in material properties or geometry occurs. Converting longitudinal waves to flexural ones is of particular interest in elasticity due to their significant displacement amplitudes, facilitating detection at the surface for practical applications. Typically, the design of wave conversion devices requires (i) the use of locally resonant structures with a spacing much shorter than the associated wavelengths, or (ii) architected media whose effective properties yield efficient mode conversion at selected frequencies. In both cases, the realization of these devices may incur in fabrication difficulties, thus requiring alternative solutions based on simpler designs that can retain the wave manipulation capabilities of interest. In this paper, we propose the use of single-phase periodically undulated beams to design phononic crystals that achieve wave mode conversion between longitudinal and flexural waves. We derive the corresponding dispersion relations using the plane wave expansion method and demonstrate that the coupling between longitudinal and flexural wave modes can be manipulated using an undulated profile, generating mode veering with inverted group velocities. The wave conversion mechanism is verified both computationally and experimentally, showing good agreement. Our findings indicate a versatile design strategy for phononic crystals with efficient wave conversion property, enabling applications in structural health monitoring, sensing, and non-destructive testing.</description>

      <title>Eigenmode-Guided Amplification via Spatiotemporal Active Acoustic Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatiotemporal gain-loss framework for selective acoustic mode amplification illustrated using coupled Helmholtz resonators. In our scheme, the gain or loss in each resonator is determined by the amplitude in adjacent cavities, forming a non-Hermitian yet energy-conserving system. Our scheme enables the system to collapse toward the eigenstate of an effective linear Hamiltonian with the eigenvalue of largest imaginary part, serving as a fixed-point attractor. In dimer systems, we identify exceptional points that separate oscillatory and convergent regimes, allowing controllable switching between mode collapsing and Rabi-type oscillation. By modulating the gain-loss profile over time, we achieve programmable transitions between eigenmodes, with strategically introduced symmetry-breaking perturbations accelerating convergence. Full-wave simulations validate our approach and highlight its potential for acoustic switching, signal processing, and analog computation. Our results establish a new paradigm for sustainable wave control by bridging non-Hermitian physics and time-varying physics in resonant metamaterials.</description>

      <title>On the Practicability of Ceramic-Tiled Walls for Sound Absorption by Tuning Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the practicality of structuring ceramic tiles for enhancing sound absorption on rigid walls. The cornerstone of our methodology is to structure walls with cavities so that walls effectively behave as heterogeneous absorbing surfaces over a large frequency bandwidth. Using this approach, ceramic tiled walls are developed by integrating tuned cavity structures based on Helmholtz resonators. Such a design leverages the empty joints between tiles to form resonator necks, while the space between the ceramic tiles and the wall acts as the resonator chambers. By arranging these resonators in a spatially graded array, we achieve broadband sound absorption which targets low-frequency noise generated by impacts, footsteps and ambient sources. This makes the system highly suitable for practical architectural applications. The study encompasses the entire process, from numerical modeling and analytical formulation to the fabrication and mounting of resonant tiles, followed by experimental validation, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solution in real-world conditions. The findings highlight the strong potential of this approach for practical tiled room acoustic treatment and noise mitigation.</description>

      <title>LPCVD based Plasma Damage Free in situ etching of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ using Solid Source Gallium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a novel in situ etching technique for $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ using solid-source metallic Ga in a LPCVD system, enabling clean, anisotropic, plasma damage-free etching. Etching behavior was systematically studied on (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films and patterned (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates as a function of temperature, Ar carrier gas flow, and Ga source-to-substrate distance. The process exhibits vapor transport- and surface-reaction-limited behavior, with etch rates reaching a maximum of $\sim$2.25~$\mu$m/hr on (010) substrates at 1050~$^\circ$C and 2 cm spacing. Etch rates decrease sharply with increasing source-to-substrate distance due to reduced Ga vapor availability, while elevated temperatures enhance surface reaction kinetics through increased Ga reactivity and suboxide formation, leading to enhanced etch rates. In-plane anisotropy studies using radial trench patterns reveal that the (100) orientation produces the most stable etch front, characterized by smooth, vertical sidewalls and minimal lateral etching, consistent with its lowest surface free energy. In contrast, orientations such as (101), which possess higher surface energy, exhibit pronounced lateral etching and micro-faceting. As the trench orientation progressively deviates from (100), lateral etching increases. Facet evolution is observed between (100) and (-102), where stepped sidewalls composed of alternating (100) and (-102) segments progressively transition into a single inclined facet, which stabilizes along (100) or (-102) depending on the trench orientation. The (100)-aligned fins exhibit minimal bottom curvature, while (201)-aligned structures display increased under-etching and trench rounding.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-empowered freely-arrangeable multi-task diffractive neural networks with weighted training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in optical computing have garnered considerable research interests owing to its ener-gy-efficient operation and ultralow latency characteristics. As an emerging framework in this domain, dif-fractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) integrate deep learning algorithms with optical diffraction principles to perform computational tasks at light speed without requiring additional energy consumption. Neverthe-less, conventional D2NN architectures face functional limitations and are typically constrained to single-task operations or necessitating additional costs and structures for functional reconfiguration. Here, an arrangea-ble diffractive neural network (A-DNN) that achieves low-cost reconfiguration and high operational versa-tility by means of diffractive layer rearrangement is presented. Our architecture enables dynamic reordering of pre-trained diffractive layers to accommodate diverse computational tasks. Additionally, we implement a weighted multi-task loss function that allows precise adjustment of task-specific performances. The efficacy of the system is demonstrated by both numerical simulations and experimental validations of recognizing handwritten digits and fashions at terahertz frequencies. Our proposed architecture can greatly expand the flexibility of D2NNs at a low cost, providing a new approach for realizing high-speed, energy-efficient ver-satile artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Terahertz channel performance under dynamic water surface reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the terahertz (THz) band emerges as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless communications, accurate channel modeling in dynamic environments becomes increasingly critical, particularly for scenarios involving reflective interactions with water surfaces. This article presents comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations into THz channel (120-320 GHz) performance under dynamic water surface reflections. By developing and validating a modified dual-scale scattering model based on the improved integral equation model (I2EM), this work systematically evaluates channel characteristics, such as signal power loss and bit error rate (BER), across various dynamic aquatic scenarios. Laboratory experiments and real-world natatorium measurements demonstrate the model's efficacy in capturing complex temporal and spatial scattering behaviors, offering vital insights and robust predictive capabilities essential for deploying possible THz communication systems in aquatic and sports environments.</description>

      <title>Numerically studying Pesticide diffusion in air using Langevin formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of pesticides for enhancing crop yield and preventing infestations is a widespread agricultural practice. However, in recent years, there has been a growing shift toward traditional chemical-free organic farming. Regulatory frameworks impose specific distance requirements between organic farms and neighboring lands where chemical pesticides are used to minimize cross-contamination. In this work, we numerically analyze the spread of pesticide droplets to adjacent fields under varying weather conditions, providing a systematic analysis that highlights conditions where existing guidelines might require reassessment. We employ the formalism of the Langevin equations to model the diffusion of pesticide particles and their transport due to wind and other environmental factors. Assuming a non-relativistic, classical diffusion framework, we track the dispersion of commonly used pesticides to assess their potential contamination range. We present our key findings, discuss their implications, and, toward the end, outline possible directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Metamaterial Bi-stable Vibration Absorbers for Railway Tracks: Experimental Study of Flexural Wave Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subway rail vibrations result in serious problems in urban railway systems as they cause structural damage, as well as increase noise pollution and discomfort of passengers. This paper aims to present an experimental study on the application of Dynamic Vibration Absorbers (DVAs) to reduce unwanted rail vibrations. The effectiveness of various DVA configurations was evaluated using Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) and stochastic vibration analysis on a UIC60/60E1 rail. The results of the study show that well-designed DVAs can decrease vibration by up to 74%, while periodic installations with a 1 m span create a grid-like structure that exhibits metamaterial behavior, enhancing suppression up to 98%. This periodic arrangement leads to attenuation in critical frequency bands due to flexural wave interference effects. Further, Random vibration analysis is also performed to assess the real performance of DVAs under stochastic excitations, and the results show that the RMS reduction is, on an average, 12%. The results of the study show that DVAs are portable, non-invasive, and very efficient systems for the management of railway vibration, as well as the reduction of the effects on the environment and enhancing the strength of the infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low damping of the translational motion of a composite graphite particle in a magneto-gravitational trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an ultra-low dissipation, one-dimensional mechanical oscillator formed by levitating a millimeter-scale composite graphite particle in a room-temperature magneto-gravitational trap. The trap's magnetic field geometry, based on a linear quadrupole, eliminates first-order field gradients in the axial direction, yielding a low oscillation frequency with negligibly low eddy-current losses. Direct ring-down measurements under vacuum compare the damping of the vertical and axial motion; while the vertical motion damps in seconds, the axial motion shows no apparent damping in 24 hours. Analysis reveals that this dramatic difference in damping is a result of the symmetry of the magnetic field and the anisotropy of the trap strength. The results are remarkably robust, demonstrating a potential platform for inertial and gravitational sensing.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Failure, Repair and Mobility Rates for Markov Reliability Systems: A Wind-Farm application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rate of Occurrence of Failures (ROCOF) is a widely utilized indicator for assessing a system's performance over time, yet it does not fully disclose the instantaneous behavior of a system. This paper introduces new measures to complement the ROCOF, providing a more comprehensive understanding of system reliability, particularly for Markov systems. We define the Rate of Occurrence of Repairs (ROCOR), which quantifies the system's instantaneous tendency to transition from failure to working states, and the Rate of Inoccurrence (ROI), which measures the propensity to remain within the current subset of states (either working or failure) without transitioning out. Explicit expressions for the computation of these rates are derived for Markov systems. Furthermore, a Total Mobility Rate (TMR) is proposed, integrating these individual rates to capture the overall dynamism of the system. The utility of these new indicators is demonstrated through a significant real-world application to wind farm management. The results from the wind farm study show that ROCOR, ROI, and TMR, when used in conjunction with ROCOF, reveal nuanced operational dynamics and reliability characteristics that are not discernible from static measures like Weibull parameters or ROCOF alone. These indicators can distinguish between sites with similar long-term wind profiles by identifying different "reliability logics," such as persistence-driven versus transition-driven behaviors. This enriched, time-dependent perspective provides valuable information for maintenance scheduling, operational strategies, and risk assessment, ultimately enhancing the ability to manage complex systems effectively.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties of a Spherical Magnetic Field Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherical harmonic expansions are well-established tools for estimating magnetic fields from surface measurements and are widely used in applications such as tomographic imaging, geomagnetism, and biomagnetism. Although the mathematical foundations of these expansions are well understood, the impact of real-world imperfections, on the uncertainty of the field model has received little attention. In this work, we present a systematic uncertainty propagation analysis for a magnetic field camera that estimates the field from surface measurements using a spherical array of Hall magnetometers arranged in a spherical t-design. A Monte Carlo-based approach is employed to quantify how sensor-related uncertainties, such as calibration errors and positioning inaccuracies, affect the spatial distribution of the estimated field's uncertainty. The results offer insights into the robustness of spherical harmonic methods and help identify the dominant sources of uncertainty in practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Electron beam irradiation-induced transport and recombination in p-type Gallium Oxide grown on (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates minority electron diffusion length and carrier recombination phenomena within p-type, 300 nm-thick Ga2O3 epitaxial films. Utilizing Electron Beam-Induced Current (EBIC) and Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy, these characteristics were examined as a function of both temperature and the duration of electron beam excitation. While the electron diffusion length in these p-Ga2O3 films diminish with increasing temperature, a continuous electron beam excitation of a particular location on the surface of a p-Ga2O3 epitaxial layer leads to an elongation of the diffusion length. and decay of cathodoluminescence intensity in that location under beam exposure. These latter two effects are attributed to non-equilibrium electrons, generated by an electron beam, being captured at acceptor-related point defect levels in Gallium Oxide. The activation energies characterizing these processes were obtained from the independent EBIC and CL experiments to garner insight into defect landscape and its influence on transport and recombination dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Morphologically Self-Consistent Phase Field Model for the Computational Study of Memristive Thin Film Current-Voltage Hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiphysics phase field model is used for the computational study of memristive thin film morphology and current-voltage hysteresis. In contrast to previous computational methods, no requirements are made on conducting filament geometry. Our method correctly predicts conducting filaments evolve on thermodynamic paths that are energetically favored due to stochastic structural and chemical variations naturally occurring at the atomic-level, due to both latent and intentional fabrication effects. These results have significant implications for the computational design of a broad class of memristive thin films, enabling practical wafer-scale mapping, uniformity, and endurance analysis and optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Photoluminescence Theory in Nanocrystalline Silicon: A New Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon has long been the foundational semiconductor material for a broad range of electronic devices, owing to its numerous advantages: wide natural availability, ease of synthesis in both crystalline and amorphous forms, and relatively low production cost. However, despite these benefits, silicon is inherently limited in the field of optoelectronics due to its indirect bandgap, which results in low quantum efficiency for light emission, typically in the infrared region. One promising strategy to address this limitation is the development of nanocrystalline silicon, which consists of low-dimensional nanostructures such as quantum wires (QWs) and quantum dots (QDs). These structures exhibit enhanced photoluminescence and electroluminescence, primarily due to quantum confinement of excitons within the conduction and valence bands, leading to significantly improved quantum efficiency. Although research into these processes has spanned several decades, a definitive consensus on the mechanisms underlying photoluminescent emission in nanocrystalline silicon remains elusive. This work reviews two leading theoretical models proposed to explain this phenomenon and introduces a new, more comprehensive model that may provide a deeper and more accurate understanding of photoluminescence in nanocrystalline silicon. The new theory is applied in a case study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short gas pulses introduced in a vacuum chamber have long been utilized to showcase the ultra-low mass resolutions achievable with nanomechanical resonators. The resonance frequency shifts are used as evidence of gas adsorption. However, there is very little clarity as to what exactly is adsorbing on to the resonators. We demonstrate that the physisorption of gases on cantilevers is predominantly the effect of moisture content that is present even in ultra-high purity gases. The experimental work is performed at low temperatures and in a high vacuum and is supported by theoretical calculations and simulation.</description>

      <title>Optically tunable linear and nonlinear enhancement of index of refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control of optical properties of materials by tuning their refractive index can revolutionize the current state-of-the-art technology to manipulate light propagation in the high loss media. Here we demonstrate active optical tuning of the plasmonic analog of enhancement of index of refraction (EIR) in both linear and nonlinear regimes using a quantum mechanical approach. By employing a pump-probe scheme, we investigate the tuning of refractive index of the probe field by varying amplitude and phase of the pump source. We analyze the modulation in the response function of probe in both first- and second-order quantization, under the coupling of linear plasmonic modes supported by two L-shaped nano-ellipsoids. This approach enables indirect tuning of nonlinear modes and coherent control of the probe pulse. Varying the pump amplitude not only shows a significant enhancement in the EIR in both regimes but also effectively suppresses optical losses with zero dispersion at the system's resonance frequency. Additionally, tuning pump phase induces a spectral shift in the frequency of the probe field which open new ways for active tuning of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Our approach offers all-optical tuning of refractive index and coherent control of optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures with applications in loss-compensated propagation and zero-index to high-refractive-index plasmonic metamaterials, as well as photonic switches.</description>

Abstract: Exchanging energy below the superconducting gap introduces quasiparticle energy distributions in superconducting quantum circuits, which will be responsible for their decoherence. This study examines the impact of quasiparticle energy on the performance of NbN superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon chips. We measured the resonance frequency and internal quality factor in response to temperature sweeps to evaluate the effect of quasiparticle dynamics. Moreover, by calculating the complex conductivity of the NbN film, we identified the contribution of quasiparticle density to the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Full-spectrum modeling of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems in scattering media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile gamma-ray spectrometry (MGRS) systems are essential for localizing, identifying, and quantifying gamma-ray sources in complex environments. Full-spectrum template matching offers the highest accuracy and sensitivity for these tasks but is limited by the computational cost of generating the required spectral templates. Here, we present a generalized full-spectrum modeling framework for MGRS systems in scattering media, enabling near real-time template generation through dynamic, anisotropic instrument response functions (IRFs). Benchmarked against high-fidelity brute-force Monte Carlo simulations, our method yields a computational speedup by a factor $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$, while achieving comparable accuracy with median spectral deviations below 6%. The presented methodology is platform-agnostic and applicable across marine, terrestrial, and airborne domains, unlocking new capabilities for MGRS in a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, geophysical exploration, nuclear safeguards, and radiological emergency response.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation in Robotic Mechanical Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal patterns emerging from an initial quiescent, uniform state is a phenomenon observed in many dynamical systems sustained far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the practical application of which has only recently begun to be explored. As the underlying dynamics are typically complex, pattern formation is often theoretically analyzed and understood via phenomenological models, which effectively represent the causal mechanisms, but obscure the link between the small-scale interactions/processes and the observed macroscopic behavior. Moreover, efforts to prescribe the patterning response are often undercut by the experimental inaccessibility of the small-scale constituents/processes. This article demonstrates an artificial system (i.e., a robotic mechanical metamaterial) as an accessible and versatile platform within which to explore and prescribe the patterning response of non-equilibrium systems. Specifically, in varying a feedback parameter within the prescribed reaction kinetics, the robotic mechanical metamaterial alternately develops spatial and temporal oscillations in the displacement field following a perturbation of the initial quiescent, uniform state. The platform is amenable to a first-principles analytical description so that corresponding theoretical results possess qualitative and quantitative significance, and maintain connection to the specific system parameters.</description>

      <title>Exceptional point in a PT symmetric non-Hermitian terahertz plasmonic metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a non-Hermitian open PT-symmetric terahertz metasurface comprising complementary plasmonic structures capable of exhibiting an exceptional point (EP). The metasurface consists of two resonators of different sizes, representing effective gain and loss elements, placed orthogonally in close proximity to realize a non-Hermitian configuration leading to a PT symmetry state. A diagonal displacement of one resonator within this strongly coupled near-field configuration leads to the emergence of an exceptional point, where the system undergoes a sudden phase transition from a PT symmetric to a PT-asymmetric state. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is performed on the fabricated samples to experimentally validate the phase transition observed in numerical simulations. We employ coupled mode theory (CMT) to analyse and distinguish between the PT-symmetric, exceptional point, and PT-asymmetric states. This theoretical framework enables the calculation of eigenvalues, phase spectra, and eigenmodes associated with the metamaterial design, thereby corroborating the simulation results. Furthermore, we construct Poincare sphere to visualize the orientation of the polarization states of the eigenmodes, which further indicates the presence of the exceptional point. This comprehensive study of exceptional point in a plasmonic system holds potential for the development of practical, highly sensitive terahertz devices, addressing limitations of conventional PT-symmetric systems that rely on traditional gain and loss media.</description>

      <title>Analyzing partially-polarized light with a photonic deep random neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical neural networks are emerging as a powerful and versatile tool for processing optical signals directly in the optical domain with superior speed, integrability, and functionality. Their application to optical polarization enables neuromorphic polarization sensors, but their operation is limited to fully-polarized light. Here, we demonstrate single-shot analysis of partially-polarized beams with a photonic random neural network (PRNN). The PRNN is composed of a series of optical layers implemented by a stack of scattering media and a few trainable digital nodes. The setup infers the degree-of-polarization and the Stokes parameters of the polarized component with precision comparable to off-the-shelf polarimeters. The use of several optical layers allows to enhance the accuracy, reduce the sensor size, and minimize digital costs, demonstrating the advantage of a deep optical encoder for processing polarization information. Our results point out photonic neural networks as fast, compact, broadband, low-cost polarimeters that are widely applicable from sensing to imaging.</description>

Abstract: Low-loss waveguides enable efficient light delivery in photonic circuits, which are essential for high-speed optical communications and scalable implementations of photonic quantum technologies. We study the effects of several fabrication and experimental parameters on the waveguide losses of a silicon nitride integrated photonics platform using various machine learning techniques. Compared to more complex machine learning algorithms, our results show that a simple linear regression model with variable selection offers a lower prediction error with high interpretability. The high interpretability, along with our domain knowledge, led to unique identification of fabrication process dependencies on the final outcome. With these insights, we show that by improving the process flow, it is possible to improve the loss by mitigating the cause in a real experiment.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Optical Magnetometer: Next-Generation Approach to Sub-Nanotesla Magnetic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Solid-State Optical Magnetometer (SOM) based on black phosphorus (BP) multilayers, offering a compact, scalable, and highly sensitive alternative to traditional atomic-based magnetometers. Utilizing BP's intrinsic linear dichroism in a metasurface cavity, the SOM achieves sub-nanotesla precision and vector magnetic field sensing. BP enhances light-matter interactions, enabling tunable optical responses driven by Lorentz force-induced cavity deformation. Optimized metasurface unit cells increase polarization-dependent absorption, improving detection sensitivity. Finite Element Method simulations show high linearity (R-squared &gt; 0.999), tunable dynamic range, and adjustable sensitivity via current modulation. At 200 microamps, the SOM reaches a sensitivity of 31.25 picotesla, while lower currents expand the dynamic range up to +-10 nanotesla. This tunability allows for application-specific optimization in areas such as biomagnetic sensing, metrology, and industrial field detection. Unlike SQUIDs and optically pumped magnetometers, the BP-based SOM operates at room temperature and nanoscale dimensions with comparable sensitivity, eliminating the need for cryogenics or vapor cells. Power consumption remains under 1 microwatt, far below conventional technologies. This work establishes BP metasurface integration as a promising platform for low-power, miniaturized, and high-performance magnetic field sensing.</description>

      <title>Pattern-Based Phase-Separation of Tracer and Dispersed Phase Particles in Two-Phase Defocusing Particle Tracking Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the feasibility of a post-processing-based approach for phase separation in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry for dispersed two-phase flows. The method enables the simultaneous 3D localization determination of both tracer particles and particles of the dispersed phase, using a single-camera setup. The distinction between phases is based on pattern differences in defocused particle images, which arise from distinct light scattering behaviors of tracer particles and bubbles or droplets. Convolutional neural networks, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 variants, are trained to detect and classify particle images based on these pattern features. To generate large, labeled training datasets, a generative adversarial network based framework is introduced, allowing the generation of auto-labeled data that more closely reflects experiment-specific visual appearance. Evaluation across six datasets, comprising synthetic two-phase and real single- and two-phase flows, demonstrates high detection precision and classification accuracy (95-100%), even under domain shifts. The results confirm the viability of using CNNs for robust phase separation in disperse two-phase DPTV, particularly in scenarios where traditional wavelength-, size-, or ensemble correlation-based methods are impractical.</description>

      <title>A phase field model for hydraulic fracture: Drucker-Prager driving force and a hybrid coupling strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant interest in using phase field approaches to model hydraulic fracture, so as to optimise a process that is key to industries such as petroleum engineering, mining and geothermal energy extraction. Here, we present a novel theoretical and computational phase field framework to simulate hydraulic fracture. The framework is general and versatile, in that it allows for improved treatments of the coupling between fluid flow and the phase field, and encompasses a universal description of the fracture driving force. Among others, this allows us to bring two innovations to the phase field hydraulic fracture community: (i) a new hybrid coupling approach to handle the fracture-fluid flow interplay, offering enhanced accuracy and flexibility; and (ii) a Drucker-Prager-based strain energy decomposition, extending the simulation of hydraulic fracture to materials exhibiting asymmetric tension-compression fracture behaviour (such as shale rocks) and enabling the prediction of geomechanical phenomena such as fault reactivation and stick-slip behaviour. Four case studies are addressed to illustrate these additional modelling capabilities and bring insight into permeability coupling, cracking behaviour, and multiaxial conditions in hydraulic fracturing simulations.

      <title>Corner Topology Makes Woven Baskets into Stiff, yet Resilient Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Basket weaving is a traditional craft used to create practical three-dimensional (3D) structures. While the geometry and aesthetics of baskets have received considerable attention, the underlying mechanics and modern engineering potential remain underexplored. This work shows that 3D woven structures offer similar stiffness yet substantially higher resilience than their non-woven continuous counterparts. We explore corner topologies that serve as building blocks to convert 2D woven sheets into 3D metamaterials that can carry compressive loads. Under small deformations, the woven corners exhibit axial stiffness similar to continuous structures because the woven ribbons are engaged with in-plane loads. Under large deformations, the woven corners can be compressed repeatedly without plastic damage because ribbons can undergo elastic local buckling. We present a modular platform to assemble woven corners into complex spatial metamaterials and demonstrate applications including damage-resilient robotic systems and metasurfaces with tailorable deformation modes. Our results explain the historic appeal of basket weaving, where readily available ribbons are crafted into 3D structures with comparable stiffness yet far superior resilience to continuous systems. The modular assembly of woven metamaterials can further revolutionize design of next-generation automotive components, consumer devices, soft robots, and more where both resilience and stiffness are essential.</description>

Abstract: Compositionally engineered metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and used to fabricate ultrafast scintillating films with emission in both the UV and visible regions. The inclusion of hafnium (Hf) ions in the nodes of the MOF increases the interaction cross-section with ionizing radiation, partially compensating for the low density of the porous material and dramatically increasing the system scintillation yield. The high diffusivity of bimolecular excitons within the framed conjugated ligands allows bimolecular annihilation processes between excited states that partially quench the MOF luminescence, resulting in ultrafast scintillation pulses under X-ray excitation with kinetics in the hundreds of picoseconds time scale. Despite the quenching, the gain in scintillation yield achieved by incorporating Hf ions is large enough to maintain the light yield of the films above 104 ph/MeV under soft X-rays. These unprecedented high efficiencies and simultaneous ultrafast emission kinetics obtained at room temperature in a technologically attractive solid-state configuration, together with the versatility of its composition allowing for further application-specific modifications, place the MOF platform in a prominent position for the realization of the next generation of ultrafast scintillation counters for high-energy physics studies and medical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Intercalation-Altermagnet-Driven Ferrimagnetic-Ferroelastic Multiferroics and Anomalous and Spin Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin splitting in emerging altermagnets is non-relativistic and momentum-dependent, yet energy-independent and localized, posing challenges for practical applications. Here, we propose a paradigm of intercalation-driven altermagnets to attain ameliorative electronic structures, multiferroic characteristics, and anomalous and spin transport functionalities. As a representative system, we investigate electrochemistry- and self-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers, building on the recently reported room-temperature K- and Rb-intercalated V2Se2O family, utilizing density functional theory, Wannier function analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and non-equilibrium Green function methods. Intercalation induces room-temperature intralayer ferrimagnetic and interlayer ferromagnetic couplings (358 K for Li-intercalation and 773 K for V-intercalation), ferroelasticity (~1 % signal intensity), in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and metallization, while modifying the anomalous Hall effect. Notably, Li- and V-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers exhibit enhanced spin splitting and half-metallic behavior, respectively, yielding near-perfect spin filtering efficiencies. Intercalation substantially boosts spin transport in V2Se2O-based devices, enabling giant magnetoresistance (877 %), ultra-high thermal tunneling magnetoresistance (~12000 %), and observable spin Seebeck and temperature negative differential resistance effects. Such intercalation-altermagnet-driven paradigm pioneers the expansion of altermagnetic functionalities through multifunctional integration, offering promising avenues for advanced, miniaturized, room-temperature utilization of anomalous, electron, and spin transport.</description>

      <title>A new beamline for Resonant Excitation of Beams with Electromagnetic fields and Lasers (REBEL) and Stopping and Trapping of Radioactive Isotopes for Precision Experiments (STRIPE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two newly constructed experimental setups - REBEL (Resonant Excitation of Beams with Electromagnetic fields and Lasers) and STRIPE (Stopping and Trapping of Radioactive Isotopes for Precision Experiments) - integrated into a single offline beamline at KU Leuven. REBEL is designed for collinear laser spectroscopy of ion bunches following isobaric separation with a multireflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer, enabling high-sensitivity measurements of mass-selected fast-ion beams. In contrast, STRIPE focuses on the deceleration, trapping, and laser cooling of ions in a segmented linear Paul trap, optimized for long interrogation times and precision spectroscopy. The shared infrastructure features stable high-voltage operation ($&lt;10$ ppm), modular vacuum sections, and a fast-beam switchyard to route ions to either experiment. Initial results include a mass-resolving power of $R \approx 12900$ in REBEL and successful ion trapping and laser cooling of ions with a kinetic energy of 10 keV in STRIPE, with improved performance achieved using a frequency-modulated cooling laser. This dual-system platform enables the development and benchmarking of advanced spectroscopy and trapping techniques and is compatible with future operation at radioactive ion beam facilities.</description>

      <title>Virtual failure assessment diagrams for hydrogen transmission pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine state-of-the-art thermo-metallurgical welding process modelling with coupled diffusion-elastic-plastic phase field fracture simulations to predict the failure states of hydrogen transport pipelines. This enables quantitatively resolving residual stress states and the role of brittle, hard regions of the weld such as the heat affected zone (HAZ). Failure pressures can be efficiently quantified as a function of asset state (existing defects), materials and weld procedures adopted, and hydrogen purity. Importantly, simulations spanning numerous relevant conditions (defect size and orientations) are used to build \emph{Virtual} Failure Assessment Diagrams (FADs), enabling a straightforward uptake of this mechanistic approach in fitness-for-service assessment. Model predictions are in very good agreement with FAD approaches from the standards but show that the latter are not conservative when resolving the heterogeneous nature of the weld microstructure. Appropriate, \emph{mechanistic} FAD safety factors are established that account for the role of residual stresses and hard, brittle weld regions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Single-Pulse and Sawyer-Tower Method for Accurate Transistor Loss Separation in High-Frequency High-Efficiency Power Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of transistor parasitic capacitance and its associated energy losses is critical for evaluating device performance, particularly in high-frequency and high-efficiency power conversion systems. This paper proposes a hybrid single-pulse and Sawyer-Tower test method to analyse switching characteristics of field-effect transistors (FET), which not only eliminates overlap losses but also mitigates the effects of current backflow observed in traditional double-pulse testing. Through a precise loss separation model, it enables an accurate quantification of switching losses and provides a refined understanding of device energy dissipation mechanisms. We validate the hysteresis data and loss separation results through experimental measurements on a 350-W LLC converter, which further offers deeper insights into transistor dynamic behaviour and its dependence on operating conditions. This method is applicable to a wide range of transistors, including emerging SiC and GaN devices, and serves as a valuable tool for device characterization and optimization in power electronics.</description>

      <title>To Flow or Not To Flow? The granular Bond number to predict clogging in low gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In granular hopper flow, is the clogging probability influenced by gravity? Clogging, the spontaneous arrest of granular flow through a constriction, is a fundamental and widespread phenomenon in granular processing. Accurately predicting clogging risk is essential for space-related activities. Yet, conflicting results leave us without a reliable way to extrapolate terrestrial data to low gravity. We introduce an in-bulk definition of the dimensionless granular Bond number, B, to scale clogging probability from Earth gravity to low gravity. By testing multiple lunar regolith simulants in Earth and Moon gravitational accelerations, using an active drop tower, we reveal that low gravity significantly increases clogging risk, challenging previous findings. We observe a gravity-induced shift in the critical orifice below which clogging occurs by up to one order of magnitude. Scaling data with the Bond number unifies scattered results into a state diagram predicting clogging across materials and gravitational accelerations. Our findings provide a practical tool for anticipating granular clogging in reduced gravity, informing future space missions.</description>

      <title>Two-step focusing anamorphic catadioptric telescope and componentwise aberration compensations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aberration compensation with emphasis on the generalized spherical aberration components is discussed for plane-symmetric and anamorphic optical systems. A narrow field-of-view double-plane symmetric telescope objective containing reflective and refractive subsystems, which focus light separately in the two dimensions of the image plane, is introduced. Analytical derivation of the compensation rules is discussed for the telescope being composed of a Cassegrain-type cylindrical reflective subsystem and an economical refractive one that is determined by up to six essential parameters. Performance of a more advanced version of this telescope, which contains a less aberrative nine-parameter refractive subsystem, is studied using the ray-tracing simulator CODE~V. The telescopes of the introduced type provide two independent focal distances for the discussed focusings in the orthogonal dimensions allowing to set up a favorable field of view, and potentially can be used to achieve larger effective aperture area and resolution on a small spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Shaping non-reciprocal caustic spin-wave beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant growth of quantum technologies, and specifically quantum sensing, both in terms of the capabilities of advanced platforms and their applications. One of the leading platforms in this context is nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, providing versatile, high-sensitivity, and high-spatial-resolution magnetic sensing. Nevertheless, current schemes for spin resonance magnetic sensing (as applied by NV quantum sensing) suffer from tradeoffs associated with sensitivity, dynamic range, and bandwidth. Here we address this issue, and implement machine learning tools to enhance NV magnetic sensing in terms of the sensitivity/bandwidth tradeoff in large dynamic range scenarios. Our results indicate a potential reduction of required data points by at least a factor of 3, while maintaining the current error level. Our results promote quantum machine learning protocols for sensing applications towards more feasible and efficient quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 10$^{-7}$ W/cm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Sliding wear: role of plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present experimental wear data for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sliding on tile, sandpaper, and polished steel surfaces, as well as for soda-lime, borosilicate, and quartz glass sliding on sandpaper. The results are compared with a recently developed theory \cite{ToBe} of sliding wear based on crack propagation (fatigue), originally formulated for elastic contact and here extended to include plasticity. The elastoplastic wear model predicts wear rates that agree reasonably well with the experimental results for PMMA and soda-lime glass. However, deviations observed for quartz suggest that material-specific deformation mechanisms, particularly the differences between crystalline and amorphous structures, may need to be considered for accurate wear predictions across different materials. In addition, the model reveals a non-monotonic dependence of the wear rate on the penetration hardness $\sigma_{\rm P}$. Thus, for plastically soft material, the wear rate increases with increasing $\sigma_{\rm P}$, while for hard materials, it decreases. This contrasts with Archard's wear law, where the wear rate decreases monotonically with increasing $\sigma_{\rm P}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the expansion of silicon photonics from datacom applications into emerging fields like optical I/O, quantum and programmable photonics there is an increasing demand for devices that combine ultra-compact footprints, low losses, and broad bandwidths. While inverse design techniques have proven very efficient in achieving small footprints, they often underutilize physical insight and rely on large parameter spaces that are challenging to explore, thereby limiting the performance of the resulting devices. Here we present a design methodology that combines inverse design with a topology based on cells, each of which contains a subwavelength metamaterial. This approach significantly reduces the parameter space, while the inherent anisotropy of the subwavelength structures yields shorter devices. We experimentally demonstrate our technique with an ultra-compact spot size converter that achieves a x24 expansion ratio times (from 0.5 um to 12 um) over a length of only 7 um, with insertion losses of 0.8 dB across a measured bandwidth of 160 nm (up to 300 nm in simulation), surpassing the state-of-the-art by a wide margin.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are limited to a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, compromising effective response and risk assessment. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration for any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event predictions of the spectrometer's response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Validation in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios demonstrates that the model not only addresses major deficiencies of previous approaches but also achieves the accuracy required to supersede empirical calibration methods. This advancement enables high-fidelity spectral signature generation for any gamma-ray source, reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity sources, and eliminates related radioactive waste. The approach presented here is a critical step toward integrating advanced full-spectrum data reduction methods for AGRS, unlocking new capabilities beyond emergency response, such as atmospheric cosmic-ray flux quantification for geophysics and trace-level airborne radionuclide identification for nuclear security.</description>

      <title>Above-room-temperature multiferroic tunnel junction with altermagnetic CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets with non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room-temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, non-ferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308 %, TER of 707 %, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic-sensing and quantum logic nano-devices.</description>

Abstract: In preparation for operation of multiple Rare Isotope Beams (RIBs) when the Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory (ARIEL) becomes operational, TRIUMF embarked on a program of advanced beam tuning applications and machine learning tools. The strategy for operationalzing Bayesian Optimization for beam steering purposes is being developed. A previously reported centroid correction algorithm is used to tune accelerated charged particle beams at TRIUMF's ISAC postaccelerator facility. We present findings and results from multiple machine development experiments conducted between October and November 2024, as part of a pivot toward semi-automated machine tuning methods. These findings were instrumental in shaping the tuning strategy for the medium and high energy beam transport (MEBT, HEBT) lines at ISAC, by sequentially optimizing sub-sections of the beamlines.</description>
