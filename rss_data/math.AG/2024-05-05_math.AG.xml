      <title>The Hurwitz tree obstruction for the refined local lifting problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we formulate the differential Hurwitz tree obstructions for the refined local lifting problem. We specifically explore the circumstances under which these obstructions vanish for cyclic covers. The constructions presented in this paper will be used to address the refined local lifting problem in our forthcoming works.</description>

      <title>Local cohomology with support in Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with local cohomology sheaves on generalized flag varieties supported in closed Schubert varieties, which carry natural structures as (mixed Hodge) D-modules. We employ Kazhdan--Lusztig theory and Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to describe a general strategy to calculate the simple composition factors, Hodge filtration, and weight filtration on these modules. Our main tool is the Grothendieck--Cousin complex, introduced by Kempf, which allows us to relate the local cohomology modules in question to parabolic Verma modules over the corresponding Lie algebra. We show that this complex underlies a complex of mixed Hodge modules, and is thus endowed with Hodge and weight filtrations. As a consequence, strictness implies that computing cohomology commutes with taking associated graded with respect to both of these filtrations. We execute this strategy to calculate the composition factors and weight filtration for Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian, in particular showing that the weight filtration is controlled by the augmented Dyck patterns of Raicu--Weyman. As an application, upon restriction to the opposite big cell, we recover the simple composition factors and weight filtration on local cohomology with support in generic determinantal varieties.</description>

      <title>Gotzmann's persistence theorem for smooth projective toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gotzmann's persistence theorem enables us to confirm the Hilbert polynomial of a subscheme of projective space by checking the Hilbert function in just two points, regardless of the dimension of the ambient space. We generalise this result to products of projective spaces, and then extend our result to any smooth projective toric variety. In the case of products of projective spaces, the number of points depends solely on the Picard rank of the ambient space, rather than on the dimension. For a more general smooth projective toric variety this number depends on the number of Hilbert basis elements of the nef cone.</description>

      <title>Orbits and invariants for coisotropy representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a subgroup $H$ of a reductive group $G$, let $\mathfrak m\subset \mathfrak g^*$ be the cotangent space of $eH\in G/H$. The linear action $(H:\mathfrak m)$ is the coisotropy representation. It is known that the complexity and rank of $G/H$ (denoted $c$ and $r$, respectively) are encoded in properties of $(H:\mathfrak m)$. We complement existing results on $c$, $r$, and $(H:\mathfrak m)$, especially for quasiaffine varieties $G/H$. If the algebra of invariants $k[\mathfrak m]^H$ is finitely generated, then we establish a connection between the nullcones in $\mathfrak m$ and $\mathfrak g^*$. Two other topics considered are (i) a relationship between varieties $G/H$ of complexity at most 1 and the homological dimension of the algebra of invariants $k[\mathfrak m]^H$ and (ii) the Poisson structure of $k[\mathfrak m]^H$ and Poisson-commutative subalgebras in $k[\mathfrak m]^H$ with maximal transcendence degree.</description>

      <title>Embeddings and disjunction of Lagrangian pinwheels via rational blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the symplectic rational blow-up to study some Lagrangian pinwheels in symplectic rational manifolds. In particular, we determine which symplectic forms in the threefold blow-up of $\C P^2$ carry Lagrangian projective planes that can be made disjoint by a Hamiltonian isotopy. In addition, we show that such a disjunction is not possible in del Pezzo surfaces with Euler characteristic between $4$ and $7$. Finally, we determine which symplectic forms on $S^2\times S^2$ carry a Lagrangian $L_{3,1}$ pinwheel, answering a question of J. Evans.</description>

      <title>Zilber's Trichotomy in Hausdorff Geometric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new axiomatic treatment of the Zilber trichotomy, and use it to complete the proof of the trichotomy for relics of algebraically closed fields, i.e., reducts of the ACF-induced structure on ACF-definable sets. More precisely, we introduce a class of geometric structures equipped with a Hausdorff topology, called \textit{Hausdorff geometric structures}. Natural examples include the complex field; algebraically closed valued fields; o-minimal expansions of real closed fields; and characteristic zero Henselian fields (in particular $p$-adically closed fields). We then study the Zilber trichotomy for relics of Hausdorff geometric structures, showing that under additional assumptions, every non-locally modular strongly minimal relic on a real sort interprets a one-dimensional group. Combined with recent results, this allows us to prove the trichotomy for strongly minimal relics on the real sorts of algebraically closed valued fields.
  Finally, we make progress on the imaginary sorts, reducing the trichotomy for \textit{all} ACVF relics (in all sorts) to a conjectural technical condition that we prove in characteristic $(0,0)$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for various polarized varieties over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, which broadly includes K-trivial case, K-ample case, Fano case, minimal models, certain classes of fibrations, certain metrized "minimal-like" models minimizes the Arakelov theoretic analogue of the Mabuchi K-energy, as conjectured in [Od15]. This is an Arakelov theoretic analogue of [H22b].</description>

      <title>Topological characterization and Hodge structures of some rationally elliptic K\"ahler fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the rationally elliptic K\"ahler fourfolds which are holomorphically embedding into the complex projective eight-space $\mathbb{P}^8$. It is proved that a simply-connected $\mathbb Q$-homological projective four-space $X\subset\mathbb{P}^8$ is biholomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^4$ by using Euler characteristic and Chern numbers formulae of the normal bundle for a holomorphic embedding $i:X \to\mathbb{P}^8$. Wilson asked whether a $\mathbb Q$-homological projective $n$-space $X$ with Kodaira dimension $k(X)\neq n$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^n$. We give a positive answer for this question in dimension $4$. Using the same idea, we show that the Hodge conjecture holds for the rationally elliptic fourfold $X \subset\mathbb{P}^8$, and the rationally elliptic fourfold $X \subset\mathbb{P}^8$ has non-positive Hodge level.</description>

      <title>Examples of non-rigid, modular vector bundles on hyperk\"ahler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit examples of slope-stable and modular vector bundles on a hyperk\"ahler manifold of K3$^{[2]}$-type which move in a 20-dimensional family and study their algebraic properties. These are obtained by performing standard linear algebra constructions on the examples studied by O'Grady of (rigid) modular bundles on the Fano varieties of lines of a general cubic 4-fold and the Debarre-Voisin hyperk\"ahler manifold.</description>

      <title>Pl\"ucker formulas using equivariant cohomology of coincident root strata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new method to calculate the universal cohomology classes of coincident root loci. We show a polynomial behavior of them and apply this result to prove that generalized Pl\"ucker formulas are polynomials in the degree, just as the classical Pl\"ucker formulas counting the bitangents and flexes of a degree $d$ generic plane curve. We establish an upper bound for the degrees of these polynomials, and we calculate the leading terms of those whose degrees reach this upper bound.
  We believe that the paper is understandable without detailed knowledge of equivariant cohomology. It may serve as a demonstration of the use of equivariant cohomology in enumerative geometry through the examples of coincident root strata. We also explain how the equivariant method can be "translated" into the traditional non-equivariant method of resolutions.</description>

      <title>Complexity in Tame Quantum Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the notion that physical systems can contain only a finite amount of information or complexity, we introduce a framework that allows for quantifying the amount of logical information needed to specify a function or set. We then apply this methodology to a variety of physical systems and derive the complexity of parameter-dependent physical observables and coupling functions appearing in effective Lagrangians. In order to implement these ideas, it is essential to consider physical theories that can be defined in an o-minimal structure. O-minimality, a concept from mathematical logic, encapsulates a tameness principle. It was recently argued that this property is inherent to many known quantum field theories and is linked to the UV completion of the theory. To assign a complexity to each statement in these theories one has to further constrain the allowed o-minimal structures. To exemplify this, we show that many physical systems can be formulated using Pfaffian o-minimal structures, which have a well-established notion of complexity. More generally, we propose adopting sharply o-minimal structures, recently introduced by Binyamini and Novikov, as an overarching framework to measure complexity in quantum theories.</description>
