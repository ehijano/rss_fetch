      <title>Arithmetic of cuts in ordered abelian groups and of ideals over valuation rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate existence, uniqueness and maximality of solutions $T$ for equations $S_1+T=S_2$ and inequalities $S_1+T\subseteq S_2$ where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are final segments of ordered abelian groups. Since cuts are determined by their upper cut sets, which are final segments, this gives information about the corresponding equalities and inequalities for cuts. We apply our results to investigate existence, uniqueness and maximality of solutions $J$ for equations $I_1 J=I_2$ and inequalities $I_1 J\subseteq I_2$ where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are ideals of valuation rings. This enables us to compute the annihilators of quotients of the form $I_1/I_2\,$.</description>

      <title>Virtually regular modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a right module $M$ (strongly) virtually regular if every (finitely generated) cyclic submodule is isomorphic to a direct summand. $M$ is said to be completely virtually regular if every submodule is virtually regular. In this paper, characterizations and some closure properties of the aforementioned modules are given. Several structure results are obtained over commutative rings. In particular, the structures of finitely presented (strongly) virtually regular modules and completely virtually regular modules are fully determined over valuation domains. Namely, for a valuation domain $R$ with the unique maximal ideal $P$, we show that finitely presented (strongly) virtually regular modules are free if and only if $P$ is not principal; and that $P=Rp$ is principal if and only if finitely presented virtually regular modules are of the form $$R^n \oplus (\frac{R}{Rp})^{n_1} \oplus (\frac{R}{Rp^2})^{n_2} \oplus \cdots \oplus (\frac{R}{Rp^k})^{n_k}$$ for nonnegative integers $n,\,k,\,n_1,\,n_2,\cdots ,n_k.$ Similarly, we prove that $P=Rp$ is principal if and only if finitely presented strongly virtually regular modules are of the form $ R^n \oplus (\frac{R}{Rp})^{m}$, where $m,n$ are nonnegative integers.
  We also obtain that, $R$ admits a nonzero finitely presented completely virtually regular module $M$ if and only if $P=Rp$ is principal. Moreover, for a finitely presented $R$-module $M$, we prove that: $(i)$ if $R$ is not a DVR, then $M$ is completely virtually regular if and only if $M \cong (\frac{R}{Rp})^{m}$; and $(ii)$ if $R$ is a DVR, then $M$ is completely virtually regular if and only if $M\cong R^n \oplus (\frac{R}{Rp})^{m}.$ Finally, we obtain a characterization of finitely generated virtually regular modules over the ring of integers.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of commutative semisimple finite group algebras using the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $G$ be a finite abelian group with order coprime to $q$. We present a full decomposition of the semisimple group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[G]$. This was achieved by studying algebraic properties of coordinate rings of the form $\mathbb{F}_q[X_1, \ldots ,X_n] / ( X_1^{m_1} - 1, \ldots, X_n^{m_n} - 1 )$, which omits the use of finding primitive idempotents and character theory. We discuss some properties of this decomposition, like providing a formula for the number of simple components. Moreover, we discuss some applications in cryptography, and the classification of all irreducible representations of $G$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ up to isomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of arbitrary characteristic. We prove the following:
  $\bullet$ Let $B=k^{[3]}$ and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}(B)$ be non-trivial. If the plinth ideal $(\mathrm{pl} (\delta))$ contains a quasi-basic element, then the ring of invariants ($B^{\delta}$) is $k^{[2]}$.
  $\bullet$ Let $B=R^{[n]}$, where $R$ is a $k$-domain and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}_R(B)$ is a triangular exponential map. Then $B^{\delta}$ is non-rigid.
  We prove the following results for a $k$-domain $R$ when the characteristic of $k$ is zero:
  $\bullet$ The kernel of any triangular $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.
  $\bullet$ The kernel of any linear locally nilpotent $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.</description>

      <title>Products and powers of principal symmetric ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Principal symmetric ideals were recently introduced by Harada, Seceleanu, and Sega, with a focus on their homological properties. They are ideals generated by the orbit of a single polynomial under permutations of variables in a polynomial ring. In this paper we seek to determine when a product of two principal symmetric ideals is principal symmetric and when all the powers of a principal symmetric ideal are again principal symmetric ideals. We characterize the ideals that have the latter property as being generated by polynomials invariant up to a scalar multiple under permutation of variables. Recognizing principal symmetric ideals is an open question for the purpose of which we produce certain obstructions. We also demonstrate that the Hilbert functions of symmetric monomial ideals are not all given by symmetric monomial ideals, in contrast to the non-symmetric case.</description>

      <title>Degree bounds for rational generators of invariant fields of finite abelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study degree bounds on rational but not necessarily polynomial generators for the field $\mathbf{k}(V)^G$ of rational invariants of a linear action of a finite abelian group. We show that lattice-theoretic methods used recently by the author and collaborators to study polynomial generators for the same field largely carry over, after minor modifications to the arguments. It then develops that the specific degree bounds found in that setting also carry over.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic of D-Algebraic Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the arithmetic of solutions to ordinary or partial nonlinear differential equations which are algebraic in the indeterminates and their derivatives. We call these solutions D-algebraic functions, and their equations are algebraic (ordinary or partial) differential equations (ADEs). The general purpose is to find ADEs whose solutions contain specified rational expressions of solutions to given ADEs. For univariate D-algebraic functions, we show how to derive an ADE of smallest possible order. In the multivariate case, we introduce a general algorithm for these computations and derive conclusions on the order bound of the resulting algebraic PDE. Using our accompanying Maple software, we discuss applications in physics, statistics, and symbolic integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Green-Lazarsfeld Secant Conjecture is a generalization of Green's Conjecture on syzygies of canonical curves to the cases of arbitrary line bundles. We establish the Green-Lazarsfeld Secant Conjecture for curves of genus g in all the divisorial case, that is, when the line bundles that fail to be (p+1)-very ample form a divisor in the Jacobian of the curve.</description>

      <title>Standard Monomials for Positroid Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit characterization of the standard monomials for positroid varieties with respect to the Hodge degeneration and give a Gr\"obner basis. Furthermore, we show that promotion and evacuation biject standard monomials of a positroid variety with those of its cyclic shifts and $w_0$-reflection, respectively. The connection to promotion allows us to identify standard monomials of a positroid variety with Lam's cyclic Demazure crystal. Using a recurrence on the Hilbert series, we give an inductive formula for the character of cyclic Demazure modules.</description>

      <title>Results on left-right approximation for k-Nash morphisms and for k-analytic morphisms of weakly finite singularity type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard Artin approximation (AP) is not readily applicable to the left-right equivalence of morphisms Maps((k^n,o),(k^m,o)). Moreover, the na\"ive extension does not hold in the k-analytic case, because of Osgood-Gabrielov-Shiota examples.
  The left-right version of Artin approximation (LRAP) was established by M. Shiota for morphisms that are either Nash or [real-analytic and of finite singularity type]. We establish LRAP and its stronger version of P{\l}oski (LRAPP) for Maps(X,Y) where X,Y are k-analytic/k-Nash germs of schemes of any characteristic.
  More precisely:
  *(k-algebraic power series, k&lt;x&gt;/J_X and k&lt;y&gt;/J_Y) LRAP, LRAPP, the inverse Artin approximation (and its P{\l}oski's version) hold for any morphism.
  *(k-analytic power series, k{x}/J_X and k{y}/J_Y) LRAP, LRAPP, the inverse Artin approximation (and its P{\l}oski's version) hold for finite morphisms.
  * LRAP holds for analytic morphisms of weakly-finite singularity type.
  This later class of morphisms of ``weakly-finite singularity type" (which we introduce) is of separate importance. It extends naturally the class of morphisms of ``finite singularity type", while preserving their non-pathological behaviour. The definition goes via the higher critical loci of morphisms with singular target. (The critical locus Crit_X f is defined via the Zariski-Lipman sequence.)
  We establish basic properties of these critical loci. In particular: any map is finitely (right) determined by its higher singular loci.</description>

      <title>On Rational Recursion for Holonomic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently conjectured that every component of a discrete-time rational dynamical system is a solution to an algebraic difference equation that is linear in its highest-shift term (a quasi-linear equation). We prove that the conjecture holds in the special case of holonomic sequences, which can straightforwardly be represented by rational dynamical systems. We propose two algorithms for converting holonomic recurrence equations into such quasi-linear equations. The two algorithms differ in their efficiency and the minimality of orders in their outputs.</description>

      <title>Linear equations with monomial constraints and decision problems in abelian-by-cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is undecidable whether a system of linear equations over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$ admit solutions where a specified subset of variables take value in the set of monomials $\{X^z \mid z \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. In particular, we construct a finitely presented $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$-module, where it is undecidable whether a linear equation $X^{z_1} \boldsymbol{f}_1 + \cdots + X^{z_n} \boldsymbol{f}_n = \boldsymbol{f}_0$ has solutions $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This contrasts the decidability of the case $n = 1$, which can be deduced from Noskov's Lemma.
  We apply this result to settle a number of problems in computational group theory. We show that it is undecidable whether a system of equations has solutions in the wreath product $\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z}$, providing a negative answer to an open problem of Kharlampovich, L\'{o}pez and Miasnikov (2020). We show that there exists a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group in which the problem of solving a single quadratic equation is undecidable. We also construct a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group, different to that of Mishchenko and Treier (2017), in which the Knapsack Problem is undecidable. In contrast, we show that the problem of Coset Intersection is decidable in all finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic groups.</description>
