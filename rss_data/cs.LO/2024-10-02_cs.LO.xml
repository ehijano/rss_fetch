      <title>Conway Normal Form: Bridging Approaches for Comprehensive Formalization of Surreal Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper class of Conway's surreal numbers forms a rich totally ordered algebraically closed field with many arithmetic and algebraic properties close to those of real numbers, the ordinals, and infinitesimal numbers. In this paper, we formalize the construction of Conway's numbers in Mizar using two approaches and propose a bridge between them, aiming to combine their advantages for efficient formalization. By replacing transfinite induction-recursion with transfinite induction, we streamline their construction. Additionally, we introduce a method to merge proofs from both approaches using global choice, facilitating formal proof. We demonstrate that surreal numbers form a field, including the square root, and that they encompass subsets such as reals, ordinals, and powers of $\omega$. We combined Conway's work with Ehrlich's generalization to formally prove Conway's Normal Form, paving the way for many formal developments in surreal number theory.</description>

      <title>Partial Typing for Asynchronous Multiparty Sessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal verification methods for concurrent systems cannot always be scaled-down or tailored in order to be applied on specific subsystems. We address such an issue in a MultiParty Session Types setting by devising a partial type assignment system for multiparty sessions (i.e. sets of concurrent participants) with asynchronous communications. Sessions are possibly typed by "asynchronous global types" describing the overall behaviour of specific subsets of participants only (from which the word "partial"). Typability is proven to ensure  that sessions enjoy  the partial versions of the well-known properties of lock- and orphan-message-freedom. </description>

      <title>From Compactifying Lambda-Letrec Terms to Recognizing Regular-Expression Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a supplement to my talk at the workshop, this extended abstract motivates and summarizes my work with co-authors on problems in two separate areas: first, in the lambda-calculus with letrec, a universal model of computation, and second, on Milner's process interpretation of regular expressions, a proper subclass of the finite-state processes. The aim of my talk was to motivate a transferal of ideas for workable concepts of structure-constrained graphs: from the problem of finding compact graph representations for terms in the lambda-calculus with letrec to the problem of recognizing finite process graphs that can be expressed by regular expressions. In both cases the construction of structure-constrained graphs was expedient in order to enable to go back and forth easily between, in the first case, lambda-terms and term graphs, and in the second case, regular expressions and process graphs.      
  The main focus here is on providing pointers to my work with co-authors, in both areas separately. A secondary focus is on explaining directions of my present projects, and describing research questions of possibly general interest that have developed out of my work in these two areas.</description>

      <title>When Do You Start Counting? Revisiting Counting and Pnueli Modalities in Timed Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pnueli first noticed that certain simple 'counting' properties appear to be inexpressible in popular timed temporal logics such as Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL). This interesting observation has since been studied extensively, culminating in strong timed logics that are capable of expressing such properties yet remain decidable. A slightly more general case, namely where one asserts the existence of a sequence of events in an arbitrary interval of the form &lt;a, b&gt; (instead of an upper-bound interval of the form [0, b&gt;, which starts from the current point in time), has however not been addressed satisfactorily in the existing literature. We show that counting in [0, b&gt; is in fact as powerful as counting in &lt;a, b&gt;; moreover, the general property 'there exist x', x'' in I such that x' &lt;= x'' and phi(x', x'') holds' can be expressed in Extended Metric Interval Temporal Logic (EMITL) with only [0, b&gt;.</description>

      <title>Random Graph Generation in Context-Free Graph Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for generating random hypergraphs in context-free hypergraph languages. It is obtained by adapting Mairson's generation algorithm for context-free string grammars to the setting of hyperedge replacement grammars. Our main results are that for non-ambiguous hyperedge replacement grammars, the method generates hypergraphs uniformly at random and in quadratic time. We illustrate our approach by a running example of a hyperedge replacement grammar generating term graphs.</description>

      <title>Fibrational perspectives on determinization of finite-state automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colcombet and Petri\c{s}an argued that automata may be usefully considered from a functorial perspective, introducing a general notion of "$\mathcal{V}$-automaton" based on functors into $\mathcal{V}$. This enables them to recover different standard notions of automata by choosing $\mathcal{V}$ appropriately, and they further analyzed the determinization for \textbf{Rel}-automata using the Kleisli adjunction between \textbf{Set} and \textbf{Rel}. In this paper, we revisit Colcombet and Petri\c{s}an's analysis from a fibrational perspective, building on Melli\`es and Zeilberger's recent alternative but related definition of categorical automata as functors $p : \mathcal{Q} \to \mathcal{C}$ satisfying the finitary fiber and unique lifting of factorizations property. In doing so, we improve the understanding of determinization in three regards: Firstly, we carefully describe the universal property of determinization in terms of forward-backward simulations. Secondly, we generalize the determinization procedure for \textbf{Rel} automata using a local adjunction between \textbf{SpanSet} and \textbf{Rel}, which provides us with a canonical forward simulation. Finally we also propose an alterative determinization based on the multiset relative adjunction which retains paths, and we leverage this to provide a canonical forward-backward simulation.</description>

      <title>User-Guided Verification of Security Protocols via Sound Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current formal verification of security protocols relies on specialized researchers and complex tools, inaccessible to protocol designers who informally evaluate their work with emulators. This paper addresses this gap by embedding symbolic analysis into the design process. Our approach implements the Dolev-Yao attack model using a variant of CSP based on Interaction Trees (ITrees) to compile protocols into animators -- executable programs that designers can use for debugging and inspection. To guarantee the soundness of our compilation, we mechanised our approach in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. As traditionally done with symbolic tools, we refer to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Needham-Schroeder public-key protocol (and Lowe's patched variant). We demonstrate how our animator can easily reveal the mechanics of attacks and verify corrections. This work facilitates security integration at the design level and supports further security property analysis and software-engineered integrations.</description>

      <title>LTLf Synthesis on First-Order Action Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Golog is an expressive high-level agent language that includes nondeterministic operators which allow to leave some of the decisions to be made only at execution time. This so-called program realization is typically implemented by means of search, or in an incremental online fashion. In this paper, we consider the more realistic case where parts of the non-determinism are under the control of the environment. Program realization then becomes a synthesis problem, where a successful realization executes the program and satisfies the temporal goal for all possible environment actions. We consider Golog programs in combination with an expressive class of first-order action theories that allow for an unbounded number of objects and non-local effects, together with a temporal goal specified in a first-order extension of LTLf. We solve the synthesis problem by constructing a game arena that captures all possible executions of the program while tracking the satisfaction of the temporal goal and then solving the resulting two-player game. We evaluate the approach in two domains, showing the general feasibility of the approach.</description>

      <title>A Complete Inference System for Skip-free Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT) is a fragment of Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT) that was recently introduced to reason efficiently about imperative programs. In contrast to KAT, GKAT does not have an algebraic axiomatization, but relies on an analogue of Salomaa's axiomatization of Kleene Algebra. In this paper, we present an algebraic axiomatization and prove two completeness results for a large fragment of GKAT consisting of skip-free programs.</description>

      <title>About the Expressive Power and Complexity of Order-Invariance with Two Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Order-invariant first-order logic is an extension of first-order logic (FO) where formulae can make use of a linear order on the structures, under the proviso that they are order-invariant, i.e. that their truth value is the same for all linear orders. We continue the study of the two-variable fragment of order-invariant first-order logic initiated by Zeume and Harwath, and study its complexity and expressive power. We first establish coNExpTime-completeness for the problem of deciding if a given two-variable formula is order-invariant, which tightens and significantly simplifies the coN2ExpTime proof by Zeume and Harwath. Second, we address the question of whether every property expressible in order-invariant two-variable logic is also expressible in first-order logic without the use of a linear order. While we were not able to provide a satisfactory answer to the question, we suspect that the answer is ``no''. To justify our claim, we present a class of finite tree-like structures (of unbounded degree) in which a relaxed variant of order-invariant two-variable FO expresses properties that are not definable in plain FO. On the other hand, we show that if one restricts their attention to classes of structures of bounded degree, then the expressive power of order-invariant two-variable FO is contained within FO.</description>

      <title>Logic Programming with Multiplicative Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the logic programming paradigm, a program is defined by a set of methods, each of which can be executed when specific conditions are met during the current state of an execution. The semantics of these programs can be elegantly represented using sequent calculi, in which each method is linked to an inference rule. In this context, proof search mirrors the program's execution. Previous works introduced a framework in which the process of constructing proof nets is employed to model executions, as opposed to the traditional approach of proof search in sequent calculus.
  This paper further extends this investigation by focussing on the pure multiplicative fragment of this framework. We demonstrate, providing practical examples, the capability to define logic programming methods with context-sensitive behaviors solely through specific resource-preserving and context-free operations, corresponding to certain generalized multiplicative connectives explored in existing literature. We show how some of these methods, although still multiplicative, escape the purely multiplicative fragment of Linear Logic (MLL).</description>

      <title>Automating Semantic Analysis of System Assurance Cases using Goal-directed ASP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11699v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assurance cases offer a structured way to present arguments and evidence for certification of systems where safety and security are critical. However, creating and evaluating these assurance cases can be complex and challenging, even for systems of moderate complexity. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop new automation methods for these tasks. While most existing assurance case tools focus on automating structural aspects, they lack the ability to fully assess the semantic coherence and correctness of the assurance arguments.
  In prior work, we introduced the Assurance 2.0 framework that prioritizes the reasoning process, evidence utilization, and explicit delineation of counter-claims (defeaters) and counter-evidence. In this paper, we present our approach to enhancing Assurance 2.0 with semantic rule-based analysis capabilities using common-sense reasoning and answer set programming solvers, specifically s(CASP). By employing these analysis techniques, we examine the unique semantic aspects of assurance cases, such as logical consistency, adequacy, indefeasibility, etc. The application of these analyses provides both system developers and evaluators with increased confidence about the assurance case.</description>

      <title>A Simple Algorithm for Consistent Query Answering under Primary Keys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08482v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dichotomy conjecture for consistent query answering under primary key constraints. It states that, for every fixed Boolean conjunctive query q, testing whether q is certain (i.e. whether it evaluates to true over all repairs of a given inconsistent database) is either polynomial time or coNP-complete. This conjecture has been verified for self-join-free and path queries.
  We propose a simple inflationary fixpoint algorithm for consistent query answering which, for a given database, naively computes a set $\Delta$ of subsets of facts of the database of size at most k, where k is the size of the query q. The algorithm runs in polynomial time and can be formally defined as: (1) Initialize $\Delta$ with all sets $S$ of at most $k$ facts such that $S\models q$. (2) Add any set $S$ of at most k facts to $\Delta$ if there exists a block $B$ (i.e., a maximal set of facts sharing the same key) such that for every fact $a \in B$ there is a set $S' \subseteq S \cup \{a\}$ such that $S'\in \Delta$.
  For an input database $D$, the algorithm answers "q is certain" iff $\Delta$ eventually contains the empty set. The algorithm correctly computes certainty when the query q falls in the polynomial time cases of the known dichotomies for self-join-free queries and path queries. For arbitrary Boolean conjunctive queries, the algorithm is an under-approximation: the query is guaranteed to be certain if the algorithm claims so. However, there are polynomial time certain queries (with self-joins) which are not identified as such by the algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We define game semantics for the constructive $\mu$-calculus and prove its equivalence to bi-relational semantics. As an application, we use the game semantics to prove that the $\mu$-calculus collapses to modal logic over the modal logic $\mathsf{IS5}$. We then show the completeness of $\mathsf{IS5}$ extended with fixed-point operators.</description>
