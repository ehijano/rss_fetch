      <title>RealOSR: Latent Unfolding Boosting Diffusion-based Real-world Omnidirectional Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omnidirectional image super-resolution (ODISR) aims to upscale low-resolution (LR) omnidirectional images (ODIs) to high-resolution (HR), addressing the growing demand for detailed visual content across a $180^{\circ}\times360^{\circ}$ viewport. Existing methods are limited by simple degradation assumptions (e.g., bicubic downsampling), which fail to capture the complex, unknown real-world degradation processes. Recent diffusion-based approaches suffer from slow inference due to their hundreds of sampling steps and frequent pixel-latent space conversions. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose RealOSR, a novel diffusion-based approach for real-world ODISR (Real-ODISR) with single-step diffusion denoising. To sufficiently exploit the input information, RealOSR introduces a lightweight domain alignment module, which facilitates the efficient injection of LR ODI into the single-step latent denoising. Additionally, to better utilize the rich semantic and multi-scale feature modeling ability of denoising UNet, we develop a latent unfolding module that simulates the gradient descent process directly in latent space. Experimental results demonstrate that RealOSR outperforms previous methods in both ODI recovery quality and efficiency. Compared to the recent state-of-the-art diffusion-based ODISR method, OmniSSR, RealOSR achieves significant improvements in visual quality and over \textbf{200$\times$} inference acceleration. Our code and models will be released.</description>

      <title>DSplats: 3D Generation by Denoising Splats-Based Multiview Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D content requires models capable of learning robust distributions of complex scenes and the real-world objects within them. Recent Gaussian-based 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved impressive results in recovering high-fidelity 3D assets from sparse input images by predicting 3D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. However, these techniques often lack the extensive priors and expressiveness offered by Diffusion Models. On the other hand, 2D Diffusion Models, which have been successfully applied to denoise multiview images, show potential for generating a wide range of photorealistic 3D outputs but still fall short on explicit 3D priors and consistency. In this work, we aim to bridge these two approaches by introducing DSplats, a novel method that directly denoises multiview images using Gaussian Splat-based Reconstructors to produce a diverse array of realistic 3D assets. To harness the extensive priors of 2D Diffusion Models, we incorporate a pretrained Latent Diffusion Model into the reconstructor backbone to predict a set of 3D Gaussians. Additionally, the explicit 3D representation embedded in the denoising network provides a strong inductive bias, ensuring geometrically consistent novel view generation. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DSplats not only produces high-quality, spatially consistent outputs, but also sets a new standard in single-image to 3D reconstruction. When evaluated on the Google Scanned Objects dataset, DSplats achieves a PSNR of 20.38, an SSIM of 0.842, and an LPIPS of 0.109.</description>

      <title>A Single-Frame and Multi-Frame Cascaded Image Super-Resolution Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of image super-resolution is to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image with the prior knowledge from one or several low-resolution (LR) images. However, in the real world, due to the limited complementary information, the performance of both single-frame and multi-frame super-resolution reconstruction degrades rapidly as the magnification increases. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step image super resolution method concatenating multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR) with single-frame super-resolution (SFSR), to progressively upsample images to the desired resolution. The proposed method consisting of an L0-norm constrained reconstruction scheme and an enhanced residual back-projection network, integrating the flexibility of the variational modelbased method and the feature learning capacity of the deep learning-based method. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments with both simulated and real world sequences were implemented. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields superior performance in both objective and perceptual quality measurements. The average PSNRs of the cascade model in set5 and set14 are 33.413 dB and 29.658 dB respectively, which are 0.76 dB and 0.621 dB more than the baseline method. In addition, the experiment indicates that this cascade model can be robustly applied to different SFSR and MFSR methods.</description>

      <title>Generating 3D Pseudo-Healthy Knee MR Images to Support Trochleoplasty Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Trochlear Dysplasia (TD) is a common malformation in adolescents, leading to anterior knee pain and instability. Surgical interventions such as trochleoplasty require precise planning to correct the trochlear groove. However, no standardized preoperative plan exists to guide surgeons in reshaping the femur. This study aims to generate patient-specific, pseudo-healthy MR images of the trochlear region that should theoretically align with the respective patient's patella, potentially supporting the pre-operative planning of trochleoplasty.
  Methods: We employ a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to generate personalized pseudo-healthy, anatomically plausible MR scans of the trochlear region. We train our model using knee MR scans of healthy subjects. During inference, we mask out pathological regions around the patella in scans of patients affected by TD, and replace them with their pseudo-healthy counterpart. An orthopedic surgeon measured the sulcus angle (SA), trochlear groove depth (TGD) and D\'ejour classification in MR scans before and after inpainting. The code is available at https://github.com/wehrlimi/Generate-Pseudo-Healthy-Knee-MRI .
  Results: The inpainting by our model significantly improves the SA, TGD and D\'ejour classification in a study with 49 knee MR scans.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of WDMs in providing surgeons with patient-specific guidance. By offering anatomically plausible MR scans, the method could potentially enhance the precision and preoperative planning of trochleoplasty, and pave the way to more minimally invasive surgeries.</description>

      <title>Cycle-Consistent Bridge Diffusion Model for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerated MRI reconstruction techniques aim to reduce examination time while maintaining high image fidelity, which is highly desirable in clinical settings for improving patient comfort and hospital efficiency. Existing deep learning methods typically reconstruct images from under-sampled data with traditional reconstruction approaches, but they still struggle to provide high-fidelity results. Diffusion models show great potential to improve fidelity of generated images in recent years. However, their inference process starting with a random Gaussian noise introduces instability into the results and usually requires thousands of sampling steps, resulting in sub-optimal reconstruction quality and low efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Cycle-Consistent Bridge Diffusion Model (CBDM). CBDM employs two bridge diffusion models to construct a cycle-consistent diffusion process with a consistency loss, enhancing the fine-grained details of reconstructed images and reducing the number of diffusion steps. Moreover, CBDM incorporates a Contourlet Decomposition Embedding Module (CDEM) which captures multi-scale structural texture knowledge in images through frequency domain decomposition pyramids and directional filter banks to improve structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model by higher reconstruction quality and fewer training iterations, achieving a new state of the art for accelerated MRI reconstruction in both fastMRI and IXI datasets.</description>

      <title>FM2S: Self-Supervised Fluorescence Microscopy Denoising With Single Noisy Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy has significantly advanced biological research by visualizing detailed cellular structures and biological processes. However, such image denoising task often faces challenges due to difficulty in precisely modeling the inherent noise and acquiring clean images for training, which constrains most existing methods. In this paper, we propose an efficient self-supervised denoiser Fluorescence Micrograph to Self (FM2S), enabling a high-quality denoised result with a single noisy image. Our method introduces an adaptive global-local Noise Addition module for data augmentation, addressing generalization problems caused by discrepancies between synthetic and real-world noise. We then train a two-layer neural network to learn the mapping from the noise-added image to the filtered image, achieving a balance between noise removal and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that FM2S excels in various microscope types and noise levels in terms of denoising effects and time consumption, obtaining an average PSNR improvement of around 6 dB over the original noisy image in a few seconds. The code is available at https://github.com/Danielement321/FM2S.</description>

      <title>A Cascaded Dilated Convolution Approach for Mpox Lesion Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global outbreak of Mpox virus, classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO, presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its visual similarity to other skin lesion diseases. Current clinical detection techniques face limitations in accuracy and efficiency, necessitating improved automated diagnostic solutions. This study introduces a novel Cascaded Atrous Group Attention (CAGA) module, specifically designed to enhance multi-scale feature representation while optimizing computational efficiency. By integrating CAGA with EfficientViT-L1 as the backbone architecture, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a score of 0.98% on the MCSI dataset, while reducing model parameters by 37.5% compared to the original EfficientViT-L1. This reduction in computational complexity maintains diagnostic accuracy while enabling broader deployment across resource-constrained healthcare settings. Extensive validation across two other benchmark datasets, including MSID and MSLD, demonstrate the model's robustness, consistently outperforming existing approaches. Our findings suggest that CAGA's efficient feature extraction mechanism could be adapted for other medical imaging tasks requiring fine-grained visual discrimination.</description>

      <title>Copy-Move Detection in Optical Microscopy: A Segmentation Network and A Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing revelations of academic fraud, detecting forged experimental images in the biomedical field has become a public concern. The challenge lies in the fact that copy-move targets can include background tissue, small foreground objects, or both, which may be out of the training domain and subject to unseen attacks, rendering standard object-detection-based approaches less effective. To address this, we reformulate the problem of detecting biomedical copy-move forgery regions as an intra-image co-saliency detection task and propose CMSeg-Net, a copy-move forgery segmentation network capable of identifying unseen duplicated areas. Built on a multi-resolution encoder-decoder architecture, CMSeg-Net incorporates self-correlation and correlation-assisted spatial-attention modules to detect intra-image regional similarities within feature tensors at each observation scale. This design helps distinguish even small copy-move targets in complex microscopic images from other similar objects. Furthermore, we created a copy-move forgery dataset of optical microscopic images, named FakeParaEgg, using open data from the ICIP 2022 Challenge to support CMSeg-Net's development and verify its performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the FakeParaEgg dataset and other open copy-move detection datasets, including CASIA-CMFD, CoMoFoD, and CMF. The FakeParaEgg dataset, our source code, and the CMF dataset with our manually defined segmentation ground truths available at ``https://github.com/YoursEver/FakeParaEgg''.</description>

      <title>Towards joint graph and sampling set selection from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the problem of sampling graph signals in scenarios where the graph structure is not predefined and must be inferred from data. In this scenario, existing approaches rely on a two-step process, where a graph is learned first, followed by sampling. More generally, graph learning and graph signal sampling have been studied as two independent problems in the literature. This work provides a foundational step towards jointly optimizing the graph structure and sampling set. Our main contribution, Vertex Importance Sampling (VIS), is to show that the sampling set can be effectively determined from the vertex importance (node weights) obtained from graph learning. We further propose Vertex Importance Sampling with Repulsion (VISR), a greedy algorithm where spatially -separated "important" nodes are selected to ensure better reconstruction. Empirical results on simulated data show that sampling using VIS and VISR leads to competitive reconstruction performance and lower complexity than the conventional two-step approach of graph learning followed by graph sampling.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution for Remote Sensing Imagery via the Coupling of a Variational Model and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) is an effective way to enhance the spatial resolution and detail information of remote sensing images, to obtain a superior visual quality. As SR is severely ill-conditioned, effective image priors are necessary to regularize the solution space and generate the corresponding high-resolution (HR) image. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient-guided multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR) framework for remote sensing imagery reconstruction. The framework integrates a learned gradient prior as the regularization term into a model-based optimization method. Specifically, the local gradient regularization (LGR) prior is derived from the deep residual attention network (DRAN) through gradient profile transformation. The non-local total variation (NLTV) prior is characterized using the spatial structure similarity of the gradient patches with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) model. The modeled prior performs well in preserving edge smoothness and suppressing visual artifacts, while the learned prior is effective in enhancing sharp edges and recovering fine structures. By incorporating the two complementary priors into an adaptive norm based reconstruction framework, the mixed L1 and L2 regularization minimization problem is optimized to achieve the required HR remote sensing image. Extensive experimental results on remote sensing data demonstrate that the proposed method can produce visually pleasant images and is superior to several of the state-of-the-art SR algorithms in terms of the quantitative evaluation.</description>

      <title>LinGen: Towards High-Resolution Minute-Length Text-to-Video Generation with Linear Computational Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation enhances content creation but is highly computationally intensive: The computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) scales quadratically in the number of pixels. This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction. Furthermore, both automatic metrics and human evaluation demonstrate our LinGen-4B yields comparable video quality to state-of-the-art models (with a 50.5%, 52.1%, 49.1% win rate with respect to Gen-3, LumaLabs, and Kling, respectively). This paves the way to hour-length movie generation and real-time interactive video generation. We provide 68s video generation results and more examples in our project website: https://lineargen.github.io/.</description>

      <title>T-GMSI: A transformer-based generative model for spatial interpolation under sparse measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating continuous environmental models from sparsely sampled data is a critical challenge in spatial modeling, particularly for topography. Traditional spatial interpolation methods often struggle with handling sparse measurements. To address this, we propose a Transformer-based Generative Model for Spatial Interpolation (T-GMSI) using a vision transformer (ViT) architecture for digital elevation model (DEM) generation under sparse conditions. T-GMSI replaces traditional convolution-based methods with ViT for feature extraction and DEM interpolation while incorporating a terrain feature-aware loss function for enhanced accuracy. T-GMSI excels in producing high-quality elevation surfaces from datasets with over 70% sparsity and demonstrates strong transferability across diverse landscapes without fine-tuning. Its performance is validated through extensive experiments, outperforming traditional methods such as ordinary Kriging (OK) and natural neighbor (NN) and a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)-based model (CEDGAN). Compared to OK and NN, T-GMSI reduces root mean square error (RMSE) by 40% and 25% on airborne lidar data and by 23% and 10% on spaceborne lidar data. Against CEDGAN, T-GMSI achieves a 20% RMSE improvement on provided DEM data, requiring no fine-tuning. The ability of model on generalizing to large, unseen terrains underscores its transferability and potential applicability beyond topographic modeling. This research establishes T-GMSI as a state-of-the-art solution for spatial interpolation on sparse datasets and highlights its broader utility for other sparse data interpolation challenges.</description>

To ensure end-to-end training, the noise layer in the framework must be differentiable. However, real-world distortions are often non-differentiable, leading to challenges in end-to-end training. Existing solutions only treat the distortion perturbation as additive noise, which does not fully integrate the effect of distortion in training. To better incorporate non-differentiable distortions into training, we propose a novel dual-decoder architecture (END$^2$). Unlike conventional END architecture, our method employs two structurally identical decoders: the Teacher Decoder, processing pure watermarked images, and the Student Decoder, handling distortion-perturbed images. The gradient is backpropagated only through the Teacher Decoder branch to optimize the encoder thus bypassing the problem of non-differentiability. To ensure resistance to arbitrary distortions, we enforce alignment of the two decoders' feature representations by maximizing the cosine similarity between their intermediate vectors on a hypersphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under various non-differentiable distortions. Moreover, even without the differentiability constraint, our method surpasses baselines with a differentiable noise layer. Our approach is effective and easily implementable across all END architectures, enhancing practicality and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness of Bottleneck Injected Deep Neural Networks for Task-Oriented Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using Information Bottleneck (IB) objectives for task-oriented communication systems. We empirically demonstrate that while IB-based approaches provide baseline resilience against attacks targeting downstream tasks, the reliance on generative models for task-oriented communication introduces new vulnerabilities. Through extensive experiments on several datasets, we analyze how bottleneck depth and task complexity influence adversarial robustness. Our key findings show that Shallow Variational Bottleneck Injection (SVBI) provides less adversarial robustness compared to Deep Variational Information Bottleneck (DVIB) approaches, with the gap widening for more complex tasks. Additionally, we reveal that IB-based objectives exhibit stronger robustness against attacks focusing on salient pixels with high intensity compared to those perturbing many pixels with lower intensity. Lastly, we demonstrate that task-oriented communication systems that rely on generative models to extract and recover salient information have an increased attack surface. The results highlight important security considerations for next-generation communication systems that leverage neural networks for goal-oriented compression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ICE-TIDE, a method for cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) that simultaneously aligns observations and reconstructs a high-resolution volume. The alignment of tilt series in cryo-ET is a major problem limiting the resolution of reconstructions. ICE-TIDE relies on an efficient coordinate-based implicit neural representation of the volume which enables it to directly parameterize deformations and align the projections. Furthermore, the implicit network acts as an effective regularizer, allowing for high-quality reconstruction at low signal-to-noise ratios as well as partially restoring the missing wedge information. We compare the performance of ICE-TIDE to existing approaches on realistic simulated volumes where the significant gains in resolution and accuracy of recovering deformations can be precisely evaluated. Finally, we demonstrate ICE-TIDE's ability to perform on experimental data sets.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Low-Dose CT Image Reconstruction by Domain and Task Shifting Gaussian Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computed tomography from a low radiation dose (LDCT) is challenging due to high noise in the projection data. Popular approaches for LDCT image reconstruction are two-stage methods, typically consisting of the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm followed by a neural network for LDCT image enhancement. Two-stage methods are attractive for their simplicity and potential for computational efficiency, typically requiring only a single FBP and a neural network forward pass for inference. However, the best reconstruction quality is currently achieved by unrolled iterative methods (Learned Primal-Dual and ItNet), which are more complex and thus have a higher computational cost for training and inference. We propose a method combining the simplicity and efficiency of two-stage methods with state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Our strategy utilizes a neural network pretrained for Gaussian noise removal from natural grayscale images, fine-tuned for LDCT image enhancement. We call this method FBP-DTSGD (Domain and Task Shifted Gaussian Denoisers) as the fine-tuning is a task shift from Gaussian denoising to enhancing LDCT images and a domain shift from natural grayscale to LDCT images. An ablation study with three different pretrained Gaussian denoisers indicates that the performance of FBP-DTSGD does not depend on a specific denoising architecture, suggesting future advancements in Gaussian denoising could benefit the method. The study also shows that pretraining on natural images enhances LDCT reconstruction quality, especially with limited training data. Notably, pretraining involves no additional cost, as existing pretrained models are used. The proposed method currently holds the top mean position in the LoDoPaB-CT challenge.</description>

      <title>Interpretability analysis on a pathology foundation model reveals biologically relevant embeddings across modalities</title>

Abstract: Pathology plays an important role in disease diagnosis, treatment decision-making and drug development. Previous works on interpretability for machine learning models on pathology images have revolved around methods such as attention value visualization and deriving human-interpretable features from model heatmaps. Mechanistic interpretability is an emerging area of model interpretability that focuses on reverse-engineering neural networks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising direction in terms of extracting monosemantic features from polysemantic model activations. In this work, we trained a Sparse Autoencoder on the embeddings of a pathology pretrained foundation model. We found that Sparse Autoencoder features represent interpretable and monosemantic biological concepts. In particular, individual SAE dimensions showed strong correlations with cell type counts such as plasma cells and lymphocytes. These biological representations were unique to the pathology pretrained model and were not found in a self-supervised model pretrained on natural images. We demonstrated that such biologically-grounded monosemantic representations evolved across the model's depth, and the pathology foundation model eventually gained robustness to non-biological factors such as scanner type. The emergence of biologically relevant SAE features was generalizable to an out-of-domain dataset. Our work paved the way for further exploration around interpretable feature dimensions and their utility for medical and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Perception-based multiplicative noise removal using SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplicative noise, also known as speckle or pepper noise, commonly affects images produced by synthetic aperture radar (SAR), lasers, or optical lenses. Unlike additive noise, which typically arises from thermal processes or external factors, multiplicative noise is inherent to the system, originating from the fluctuation in diffuse reflections. These fluctuations result in multiple copies of the same signal with varying magnitudes being combined. Consequently, despeckling, or removing multiplicative noise, necessitates different techniques compared to those used for additive noise removal.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach using Stochastic Differential Equations based diffusion models to address multiplicative noise. We demonstrate that multiplicative noise can be effectively modeled as a Geometric Brownian Motion process in the logarithmic domain. Utilizing the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive the corresponding reverse process for image denoising. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on two different datasets, comparing our approach to both classical signal processing techniques and contemporary CNN-based noise removal models. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on perception-based metrics such as FID and LPIPS, while maintaining competitive performance on traditional metrics like PSNR and SSIM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iodinated contrast agents are widely utilized in numerous interventional procedures, yet posing substantial health risks to patients. This paper presents CAS-GAN, a novel GAN framework that serves as a "virtual contrast agent" to synthesize X-ray angiographies via disentanglement representation learning and vessel semantic guidance, thereby reducing the reliance on iodinated contrast agents during interventional procedures. Specifically, our approach disentangles X-ray angiographies into background and vessel components, leveraging medical prior knowledge. A specialized predictor then learns to map the interrelationships between these components. Additionally, a vessel semantic-guided generator and a corresponding loss function are introduced to enhance the visual fidelity of generated images. Experimental results on the XCAD dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our CAS-GAN, achieving a FID of 5.87 and a MMD of 0.016. These promising results highlight CAS-GAN's potential for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Feature-Based Subtyping and Model Ensemble for Enhanced Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Accurate and automatic segmentation of brain tumors in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is essential for quantitative measurements, which play an increasingly important role in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. The International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2024 offers a unique benchmarking opportunity, including various types of brain tumors in both adult and pediatric populations, such as pediatric brain tumors (PED), meningiomas (MEN-RT) and brain metastases (MET), among others. Compared to previous editions, BraTS 2024 has implemented changes to substantially increase clinical relevance, such as refined tumor regions for evaluation. We propose a deep learning-based ensemble approach that integrates state-of-the-art segmentation models. Additionally, we introduce innovative, adaptive pre- and post-processing techniques that employ MRI-based radiomic analyses to differentiate tumor subtypes. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tumors present in the BraTS datasets, this approach enhances the precision and generalizability of segmentation models. On the final testing sets, our method achieved mean lesion-wise Dice similarity coefficients of 0.926, 0.801, and 0.688 for the whole tumor in PED, MEN-RT, and MET, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving segmentation performance and generalizability for various brain tumor types.

      <title>BSAFusion: A Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment Network for Unaligned Medical Image Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If unaligned multimodal medical images can be simultaneously aligned and fused using a single-stage approach within a unified processing framework, it will not only achieve mutual promotion of dual tasks but also help reduce the complexity of the model. However, the design of this model faces the challenge of incompatible requirements for feature fusion and alignment; specifically, feature alignment requires consistency among corresponding features, whereas feature fusion requires the features to be complementary to each other. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an unaligned medical image fusion method called Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment and Fusion (BSFA-F) strategy. To reduce the negative impact of modality differences on cross-modal feature matching, we incorporate the Modal Discrepancy-Free Feature Representation (MDF-FR) method into BSFA-F. MDF-FR utilizes a Modality Feature Representation Head (MFRH) to integrate the global information of the input image. By injecting the information contained in MFRH of the current image into other modality images, it effectively reduces the impact of modality differences on feature alignment while preserving the complementary information carried by different images. In terms of feature alignment, BSFA-F employs a bidirectional stepwise alignment deformation field prediction strategy based on the path independence of vector displacement between two points. This strategy solves the problem of large spans and inaccurate deformation field prediction in single-step alignment. Finally, Multi-Modal Feature Fusion block achieves the fusion of aligned features. The experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Retinex-RAWMamba: Bridging Demosaicing and Denoising for Low-Light RAW Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement, particularly in cross-domain tasks such as mapping from the raw domain to the sRGB domain, remains a significant challenge. Many deep learning-based methods have been developed to address this issue and have shown promising results in recent years. However, single-stage methods, which attempt to unify the complex mapping across both domains, leading to limited denoising performance. In contrast, two-stage approaches typically decompose a raw image with color filter arrays (CFA) into a four-channel RGGB format before feeding it into a neural network. However, this strategy overlooks the critical role of demosaicing within the Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, leading to color distortions under varying lighting conditions, especially in low-light scenarios. To address these issues, we design a novel Mamba scanning mechanism, called RAWMamba, to effectively handle raw images with different CFAs. Furthermore, we present a Retinex Decomposition Module (RDM) grounded in Retinex prior, which decouples illumination from reflectance to facilitate more effective denoising and automatic non-linear exposure correction. By bridging demosaicing and denoising, better raw image enhancement is achieved. Experimental evaluations conducted on public datasets SID and MCR demonstrate that our proposed RAWMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain mapping.</description>

Abstract: As human eyes serve as conduits of rich information, unveiling emotions, intentions, and even aspects of an individual's health and overall well-being, gaze tracking also enables various human-computer interaction applications, as well as insights in psychological and medical research. However, existing gaze tracking solutions fall short at handling free user movement, and also require laborious user effort in system calibration. We introduce Tri-Cam, a practical deep learning-based gaze tracking system using three affordable RGB webcams. It features a split network structure for efficient training, as well as designated network designs to handle the separated gaze tracking tasks. Tri-Cam is also equipped with an implicit calibration module, which makes use of mouse click opportunities to reduce calibration overhead on the user's end. We evaluate Tri-Cam against Tobii, the state-of-the-art commercial eye tracker, achieving comparable accuracy, while supporting a wider free movement area. In conclusion, Tri-Cam provides a user-friendly, affordable, and robust gaze tracking solution that could practically enable various applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inhomogeneous wave equations for the scalar, vector, and Hertz potentials are derived starting from retarded charge, current, and polarization densities and then solved in the reciprocal (or k-) space to obtain general solutions, which are formulated as nested integrals of such densities over the source volume, k-space, and time. The solutions thus obtained are inherently free of spatial singularities and do not require introduction by fiat of combinations of advanced and retarded terms as done previously to cure such singularities for the point-charge model. Physical implications of these general solutions are discussed in the context of specific examples involving either the real or reciprocal space forms of the different potentials. The present approach allows for k-space expansions of the potentials for arbitrary distributions of charges and may lead to applications in condensed matter and fluorescence-based imaging.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Multi-step Loss for Single Image Reflection Removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image reflection removal is crucial for restoring image quality. Distorted images can negatively impact tasks like object detection and image segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel approach for image reflection removal using a single image. Instead of focusing on model architecture, we introduce a new training technique that can be generalized to image-to-image problems, with input and output being similar in nature. This technique is embodied in our multi-step loss mechanism, which has proven effective in the reflection removal task. Additionally, we address the scarcity of reflection removal training data by synthesizing a high-quality, non-linear synthetic dataset called RefGAN using Pix2Pix GAN. This dataset significantly enhances the model's ability to learn better patterns for reflection removal. We also utilize a ranged depth map, extracted from the depth estimation of the ambient image, as an auxiliary feature, leveraging its property of lacking depth estimations for reflections. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on the SIR^2 benchmark and other real-world datasets, proving its effectiveness by outperforming other state-of-the-art models.</description>
