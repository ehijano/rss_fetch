      <title>A 5T-2MTJ STT-assisted Spin Orbit Torque based Ternary Content Addressable Memory for Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel non-volatile spin transfer torque (STT) assisted spin-orbit torque (SOT) based ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) with 5 transistors and 2 magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We perform a comprehensive study of the proposed design from the device-level to application-level. At the device-level, various write characteristics such as write error rate, time, and current have been obtained using micromagnetic simulations. The array-level search and write performance have been evaluated based on SPICE circuit simulations with layout extracted parasitics for bitcells while also accounting for the impact of interconnect parasitics at the 7nm technology node. A search error rate of 3.9x10^-11 is projected for exact search while accounting for various sources of variation in the design. In addition, the resolution of the search operation is quantified under various scenarios to understand the achievable quality of the approximate search operations. Application-level performance and accuracy of the proposed design have been evaluated and benchmarked against other state-of-the-art CAM designs in the context of a CAM-based recommendation system.</description>

      <title>On the Vulnerability of Applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation within Knowledge-Intensive Application Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been empirically shown to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal contexts. Given a query, RAG retrieves relevant documents from a corpus and integrates them into the LLMs' generation process. In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of RAG, focusing specifically on examining the retrieval system. First, across 225 different setup combinations of corpus, retriever, query, and targeted information, we show that retrieval systems are vulnerable to universal poisoning attacks in medical Q\&amp;A. In such attacks, adversaries generate poisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as personally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted into a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as attacker-specified queries are used. To understand this vulnerability, we discovered that the deviation from the query's embedding to that of the poisoned document tends to follow a pattern in which the high similarity between the poisoned document and the query is retained, thereby enabling precise retrieval. Based on these findings, we develop a new detection-based defense to ensure the safe use of RAG. Through extensive experiments spanning various Q\&amp;A domains, we observed that our proposed method consistently achieves excellent detection rates in nearly all cases.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum-Classical AI-Based Detection Strategy for Generative Adversarial Network-Based Deepfake Attacks on an Autonomous Vehicle Traffic Sign Classification System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perception module in autonomous vehicles (AVs) relies heavily on deep learning-based models to detect and identify various objects in their surrounding environment. An AV traffic sign classification system is integral to this module, which helps AVs recognize roadway traffic signs. However, adversarial attacks, in which an attacker modifies or alters the image captured for traffic sign recognition, could lead an AV to misrecognize the traffic signs and cause hazardous consequences. Deepfake presents itself as a promising technology to be used for such adversarial attacks, in which a deepfake traffic sign would replace a real-world traffic sign image before the image is fed to the AV traffic sign classification system. In this study, the authors present how a generative adversarial network-based deepfake attack can be crafted to fool the AV traffic sign classification systems. The authors developed a deepfake traffic sign image detection strategy leveraging hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (NNs). This hybrid approach utilizes amplitude encoding to represent the features of an input traffic sign image using quantum states, which substantially reduces the memory requirement compared to its classical counterparts. The authors evaluated this hybrid deepfake detection approach along with several baseline classical convolutional NNs on real-world and deepfake traffic sign images. The results indicate that the hybrid quantum-classical NNs for deepfake detection could achieve similar or higher performance than the baseline classical convolutional NNs in most cases while requiring less than one-third of the memory required by the shallowest classical convolutional NN considered in this study.</description>

      <title>VVTEAM: A Compact Behavioral Model for Volatile Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volatile memristors have recently gained popularity as promising devices for neuromorphic circuits, capable of mimicking the leaky function of neurons and offering advantages over capacitor-based circuits in terms of power dissipation and area. Additionally, volatile memristors are useful as selector devices and for hardware security circuits such as physical unclonable functions. To facilitate the design and simulation of circuits, a compact behavioral model is essential. This paper proposes V-VTEAM, a compact, simple, general, and flexible behavioral model for volatile memristors, inspired by the VTEAM nonvolatile memristor model and developed in MATLAB. The validity of the model is demonstrated by fitting it to an ion drift/diffusion-based Ag/SiOx/C/W volatile memristor, achieving a relative root mean error square of 4.5%.</description>

      <title>PhantomLiDAR: Cross-modality Signal Injection Attacks against LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a pivotal sensor for autonomous driving, offering precise 3D spatial information. Previous signal attacks against LiDAR systems mainly exploit laser signals. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of cross-modality signal injection attacks, i.e., injecting intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) to manipulate LiDAR output. Our insight is that the internal modules of a LiDAR, i.e., the laser receiving circuit, the monitoring sensors, and the beam-steering modules, even with strict electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, can still couple with the IEMI attack signals and result in the malfunction of LiDAR systems. Based on the above attack surfaces, we propose the PhantomLiDAR attack, which manipulates LiDAR output in terms of Points Interference, Points Injection, Points Removal, and even LiDAR Power-Off. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of PhantomLiDAR with both simulated and real-world experiments on five COTS LiDAR systems. We also conduct feasibility experiments in real-world moving scenarios. We provide potential defense measures that can be implemented at both the sensor level and the vehicle system level to mitigate the risks associated with IEMI attacks.

      <title>Modular Autonomous Vehicle in Heterogeneous Traffic Flow: Modeling, Simulation, and Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modular autonomous vehicles (MAVs) represent a groundbreaking concept that integrates modularity into the ongoing development of autonomous vehicles. This innovative design introduces unique features to traffic flow, allowing multiple modules to seamlessly join together and operate collectively. To understand the traffic flow characteristics involving these vehicles and their collective operations, this study established a modeling framework specifically designed to simulate their behavior within traffic flow. The mixed traffic flow, incorporating arbitrarily formed trains of various modular sizes, is modeled and studied. Simulations are conducted under varying levels of traffic demand and penetration rates to examine the traffic flow dynamics in the presence of these vehicles and their operations. The microscopic trajectories, MAV train compositions, and macroscopic fundamental diagrams of the mixed traffic flow are analyzed. The simulation findings indicate that integrating MAVs and their collective operations can substantially enhance capacity, with the extent of improvement depending on the penetration rate in mixed traffic flow. Notably, the capacity nearly doubles when the penetration rate exceeds 75%. Furthermore, their presence significantly influences and regulates the free-flow speed of the mixed traffic. Particularly, when variations in operational speed limits exist between the MAVs and the background traffic, the mixed traffic adjusts to the operating velocity of these vehicles. This study provides insights into potential future traffic flow systems incorporating emerging MAV technologies.</description>

      <title>Ecosystem-Agnostic Standardization of Quantum Runtime Architecture: Accelerating Utility in Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault tolerance is a long-term objective driving many companies and research organizations to compete in making current, imperfect quantum computers useful - Quantum Utility (QU). It looks promising to achieve this by leveraging software optimization approaches primarily driven by AI techniques. This aggressive research covers all layers of Quantum Computing Optimization Middleware (QCOM) and requires execution on real quantum hardware (QH). Due to the nascent nature of the technology domain and the proprietary strategies of both large and small players, popular runtimes for executing quantum workloads lack flexibility in programming models, scheduling, and hardware access patterns, including queuing, which creates roadblocks for researchers and slows innovation. These problems are further exacerbated by emerging hybrid operating models that place Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) supercomputing and Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) at the heart of real-time computations across quantum and distributed resources. There is a need for a widely adopted runtime platform (RP) driven by the open-source community that can be easily deployed to work in a distributed manner between Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), GPU, control hardware, external compute resources and provide required flexibility in terms of programming &amp; configuration models.</description>

      <title>Next-Gen Software Engineering: AI-Assisted Big Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of model-driven software engineering (MDSE) has been demonstrated in the context of complex software; however, it has not been widely adopted due to the requisite efforts associated with model development and maintenance, as well as the specific modelling competencies required for MDSE. Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly machine learning (ML) methods, have demonstrated considerable abilities when applied to the huge code bases accessible on open-source coding platforms. The so-called big code provides the basis for significant advances in empirical software engineering, as well as in the automation of coding processes and improvements in software quality with the use of AI. The objective of this paper is to facilitate a synthesis between these two significant domains of software engineering (SE), namely models and AI in SE. The paper provides an overview of the current status of AI-assisted software engineering. In light of the aforementioned considerations, a vision of AI-assisted Big Models in SE is put forth, with the aim of capitalising on the advantages inherent to both approaches in the context of software development. Finally, the new paradigm of pair modelling in MDSE is proposed.</description>
