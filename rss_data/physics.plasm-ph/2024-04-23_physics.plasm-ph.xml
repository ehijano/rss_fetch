      <title>Self-interaction of turbulent eddies in tokamaks with low magnetic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using local nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, we demonstrate that turbulent eddies can extend along magnetic field lines for hundreds of poloidal turns in tokamaks with weak or zero magnetic shear $\hat{s}$. We observe that this parallel eddy length scales inversely with magnetic shear and at $\hat{s}=0$ is limited by the thermal speed of electrons $v_{th,e}$. We examine the consequences of these "ultra long" eddies on turbulent transport, in particular, how field line topology mediates strong parallel self-interaction. Our investigation reveals that, through this process, field line topology can strongly affect transport. It can cause transitions between different turbulent instabilities and in some cases triple the logarithmic gradient needed to drive a given amount of heat flux. We also identify a novel "eddy squeezing" effect, which reduces the perpendicular size of eddies and their ability to transport energy, thus representing a novel approach to improve confinement. Finally, we investigate the triggering mechanism of Internal Transport Barriers (ITBs) using low magnetic shear simulations, shedding light on why ITBs are often easier to trigger where the safety factor has a low-order rational value.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Shielding Cloud Under Oscillatory External Forcing in Strongly Coupled Ultracold Neutral Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of crystalline clusters observed in Molecular Dynamics (MD) studies conducted earlier [Yadav, M., et al. Physical Review E, 107(5), 055214(2023)] for ultra-cold neutral plasmas. An external oscillatory forcing is applied for this purpose and the evolution is tracked with the help of MD simulations using the open source LAMMPS software. Interesting observations relating to cluster dynamics are presented. The formation of a pentagonal arrangement of particles is also reported.</description>

      <title>First numerical analysis of runaway electron generation in tungsten-rich plasmas towards ITER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disruption and runaway electron analysis model code was extended to include tungsten impurities in disruption simulations with the aim of studying the runaway electron (RE) generation. This study investigates RE current sensitivity on the following plasma parameters and modelling choices: tungsten concentration, magnetic perturbation strength, electron modelling, thermal quench time and tokamak geometry: ITER-like or ASDEX-like. Our investigation shows that a tungsten concentration below 10-3 does not cause significant RE generation on its own. However, at higher concentrations it is possible to reach a very high RE current. Out of the two tested models of electrons in plasma: fluid and isotropic (kinetic), results from the fluid model are more conservative, which is useful when it comes to safety analysis. However, these results are overly pessimistic when compared to the isotropic model, which is based on a more reliable approach. Our results also show that the hot-tail RE generation mechanism is dominant as a primary source of RE in tungsten induced disruptions, usually providing orders of magnitude higher RE seed than Dreicer generation. We discuss best practices for simulations with tungsten-rich plasma, present the dependence of the safety limits on modelling choices and highlight the biggest shortcoming of the current simulation techniques. The obtained results pave the way for a wider analysis of tungsten impact on the disruption dynamics, including the mitigation techniques for ITER in the case of strong contamination of the plasma with tungsten.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of Conventional and Ultrafast Spectroscopy Data for Investigating Detachment in the MAST-Upgrade Super-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the application, testing and first results of a new adaptive Bayesian inference analysis which utilises conventional and ultrafast spectroscopic measurements made in the divertor chamber to investigate the divertor physics during detachment. Validation of this software is performed prior and during analyses of results, demonstrated by compelling reproductions of ideal test cases and synthetic spectroscopic measurements. Application on real diagnostic data shows strong agreement with results from previous analysis methods. We identify unprecedented success in significant advances in time and computational efficiencies. We demonstrate a $\lesssim$1000$\times$ reduction in analysis time for spectroscopic measurements from simulated and real Super-X configurations, with the analysis technique presented in this report completing in &lt;3 minutes. Analysis of synthetic and real diagnostic measurements identifies detachment physics in agreement with previous literature.</description>

      <title>(Sub-)picosecond surface correlations of femtosecond laser excited Al-coated multilayers observed by grazing-incidence x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond high-intensity laser pulses at intensities surpassing $10^{14} \,\text{W}/\text{cm}^2$ can generate a diverse range of functional surface nanostructures. Achieving precise control over the production of these functional structures necessitates a thorough understanding of the surface morphology dynamics with nanometer-scale spatial resolution and picosecond-scale temporal resolution. In this study, we show that individual XFEL pulses can elucidate structural changes on surfaces induced by laser-generated plasmas, employing grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS). Using aluminum-coated multilayer samples we can differentiate between ultrafast surface morphology dynamics and subsequent subsurface density dynamics, achieving nanometer-depth sensitivity and subpicosecond temporal resolution. The observed subsurface density dynamics serve to validate advanced simulation models depicting matter under extreme conditions. Our findings promise to unveil novel avenues for laser material nanoprocessing and high-energy-density science.</description>

      <title>Frequency Dispersed Ion Acoustic Waves in the Near Sun Solar Wind: Signatures of Impulsive Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reports a novel plasma wave observation in the near-Sun solar wind: frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves. Similar waves were previously reported in association with interplanetary shocks or planetary bow shocks, but the waves reported here occur throughout the solar wind sunward of $\sim 60$ solar radii, far from any identified shocks. The waves reported here vary their central frequency by factors of 3 to 10 over tens of milliseconds, with frequencies that chirp up or down in time. Using a semi-automated identification algorithm, thousands of wave instances are recorded during each near-Sun orbit of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft. Wave statistical properties are determined and used to estimate their plasma frame frequency and the energies of protons most likely to be resonant with these waves. Proton velocity distribution functions are explored for one wave interval, and proton enhancements that may be consistent with proton beams are observed. A conclusion from this analysis is that properties of the observed frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves are consistent with driving by cold, impulsively accelerated proton beams near the ambient proton thermal speed. Based on the large number of observed waves and their properties, it is likely that the impulsive proton beam acceleration mechanism generating these waves is active throughout the inner heliosphere. This may have implications for acceleration of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Lifetime-Limited Linewidth Measurements of the 3C and 3D Soft X-ray Transitions in Ni XIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used the monochromatic soft X-ray beamline P04 at the synchrotron-radiation facility PETRA III to resonantly excite the strongest $2p-3d$ transitions in neon-like Ni XIX ions, $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{1/2}\,3d_{3/2}]_{J=1}$ and $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{3/2}\,3d_{5/2}]_{J=1}$, respectively dubbed 3C and 3D, achieving a resolving power of 15,000 and signal-to-background ratio of 30. We obtain their natural linewidths, with an accuracy of better than 10\%, as well as the oscillator-strength ratio $f(3C)/f(3D)$ = 2.51(11) from analysis of the resonant fluorescence spectra. These results agree with those of previous experiments, earlier predictions, and our own advanced calculations.</description>
