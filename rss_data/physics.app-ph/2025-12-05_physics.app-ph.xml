      <title>Theoretical analysis of frequency variation tolerance between elements of RTD-THz oscillator arrays for mutual locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Array configuration is one of the effective ways to increase the output power of terahertz oscillators using resonant tunneling diodes. Mutual locking between the array elements results in coherent single-spectrum oscillation and a narrow radiation beam. However, frequency variation between elements disturbs the mutual locking. In this paper, the frequency variation that can be tolerated for mutual locking is approximately derived for an array with arbitrary coupling configuration. Using this result, the element-number dependence of the frequency variation tolerance for 1D and 2D arrays is calculated. In 1D arrays, the frequency variation tolerance decreases inversely proportional to the square root of the element number. In 2D arrays, as the number of columns is increased while keeping the number of elements per column constant, the frequency variation tolerance increases for small number of columns, reaches a maximum at square configuration, and then decreases with increasing number of columns. The element-number dependence in 2D arrays is smaller than that in 1D arrays.</description>

      <title>Toward Enhanced Inertial Sensing via Dynamically Soft Topological States in Piezoelectric Microacoustic Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based gyroscopes have been employed to meet positioning and navigation demands of a plethora of commercially available devices. Most of such gyroscopes rely on electrostatic actuators with nanometer-scale air gaps$\unicode{x2013}$an architecture that enables large particle velocities in a proof mass and, consequently, high Coriolis-force sensitivity to angular velocity$\unicode{x2013}$but is inherently susceptible to damage under shock and vibration. This vulnerability is typically mitigated by purposely reducing gyroscopic sensitivity, thereby compromising readout accuracy. Microacoustic gyroscopes, by contrast, offer greater resilience to shock and vibration but currently exhibit significantly lower sensitivities. This limitation stems from the low dynamic compliance of the modes they employ$\unicode{x2013}$typically Lamb or Rayleigh modes$\unicode{x2013}$which restricts their maximum achievable particle velocity. This work presents a piezoelectric microacoustic device that overcomes this fundamental constraint by harnessing a topological interface state at the boundary between two microscale metamaterial structures. We theoretically and experimentally show that this state exhibits much higher modal compliance than Lamb or Rayleigh modes. This enables record-high particle velocities (&gt;51 m/s) never reached, due to material limits, by any previously demonstrated piezoelectric gyroscope.</description>

      <title>Metagrating-based Single-pixel Acoustic Direction Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials provide new opportunities for compact and efficient wavefront manipulation, extending beyond conventional bulky and power-intensive phased-arrays. In this work, we exploit the spatial encoding properties of the acoustic metagrating aperture to transform incident acoustic fields into compressed measurements for single-pixel acoustic source localisation. The proposed method enables accurate direction finding of acoustic sources over both 180 and 360 degrees angular ranges. Numerical simulations confirm the robustness of the metagrating-based compressive sensing approach against noise and limited sampling. Experimental validation is conducted to verify its feasibility with practical metagrating prototyes. Compared wiith tranditional array-based localisation techniques, the single-pixel metagrating system significantly reduces hardward complexity while maintaining high localisation accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating compressive sensing with acoustic metagratings for compact, low-cost, scalable source detection systems, with prospective applications in industrial monitoring, target tracking and non-destructive health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Biomimetic Liquid Metal Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium-based liquid metals, as a broad category of emerging functional materials with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties, offer numerous possibilities for advancing intelligent systems. However, a basic query persistently remains for the complex liquid metal system: Is there a minimal functional unit that can fully capture its diversity of morphology and function? Cells, as the most basic structural and functional units of life, are small in scale but have complex structures, functions, and life activities. Analogous to nature, this article proposes the concept of liquid metal cells, and systematically explores their construction routes, sensing capabilities, motion behaviors, and potential applications. We first construct a multi-phase composite structure with liquid metal as the nucleus, ionic solution as the cytoplasm, and polymer as the cell membrane by developing a layered cryogenic molding method. Furthermore, we reveal that liquid metal cells exhibit inherently versatile responsive characteristics and self-adaptive behaviors to thermal, pressure, chemical, electrical, and magnetic fields, indicating "small world, vast potential". Based on these fundamental findings, we finally demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing liquid metal cells as sensors, fluidic valves, and material transport carriers in flow channels through dynamic control.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Power-to-Heat-to-Power Storage Potential in Wind- and Solar-Dominated Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study assesses the role of Power-to-Heat-to-Power Storage (PHPS) systems, also known as Carnot batteries, in the national energy system of a wind-dominated (Denmark) and a solar-dominated (Spain) region. Using the open-source PyPSA framework, we model sector-coupled electricity and heating systems, and evaluate individual and district heating configurations for heat provision at residential level, with and without PHPS waste heat recovery. Our results show that PHPS is most viable in individual heating systems, and in wind-dominated locations, where its low cost per energy capacity enables it to balance long-duration fluctuations. Moreover, waste heat recovery is essential to enhance PHPS competitiveness, allowing it to displace lithium-ion batteries. Conversely, PHPS is largely outcompeted in district heating systems, which favour low-cost centralized energy storage. Sensitivity analysis highlights that PHPS viability depends primarily on achieving low energy capacity costs and maintaining reasonable heat-to-power conversion efficiencies. Overall, while PHPS complements existing storage technologies by providing dispatchable electricity and heat, its potential adoption is highly context-dependent, influenced by climate, heating system configuration, and competing storage costs.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Physical Mechanism behind Retention Loss in FeFETs with MIFIFIS Gate Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Metal-Gate Blocking Layer (GBL)- Ferroelectric-Tunnel Dielectric Layer (TDL)-Ferroelectric -Channel Insulator (Ch.IL)-Si (MIFIFIS) structure is proposed to achieve a larger MW for applications in Fe-NAND. However, the large retention loss (RL) in the MIFIFIS structure restricts its application. In this work, we vary the physical thickness of the GBL and TDL, and conduct an in-depth analysis of the energy bands of the gate structure to investigate the physical mechanism behind the RL in FeFETs with the MIFIFIS structure. The physical origin of the RL is that the electric field direction across the TDL reduces the potential barrier provided by the ferroelectric near the silicon substrate. Based on the above physical mechanism, the RL can be reduced to 12% and 0.2% by redesigning the gate structure or reducing the pulse amplitude, respectively. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanism behind the RL in FeFETs with the MIFIFIS gate structure. It provides guidance for enhancing the reliability of FeFETs.</description>

      <title>Debt, Growth, and the Carbon Lock-In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a macro-financial model that establishes a link between credit dynamics, economic growth, and cumulative carbon emissions. It is based on an extension of Kelly's model, a framework derived from information theory and investment theory, applied here to understand macro-financial and climate dynamics. This approach complements traditional Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) by explicitly linking financial dynamics to cumulative emissions, enabling the assessment of policy alignment (or misalignment) with net-zero pathways. We find that injecting debt into the system increases short-term production gains, but at the expense of higher bankruptcy risk and cumulative emissions. Thus, the model reveals a double constraint: financially, debt requires growth to be repaid; ecologically, growth requires energy, and therefore emissions. When the intrinsic growth rate falls below the interest rate, the probability of solvency drops to zero: the economy enters a zone of structural instability. The model then identifies an optimal leverage frontier: beyond a certain threshold, additional debt no longer fuels real wealth; it only increases the risk of bankruptcy and carbon debt. Our model is calibrated using multi-decade macroeconomic and emissions data from several countries, including the United States, China, France, and Denmark. Our results confirm that the correlation between cumulative debt, cumulative GDP, and cumulative emissions remains strong, regardless of the political structure of credit. In our current financial system, credit expansion amplifies GDP growth and associated emissions, thereby locking economies into higher cumulative carbon trajectories, even as energy efficiency improves through innovation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing solar cell efficiency of AlxIn1-xN/Si heterojunctions using an a-Si buffer: A study of material, interface and device properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of an optimized amorphous silicon (a-Si) buffer layer on AlxIn1-xN-on-Si(100) heterojunction solar cells, with Al content varying from 0% (InN) to 55%. The buffer layer improves the structural quality of the AlInN layer, as evidenced by reduced full width at half maximum values in X-ray diffraction rocking curves around the AlInN (0002) peak. Atomic force microscopy reveals that the buffer layer does not alter surface roughness. The effectiveness of the a-Si buffer is demonstrated by an enhancement of the conversion efficiency under AM1.5G illumination from 3.3 % to 3.9 % for devices with 35 % Al. Looking at the effect of the Al content in devices with the a-Si buffer, the device with 22% Al shows the best photovoltaic performance, with a conversion efficiency of 4.1 % and a VOC of 0.42 V, JSC of 15.4 mA/cm2, and FF of 63.3%. However, performance declines for Al contents above 36% due to increased resistivity and reduced carrier concentration. These findings highlight the critical role of the novel a-Si buffer layer developed by RF-sputtering and the Al content in optimizing AlInN/Si heterojunction solar cell performance.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Interconnects via Phase-Coherent Four-Wave Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum transduction, which enables the coherent conversion of quantum information between disparate physical platforms, is a cornerstone for realizing scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (&gt;99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-optimal nonlinear microscopy with classical light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical processes are used in biological microscopy to surpass the diffraction limit on resolution, image deeper into brain tissues, and identify biomolecules without exogenous labels. These techniques typically require high optical intensities to increase the strength of the nonlinear interactions, which can perturb native biochemistry and damage or kill living samples. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy visualizes the spatial distribution of molecules using a nonlinear interaction between light and chemically specific molecular vibrations. However, the detection of biomolecules at low concentrations is limited by the total photon dose that can be applied before photodamage alters the sample, and photon shot noise sets the minimum achievable noise floor for most microscopes. Here we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced SRS microscope that is more sensitive than an equivalent conventional SRS microscope by up to 8.3(7) dB in spectroscopy and 8.6(1) dB in cell imaging. These results approach quantum limits on sensitivity and demonstrate that quantum states of light are sufficient but not necessary to enhance the sensitivity of microscopy techniques that are limited by photodamage.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc as the holonomy of the Hopf fibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates a simple kinematical model of a disc (Disc B) rolling on the edge of a fixed disc (Disc A) to study the geometric nature of rotation. The total rotation angle $\Delta$ of Disc B after one cycle is decomposed into a dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and a geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The paper's main contribution is to demonstrate that this geometric phase can be essentially described as the $U(1)$ holonomy of the Hopf fibration with the canonical connection. By using a Gauss map to represent the disc's motion as a curve on a two-sphere ($S^2$), the work connects the physical rotation to the underlying geometry of the Hopf fiber bundle $S^3 \to S^2$ and clarifies the origin of the geometric phase.</description>

      <title>Persson's Theory of Purely Normal Elastic Rough Surface Contact: A Tutorial Based on Stochastic Process Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persson's theory of purely normal rough surface contact was developed two decades ago during the study of tire-road interaction, and gradually became one of the dominant approaches to study the solid-solid interaction between rough surfaces. Contrary to its popular applications in various cross-disciplinary fields, the fundamental study of Persson's theory of contact attracted little attention from the tribology and contact mechanics communities. As far as the authors know, many researchers struggle to understand the derivation of the theory. Few attempts have been made to clarify the oversimplified derivation provided by Persson (Persson, 2001). The present work provides a detailed tutorial on Persson's theory, which does not simply follow the commonly adopted derivation initiated by Persson. A new derivation is given based on stochastic process theory, assuming that the variation of the random contact pressure with respect to scale is a Markov process. We revisit the essential assumptions utilized to derive the diffusion equation, boundary conditions, drift and diffusion coefficients, and closed-form results. This tutorial can serve as a self-consistent introduction for solid mechanicians, tribologists, and postgraduate students who are not familiar with Persson's theory, or who struggle to understand it.</description>

      <title>Watt-level coherent microwave emission from dissipation engineered solid-state quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed metastability-induced quantum batteries have shown particular promise for coherent microwave generation. However, achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries remains fundamentally challenging due to quantum correlations, aging, and self-discharging processes. For the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED)-based quantum batteries, a further trade-off arises between strong spin-photon coupling for energy storage and sufficient output coupling for power delivery. To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power. By optimizing three dissipation schemes, we improve work extraction efficiency of the quantum battery by over two orders of magnitude and achieve high power compression factors outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques, establishing dissipation engineering as a pathway toward room-temperature, high-power coherent microwave sources.</description>

Abstract: A rectenna (rectifying antenna) is usually applied to a microwave power transmission (MPT) system as a terminal, which receives microwave (MW) power and converts them into DC power. A 5.8 GHz aperture-coupled patch antenna array is developed with a gain of 19.5 dBi, which is a part of the rectenna. A novel Class-F rectifier with a series diode is proposed to achieve a high rectifying efficiency based on harmonic termination techniques. The input circuit of the proposed rectifier is taken into consideration to reach the Class-F condition, while mostly only the output circuit is involved in conventional Class-F designs. A low-pass filter based on defected ground structure is implemented, which not only blocks the harmonics produced in rectifying but also presents desired impedance at harmonics. The current and voltage waveforms on the diode are well enforced. The radiation feature of the rectifier is presented as well. It shows that an optimized cavity, which shields the parasite radiation, may achieve a 5% enhancement on the MW-to-DC conversion efficiency. A C-band rectifier based on HSMS-286 Schottky diode is fabricated and measured. A MPT simple demo system is constructed with the proposed rectifier and antenna. A measured maximum MW-to-DC conversion efficiency of 72% is achieved on the rectifier. The design method is extremely valuable in a high conversion efficiency rectenna design based on harmonic termination techniques.</description>

      <title>A CMOS+X Spiking Neuron With On-Chip Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: We present the design and numerical simulation of a spiking neuron capable of on-chip machine learning. Built within the CMOS+X framework, the spiking neuron consists of an NMOS transistor combined with a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). This NMOS+MTJ unit, when simulated in the industry-standard circuit simulation software LTspice, reproduces multiple functions of a biological neuron, including threshold spiking, latency, refractory periods, synaptic integration, inhibition, and adaptation. These behaviors arise from the intrinsic magnetization dynamics of the MTJ and do not require any additional control circuitry. By interconnecting the NMOS+MTJ neurons, we construct a model of an analog multilayer network that learns through spike-timing-dependent weight updates derived from a gradient-descent rule, with both training and inference modeled in the analog domain. The simulated CMOS+X network achieves reliable spike propagation and successful training on a nonlinear task, indicating a feasible path toward compact, low-power, in-memory neuromorphic hardware for edge applications.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound for inertial confinement fusion target wall thickness measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation -- bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>
