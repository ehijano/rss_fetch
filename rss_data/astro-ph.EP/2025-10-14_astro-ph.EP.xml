      <title>A complex structure of escaping helium spanning more than half the orbit of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121\,b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape of planets on short orbital periods, driven by the host star's irradiation, influences their evolution, composition, and atmospheric dynamics. Our main avenue to probe atmospheric escape is through the near-infrared metastable helium triplet, which has enabled mass loss rate measurements for tens of exoplanets. Among them, only a few studies show evidence for out-of-transit absorption, supporting the presence of a hydrodynamic outflow. However, none of these observations precisely identified the physical extent of the outflow, either due to non-continuous or short-duration observations. This limits our measurements of accurate mass loss rates. Here we present the first continuous, full-orbit helium phase curve monitoring of an exoplanet, the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b, obtained with JWST/NIRISS. It reveals helium absorption for nearly 60% of the orbit at &gt;3sigma significance. Our results show that WASP-121b sustains a strong outflow, separating into two tails trailing and leading the planet. The persistent absorption from these tails, together with their measured radial velocity shifts, suggests that they remain in a collisional fluid regime at large distances from the planet and display very different dynamics. The leading trail has a higher density and moves toward the star, whereas the trailing trail is being pushed away from the star, with the latter being blue-shifted due to stellar irradiation pressure. While qualitatively agreeing with theoretical expectations, the observed structure of helium is not self-consistently reproducible by current models, limiting constraints on the mass loss rate. Furthermore, we show that while ground-based observations of the helium triplet are essential to measure the outflow dynamics precisely, they ideally should be combined with continuous JWST phase curves to constrain the absolute level of helium absorption.</description>

      <title>The influence of tight binaries on proto-planetary disk masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems are a common site of planet formation, despite the destructive effects of the binary on the disk. While surveys of planet forming material have found diminished disk masses around medium separation ($\sim$10--100 au) binaries, less is known about tight ($&lt;$10 au) binaries, where a significant circumbinary disk may escape the disruptive dynamical effects of the binary. We survey over 100 spectroscopic binaries in the Orion A region with ALMA, detecting significant continuum emission among 21 of them with disk masses ranging from 1--100 M$_{\oplus}$. We find evidence of systematically lower disk masses among the binary sample when compared to single star surveys, which may reflect a diminished planet forming potential around tight binaries. The infrared excess fraction among the binary sample is comparable to single stars, although the tight binaries without significant ALMA emission display tentative evidence of weaker 3-5$\mu$m excesses. The depletion of cold dust is difficult to explain by clearing alone, and the role of additional mechanisms needs to be explored. It may be the result of the formation pathway for these objects, systematic differences in intrinsic properties (e.g., opacity) or a bias in how the sample was constructed.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Photometry for Deconfusion of Directly Imaged Multi-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planned and future missions, including the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will aim to directly image Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars in reflected light. Determining whether an exoplanet is in the habitable zone of its star may be difficult in multi-planet systems when the observer does not know in advance which point source detection corresponds to which planet. This "confusion" problem will be a concern for future missions due to the high occurrence rate of multi-planet systems, and will be exacerbated by lack of prior knowledge about planets' orbital parameters or characteristics, particularly for systems at high inclination with respect to the observer. This work addresses the confusion problem by developing a photometry model and new orbit ranking function to augment the "deconfuser" tool and account for phase variation exhibited by a planet throughout its orbit. We demonstrate the new ranking scheme on a subset of thirty highly confused simulated multi-planet systems among three inclination groupings (low, medium, and high). Results indicate that photometry improves differentiation of previously confused orbits in 7/10 of the low inclination cases, 6/10 of the medium inclination cases, and 6/10 of the high inclination cases. This improvement in handling highly confused systems emphasizes that photometry shows promise for supporting orbit discrimination and deconfusion of directly imaged multi-planet systems, and should be considered when fitting orbits to detections.</description>

      <title>TESS Discovers a Second System of Transiting Exocomets in the Extreme Debris Disk of RZ Psc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the TESS discovery of only the second system of transiting exocomets with a sufficient number of events to measure the size distribution in the RZ Psc system, enabling comparisons with the $\beta$ Pictoris and Solar System size distributions. Twenty-four transits with absorption depths (AD) of 1--20\% were observed across three TESS sectors of the 20-50 Myr K0V star, detected as part of our TESS survey of extreme debris disks identified by their IR excess. We discover that the ADs (and hence exocomet radii) follow a broken power-law cumulative frequency distribution not previously seen in extrasolar contexts but similar to that observed in Solar System Kuiper Belt Object sizes, with power-law slopes above and below the break of $\gamma_\mathrm{AD&gt;break}$=2.32$\pm$0.12 and $\gamma_\mathrm{AD&lt;break}$=0.11$\pm$0.04, respectively. We derive size distributions of 1--7~km from two independent lines of evidence. We use the RZ Psc exocomet rate to predict exocomet yields for the Early eVolution Explorer (EVE) NASA astrophysics Small Explorer (SMEX) mission concept to obtain simultaneous photometry of 10$^4$ young stars in NUV, optical, and NIR bands. Assuming occurrence rates scaled from RZ Psc, EVE would detect 590 exocomets from $\approx$70 young systems in the optical band, with $\approx$120 simultaneous 5$\sigma$ detections in all three bands. These data would enable grain sizes of 200--700~nm and graphite--olivine compositions of dozens of events to be distinguished at 2.5--3$\sigma$, as well as a 4$\sigma$ determination of the accuracy of the Herschel-derived M-debris disk fraction.</description>

      <title>A revision of the lifetime of submoons: tidal dynamics with the Euler-Lagrange equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submoons, moons orbiting other moons, may be exotic environments capable of hosting extraterrestrial life. We extend previous studies to revise the maximum lifetime of these objects due to planetary, lunar and sublunar tidal migration.
  Using the Euler-Lagrange equation with a tidal dissipation process as specified by the Constant Geometric Lag model, we derive and solve the governing equations numerically to map the semi-major axis parameter space for star-planet-moon-submoon systems in which the submoon could be massive enough to host life.
  We find that Earth could have hosted asteroid-sized submoons ($\sim10^{15}\mathrm{kg}$), whereas a submoon near the previously proposed upper limit ($\sim4.6\cdot10^{17}\mathrm{kg}$) would have driven the Moon $\sim30\%$ farther from Earth than its current orbit.
  A Warm Jupiter system like Kepler1625 has greater potential of hosting a massive submoon. We found that a submoon of around $10\%M_{\text{Luna}}$ could survive if Kepler1625b's hypothesized moon were $68\%$ farther away then what the best-fit model suggests ($67R_{\mathrm{p}}$ instead of $40R_{\mathrm{p}}$). Giant submoons of mass $1.8M_{\oplus}$ are stable in a Kepler1625-like system. In these cases, the moon orbit is wide ($&gt; 100R_{\mathrm{p}}$). Decreasing the submoon mass to a habitability prerequisite of $0.5M_{\oplus}$, likely needed for a stable atmosphere and plate tectonics, leads to a smaller total number of stable iterations relative to the $m_{sm}=1.8M_{\oplus}$ case.
  In fact, we identified a minimum number of stable iterations on intermediate submoon mass-scales of around $0.1M_{\oplus}$. This is likely due to an interplay between small tidal forces at small submoon masses and small Roche-Limits at very high submoon masses. If submoon formation pathways in Warm Jupiter systems prefer such intermediate mass-scales, habitable submoons could be a rare phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On the discovery of meteoritic mineral Zolenskyite; The artificial origin should not be overlooked</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently a new meteoritic mineral, Zolenskyite (Fe0.99Mn0.04Ca0.01Cr1.99S3.98), was discovered from the Indarch meteorite. Zolenskyite was structurally indexed as the monoclinic C2/m CrNb2Se4 - Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 12.84(1) {\AA}, b = 3.44(1) {\AA}, c = 5.94(1) {\AA} and \b{eta} = 117(1){\deg}. Zolenskyite was reported as high-pressure phase formed from Daubr\'eelite at high pressures and temperatures in highly shocked regions of the EH parent asteroid. Although this discovery provides valuable information about the origin of meteoritic mineral assemblages, the results and conclusions raise controversies with those reported in previous articles where the synthetic FeCr2S4 was described. In this review, an alternative analysis of the supplementary X-ray data from Zolenskyite was made and yields to the monoclinic I2/m Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 5.940 {\AA}, b = 3.440 {\AA}, c = 11.441 {\AA} and \b{eta} = 90.55{\deg}, in agreement with previous results in the literature and differ from those reported above. Regarding the genesis of Zolenskyite and according to solid-state laboratory synthesis, the transformation of cubic FeCr2S4 phase (ideal composition of Daubr\'eelite) to monoclinic FeCr2S4 (ideal composition of Zolenskyite) requires a process whose replication in Shock metamorphism stages is not well established and remains an open issue to address, together with another open issue related to the real composition of meteoritic minerals, with minor and trace metals, which is often overlooked when compared with synthetic ideal compositions. Whatever the results to be obtained by addressing the above open issues, they will shed more light on the genesis of Zolenskyite. In this context, it is worth to promote an open debate about the hypothesis of artificial origin.</description>

      <title>Survival of satellites during the migration of a Hot Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin and stability of extrasolar satellites orbiting close-in gas giants, focusing on whether these satellites can survive planetary migration within a protoplanetary disk. To address this question, we used Posidonius, an N-Body code with an integrated tidal model, which we expanded to account for the migration of a gas giant within a disk. Our simulations include tidal interactions between a $1M_\odot$ star and a $1M_{Jup}$ planet, as well as between the planet and its satellite, while neglecting tides raised by the star on the satellite. We adopt a standard equilibrium tide model for the satellite, planet, and star, and additionally explore the impact of dynamical tides in the convective regions of both the star and planet on satellite survival. We examine key parameters, including the initial satellite-planet distance, disk lifetime (proxy for the planet's final orbital distance), satellite mass, and satellite tidal dissipation. For simulations incorporating dynamical tides, we explore three different initial stellar rotation periods. We find that satellite survival is rare if the satellite has nonzero tidal dissipation. Survival is only possible for initial orbital distances of at least 0.6 times the Jupiter-Io separation and for planets orbiting beyond about 0.1 AU. Satellites that fail to survive are either 1) tidally disrupted, as they experience orbital decay and cross the Roche limit, or 2) dynamically disrupted, where eccentricity excitation drives their periastron within the Roche limit. Satellite survival is more likely for low tidal dissipation and higher satellite mass. Given that satellites around close-in planets appear unlikely to survive planetary migration, our findings suggest that if such satellites do exist, another process should be invoked. In that context, we also discuss the claim of the existence of a putative satellite around WASP-49 A b.</description>

      <title>On The Orbital Evolution of Multiple Wide Super-Jupiters: How Disk Migration and Dispersal Shape the Stability of The PDS 70 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging has revealed exoplanet systems hosting multiple wide-orbit Super-Jupiters, where planet-planet interactions can shape their long-term dynamical evolution. These strong perturbations may lead to orbital instability, raising questions about the long-term survival of such systems. Shortly after formation, planet-disk interactions can shepherd planets into mean-motion resonances, which may promote long-term stability as seen in HR 8799. However, early-stage processes such as disk photoevaporation and viscosity can influence these outcomes. The $\sim$5 Myr-old PDS 70 system offers a unique laboratory to investigate these processes: its two massive ($&gt;$4 $M_{Jup}$), wide-orbit ($&gt;$20 AU) giants are still embedded in their natal disk. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of the system, allowing the disk to disperse via photoevaporation. Once the disk dissipates, we continue to track the planets' orbital evolution over Gyr timescales using N-body simulations. We find that the system is likely to remain stable for $&gt;$ 1 Gyr. To assess the importance of disk-driven evolution, we compare these results with disk-free N-body simulations using orbital parameters constrained by orbit fits that include recent relative astrometry and radial velocities from the literature. In this case, we find that only $\lesssim 4\%$ of posterior is stable for 100 Myr, highlighting the importance of considering disk-driven evolution for long-term dynamics stability of exoplanetary systems. We also simulate two three-planet configurations including the proposed inner candidate "PDS 70 d", finding that a higher photoevaporation leads the system to become unstable in $&lt;$ 10 Myr.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Data Quality and Decay in Mega-Constellations: A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of mega-constellations, the need for accurate and publicly available information has become fundamental for satellite operators to guarantee the safety of spacecrafts and the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space environment. This study critically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of publicly available ephemeris data for a LEO mega-constellation - Starlink. The goal of this work is twofold: (i) compare and analyze the quality of the data against high-precision numerical propagation. (ii) Leverage Physics-Informed Machine Learning to extract relevant satellite quantities, such as non-conservative forces, during the decay process. By analyzing two months of real orbital data for approximately 1500 Starlink satellites, we identify discrepancies between high precision numerical algorithms and the published ephemerides, recognizing the use of simplified dynamics at fixed thresholds, planned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagations. Furthermore, we compare data obtained from multiple sources to track and analyze deorbiting satellites over the same period. Empirically, we extract the acceleration profile of satellites during deorbiting and provide insights relating to the effects of non-conservative forces during reentry. For non-deorbiting satellites, the position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was approximately 300 m, while for deorbiting satellites it increased to about 600 m. Through this in-depth analysis, we highlight potential limitations in publicly available data for accurate and robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA), and importantly, we propose a data-driven model of satellite decay in mega-constellations.</description>

      <title>Rings around irregular bodies I. Structure of the resonance mesh, applications to Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three ring systems have been discovered to date around small irregular objects of the solar system (Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar). For the three bodies, material is observed near the second-order 1/3 Spin-Orbit Resonance (SOR) with the central object, and in the case of Quaoar, a ring is also observed near the second-order resonance 5/7 SOR. This suggests that second-order SORs may play a central role in ring confinement. This paper aims at better understanding this role from a theoretical point of view. It also provides a basis to better interpret the results obtained from N-body simulations and presented in a companion paper. A Hamiltonian approach yields the topological structure of phase portraits for SORs of orders from one to five. Two cases of non-axisymmetric potentials are examined: a triaxial ellipsoid characterized by an elongation parameter C22 and a body with mass anomaly mu, a dimensionless parameter that measures the dipole component of the body's gravitational field. The estimated triaxial shape of Chariklo shows that its corotation points are marginally unstable, those of Haumea are largely unstable, while those of Quaoar are safely stable. The topologies of the phase portraits show that only first- (aka Lindblad) and second-order SORs can significantly perturb a dissipative collisional ring. We calculate the widths, the maximum eccentricities and excitation time scales associated with first- and second-order SORs, as a function of C22 and mu. Applications to Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar using mu ~ 0.001 show that the first- and second-order SORs caused by their triaxial shapes excite large (&gt;~ 0.1) orbital eccentricities on the particles, making the regions inside the 1/2 SOR inhospitable for rings. Conversely, the 1/3 and 5/7 SORs caused by mass anomalies excite moderate eccentricities (&lt;~ 0.01), and are thus a more favorable place for the presence of a ring.</description>

      <title>Reanalysis of the eclipses of LHS 1140 c: No evidence of an atmosphere and implications for the internal structure of the planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the reanalysis of three 15 micron JWST/MIRI secondary eclipses of LHS 1140 c, a warm super-Earth (R$_{\rm{p}}$ = 1.272 R$_{\oplus}$) in a 3.78-day orbit around an M4.5 dwarf. We present a novel method for data reduction that leverages spatial derivatives of the point-spread function and compare it to widely used aperture photometry. Both methods yield eclipse depth consistent within 1 sigma of the values reported in the literature. We measure an eclipse depth of 271$^{+31}_{-30}$ ppm corresponding to a brightness temperature of $T_B=595^{+33}_{-34}$ K, consistent with a bare rock. The secondary eclipse occurs 4.1$\pm$0.8 minutes before the circular-orbit predicted time. We explore the implications of our results on the internal structure of LHS 1140 c, the orbital architecture of the system and the possibility of future observations with JWST. We find a core-mass fraction (CMF) informed by the stellar abundances of refractory elements of 0.34$\pm$0.11, inflated compared to the CMF from radius and mass measurements, suggesting the possible presence of bulk volatiles in the interior.</description>

      <title>A Metal-Rich Atmosphere with a Super-Solar C/O Ratio for the Extreme Ultra-Hot Jupiter WASP-178b</title>

Abstract: The population of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) provide unique opportunities to probe the extreme formation and evolutionary pathways in exoplanets. Owing to their very high temperatures and inflated atmospheres, UHJs are among the most favorable targets for both transmission and emission spectroscopy, enabling detailed characterization of their atmospheric properties. Here, we present a reanalysis of the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectra of the extreme ultra-hot Jupiter (EUHJ) WASP-178b, aimed at precisely characterizing its atmospheric composition. Our approach combines data reduction using two independent pipelines, lightcurve modeling with robust detrending techniques, and rigorous atmospheric retrievals. We report statistically significant detections of CO (7.24 $\sigma$) and CO$_2$ (7.22 $\sigma$), along with marginal evidence for C$_2$H$_2$ (1.34 $\sigma$), but no clear evidence for H$_2$O, suggesting depletion. From these retrieved abundances, we constrain the C/O ratio to a precise super-solar value of 0.954$\pm$0.033, consistent with an emerging trend in other UHJs. We also infer a very high atmospheric metallicity for a Jupiter-sized gas giant$\unicode{x2014}$11.44$_{-6.94}^{+12.54}$ $\times$solar$\unicode{x2014}$indicating unique atmospheric evolutions. These findings provide a critical benchmark for an extreme exoplanet atmosphere, offering a testbed for developing next-generation atmospheric evolution models and enabling comparative population-level studies across the UHJ population.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG XYZ. A sub-Neptune suitable for atmospheric characterization in a multiplanet and mutually inclined system orbiting the bright K dwarf TOI-5789 (HIP 99452)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11490</link>

Abstract: Sub-Neptunes with planetary radii of $R_{p} \simeq 2-4 R_{\oplus}$ are the most common planets around solar-type stars in short-period ($P&lt;100$ d) orbits. It is still unclear, however, what their most likely composition is, that is whether they are predominantly gas dwarfs or water worlds. The sub-Neptunes orbiting bright host stars are very valuable because they are suitable for atmospheric characterization, which can break the well-known degeneracy in planet composition from the planet bulk density, when combined with a precise and accurate mass measurement. Here we report on the characterization of the sub-Neptune TOI-5789 c, which transits in front of the bright ($V=7.3$ mag and $K_{s}=5.35$ mag) and magnetically inactive K1V dwarf HIP 99452 every 12.93 days, thanks to TESS photometry and 141 high-precision radial velocities obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We find that its radius, mass, and bulk density are $R_{c}=2.86^{+0.18}_{-0.15} R_\oplus$, $M_{c}=5.00 \pm 0.50 M_\oplus$, and $\rho_{c}=1.16 \pm 0.23$ g cm$^{-3}$, and we show that TOI-5789 c is a promising target for atmospheric characterization with both JWST and, in the future, Ariel. By analyzing the HARPS-N radial velocities with different tools, we also detect three additional non-transiting planets, namely TOI-5789 b, d, and e, with orbital periods and minimum masses of $P_{b}=2.76$ d, $M_{b}\sin{i}=2.12 \pm 0.28 M_\oplus$, $P_{d}=29.6$ d, $M_{d}\sin{i}=4.29 \pm 0.68 M_\oplus$, and $P_{e}=63.0$ d, $M_{e}\sin{i}=11.61 \pm 0.97 M_\oplus$. The mutual orbital inclination between planets b and c must be higher than $\sim4$ deg, which points to a dynamically hot system. Nevertheless, from sensitivity studies based on both the HARPS-N and archival HIRES radial-velocity measurements, we can exclude that such high mutual inclinations are due to the perturbation by an outer gaseous giant planet.</description>

      <title>Characterizing planetary systems with SPIRou: questions about the magnetic cycle of 55 Cnc A and two new planets around B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the first exoplanet hosts discovered thirty years ago, the star 55 Cnc has been constantly observed ever since. It is now known to host at least five planets with orbital periods ranging from 17 hours to 15 years. It is also one of the most extreme metal rich stars in the neighbourhood and it has a low-mass secondary star. In this article, we present data obtained at the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope with the SPIRou spectropolarimeter on both components of the 55 Cnc stellar system. We revisit the long-period radial-velocity signals of 55 Cnc A, with a focus on the role of the magnetic cycle, and propose the existence of a sixth planet candidate, whose period falls close to that of the magnetic cycle, or half of it. The other massive outer planet has a revised period of 13.15 years and a minimum mass of 3.8 MJup. Although some uncertainty remains on these outer planets, the characterization of the four inner planets is very robust through the combination of many different data sets, and all signals are consistent in the nIR and optical domains. In addition, the magnetic topology of the solar-type primary component of the system is observed by SPIRou at the minimum of its activity cycle, characterized by an amplitude ten times smaller than observed during its maximum in 2017. For the low-mass component 55 Cnc B, we report the discovery of two exoplanets in the system, with a period of 6.799+-0.0014 and 33.75+-0.04 days and a minimum mass of 3.5+-0.8 and 5.3+-1.4 MEarth, respectively. The secondary magnetic field is very weak and the current data set does not allow its precise characterization, setting an upper limit of 10 G. The system 55 Cnc stands out as the sixth binary system with planetary systems around both components, and the first one with non equal-mass stellar components.</description>

      <title>MANGOS II: Five new giant planets orbiting low-mass stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets orbiting low-mass stars on short orbits present a conundrum, as in the most extreme cases their existence cannot be reconciled with current models of core accretion. Therefore, surveys dedicated to finding these rare planets have a key role to play by growing the sample to overcome small number statistics. In this work we present MANGOS, a programme dedicated to the search for giant objects (planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars) orbiting M dwarfs. We report on the discovery of five new giant planets (TOI-3288 Ab, TOI-4666 b, TOI-5007 b, TOI-5292 Ab, TOI-5916 b) first detected by TESS, and confirmed using ground-based photometry and spectroscopy. The five planets have radii in the range 0.99-1.12 $\mathrm{R_{Jup}}$, masses between 0.49--1.69~$\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$, and orbital periods between 1.43 and 2.91 days. We reveal that TOI-3288 and TOI-5292 are wide binaries, and in the case of TOI-5292 we are able to characterise both stellar components. We demonstrate that the planets presented are suitable for further characterisation of their obliquities and atmospheres. We detect a small but significant eccentricity for TOI-5007 b, although for this to be more robust, more observations are needed to fully sample the orbit. Finally, we reveal a correlation between stellar metallicity and planet bulk density for giant planets orbiting low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>TOI-3288 b and TOI-4666 b: two gas giants transiting low-mass stars characterised by NIRPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas giant planets orbiting low-mass stars are uncommon outcomes of planet formation. Increasing the sample of well-characterised giants around early M dwarfs will enable population-level studies of their properties, offering valuable insights into their formation and evolutionary histories. We aim to characterise giant exoplanets transiting M dwarfs identified by TESS. High-resolution spectroscopic data are obtained in the optical and nIR, combining HARPS and NIRPS. We derive RVs via the cross-correlation function and implement a novel post-processing procedure to further mitigate telluric contamination in the nIR. The resulting RVs are jointly fit with TESS and ground-based photometry to derive the orbital and physical parameters of the systems. We confirm two gas giants transiting the low-mass stars TOI-3288 A (K9V) and TOI-4666 (M2.5V). TOI-3288 A hosts a Hot Jupiter with a mass of $2.11\pm0.08~M_{\rm Jup}$ and a radius of $1.00 \pm 0.03~R_{\rm Jup}$, with an orbital period of 1.43 days ($T_{\rm eq} = 1059 \pm 20~{\rm K}$). TOI-4666 hosts a $0.70_{-0.06}^{+0.05}~M_{\rm Jup}$ warm Jupiter ($T_{\rm eq} = 713 \pm 14~{\rm K}$) with a radius of $1.11 \pm 0.04~R_{\rm Jup}$, and an orbital period of 2.91 days. We identify a decrease in planetary mass with spectral type, where late M dwarfs host less massive giant planets than early M dwarfs. More massive gas giants that deviate from this trend are preferentially hosted by more metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we find an increased binarity fraction among low-mass stars hosting gas giants, which may play a role in enhancing giant planet formation around low-mass stars. The observed population trends agree with theoretical expectations, where higher metallicity can compensate for lower disk masses, and wide binary systems may influence planet formation and migration through Kozai-Lidov cycles or disk instabilities.</description>

      <title>The survival of aromatic molecules in protoplanetary disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aromaticity is a common chemical functionalities in bioactive molecules. In interstellar and circumstellar environments benzene and other small aromatics are considered the precursor for more complex prebiotic molecules and they have shown to potentially have rich ice-phase photochemistry. The availability of small organic molecules in prebiotic networks depends on their photostability in astrophysical environments preceding planet formation, particularly during the protoplanetary disk stage, as the disk composition is linked to the chemical make-up of planets and planetesimals. We study the ultraviolet (UV) photodestruction (120-160 nm) of five aromatic molecules in undiluted ices and, for selected cases, in astrophysically relevant ice matrices (H2O, CO, CO2). For each ice, we measure the destruction cross sections as a function of photon exposure. In undiluted ices, aromatic molecules exhibit substantially lower photodestruction cross sections (sigma &lt; 10-19 cm2) than aliphatic hydrocarbons, including cyclohexane, (sigma = 2.8-4x10-18 cm2). Furthermore, neither substituent nature nor size affects the aromatic stability in pure ices, suggesting that the strong intermolecular interactions among aromatic molecules provide protection against VUV exposure, even with small to mid-sized ring substituents. In mixed ices, the photodestruction and reactivity of aromatic molecules (sigma = 2.5-6.1x10-18 cm2) increases by more than an order of magnitude, but are still lower than in the gas-phase. We attribute this to a weaker cage effect and matrix-specific interactions. We use the experimental photodestruction cross sections to estimate the lifetime of aromatic molecules in protoplanetary disks, denileating the disks regions in which aromatic photochemistry is expected to be the most active.</description>

      <title>Insights into Planet Formation from the Ages, Masses, and Elemental Abundances of Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How planetary systems form and evolve is a key question in astronomy. Revealing how host star properties, such as elemental abundances, age, and mass, differ from those of non-host stars, and how they correlate with planetary characteristics such as radius, provides new insights into the formation and evolutionary pathways of planetary systems. We determine precise ages for 18890 dwarfs and subgiants from the LAMOST-Kepler-Gaia sample with a mean age uncertainty of about 15 percent (median about 10 percent). Within the framework of Galactic chemical evolution, we find that about 86 percent of planet-hosting stars younger than 8 Gyr occupy the upper branch ([Fe/H] &gt; -0.2) of the characteristic V-shaped age-metallicity relation of the Galactic disk. Based on guiding radii (Rg), we further infer that about 19 percent of these young hosts likely originated in the inner disk and subsequently migrated to the solar neighborhood. Among stars older than 10 Gyr, host stars tend to be more metal-rich, with nearly 59 percent having [Fe/H] &gt; -0.2. This suggests that both young and old planet-hosting stars preferentially form in relatively metal-rich environments. However, for host stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.2, we find that their metallicities are on average lower by about 0.16 dex compared to non-host stars of similar age and mass, indicating that [Fe/H] is unlikely to be the dominant factor governing planet formation in metal-poor environments. We also identify a systematic depletion of volatile elements, especially carbon, in planet hosts. Moreover, host star [Fe/H] exhibits a weak correlation with planet radius, while [alpha/Fe] primarily support the formation of small planets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has generated diverse perspectives in astronomy, with ongoing discussions between proponents and skeptics motivating this review. We examine how neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data analytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities through encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential equations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond training data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in billions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and expensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain knowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding models toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods offer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural architectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data efficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network structure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based inference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian distributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level cosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale neural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning effective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance large-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. - Emerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation models learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for research automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical applications.</description>

      <title>Using chromatic covariance to correct for scintillation noise in ground-based spectrophotometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric scintillation is one of the largest sources of error in ground-based spectrophotometry, reducing the precision of astrophysical signals extracted from the time-series of bright objects to that of much fainter objects. Relative to the fundamental Poisson noise, scintillation is not effectively reduced by observing with larger telescopes, and alternative solutions are needed to maximize the spectrophotometric precision of large telescopes. If the chromatic covariance of the scintillation is known, it can be used to reduce the scintillation noise in spectrophotometry. This paper derives analytical solutions for the chromatic covariance of stellar scintillation on a large telescope for a given atmospheric turbulence profile, wind speed, wind direction, and airmass at optical/near-infrared wavelengths. To demonstrate how scintillation noise is isolated, scintillation-limited exoplanet transit spectroscopy is simulated. Then, a procedure is developed to remove scintillation noise and produce Poisson-noise limited light curves. The efficacy and limits of this technique will be tested with on sky observations of a new, high spectrophotometric precision, low resolution spectrograph.</description>

      <title>Variation of the disk thickness across ice bands: A method to determine ice abundances in highly inclined protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope provides unprecedented information to study ices in protoplanetary disks. However, the saturation of ice bands in highly inclined disks hinders the measurement of ice abundances using classical spectroscopy. This is unfortunate as the presence and more importantly abundance of ices plays a key role in, e.g., the evolution of dust (because it modifies the sticking properties) and the composition of planetesimals and exoplanetary atmospheres. To overcome this issue and quantify the ice abundance within disks, we introduce a new method based on measuring the changes in the apparent disk thickness as a function of wavelength, which is directly and quantitatively related to the grain opacity. Specifically, we expect i) that the increased opacity within ice bands should result in a thicker disk than in the adjacent continuum, and ii) the thickness variations to be proportional to the abundance of ice. We extracted the disk thickness in model images of edge-on disks containing different abundances of water ice, as well as in James Webb Space Telescope spectral imaging of four edge-on disks. For both models and observations, the disk thickness decreases toward longer wavelengths except across the positions of ice absorption features where the thickness is enhanced across the band. In the model images, we demonstrate that this effect increases with ice abundance without any hint of saturation. This definitely demonstrates the presence of the ice species within each disk and confirms our expectation that this method can be applied to estimate ice abundances. Thanks to this method, it will thus be possible to constrain the ice abundance in highly inclined disks with disks model fitting. Unlike spectroscopic analysis, this method is not subject to saturation and should therefore be more robust and applicable to all disks for which the two surfaces can be resolved.</description>

      <title>NGTS-EB-8: A double-lined eclipsing M+M binary discovered by citizen scientists</title>

Abstract: We report the identification and characterization of a new binary system composed of two near-equal mass M-dwarfs. The binary NGTS-EB-8 was identified as a planet candidate in data from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) by citizen scientists participating in the Planet Hunters NGTS project. High-resolution spectroscopic observations reveal the system to be a double-lined binary. By modeling the photometric and radial velocity observations, we determine an orbital period of 4.2 days and the masses and radii of both stars to be $M_A=0.250^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ M$_{\odot}$, $M_B=0.208^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ M$_{\odot}$, $R_A=0.255^{+0.004}_{-0.005}$ R$_{\odot}$, $R_B=0.233^{+0.006}_{-0.005}$ R$_{\odot}$. We detect Balmer line emission from at least one of the stars but no significant flare activity. We note that both components lie in the fully convective regime of low-mass stars ($&lt;0.35$ M$_{\odot}$), therefore can be a valuable test for stellar evolutionary models. We demonstrate that the photometric observations, speckle imaging and initial radial velocity measurements were unable to identify the true nature of this system and highlight that high-resolution spectroscopic observations are crucial in determining whether systems such as this are in fact binaries.</description>

      <title>Searching for Free-Floating Planets with TESS: Results from Sectors 61-65</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though free-floating planets (FFPs) may outpopulate their bound counterparts in the terrestrial-mass range, they remain one of the least explored exoplanet demographics. Due to their negligible electromagnetic emission at all wavelengths, the only observational technique able to detect these worlds is gravitational microlensing. Microlensing by terrestrial-mass FFPs induces rare, short-duration magnifications of background stars, requiring high-cadence, wide-field surveys to detect these events. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), though designed to detect close-bound exoplanets via transits, boasts a Full-Frame Image cadence as short as 200 seconds and has monitored hundreds of millions of stars, providing a unique dataset in which to search for rare short-duration transients. We have performed a preliminary search for FFP microlensing in 7.5 million light curves from TESS Sectors 61 - 65. We find one short-duration event with a light curve morphology consistent with expectations for a low-mass FFP, but in tension with the expected FFP abundance in this mass range. We consider possible false positive interpretations of this event such as stellar flares, hearbeat binaries, and centrifugal breakout. We find that all interpretations pose some challenges, and discuss the possibility that the event may constitute a first example of a new class of pernicious false positives that future space-based microlensing efforts will encounter. Our ongoing search through the TESS dataset will significantly support the upcoming hunt for rogue worlds with dedicated space-based microlensing surveys, and our results may be used alongside these surveys to place interesting constraints on the spatial distribution of FFPs in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The possibility of a giant impact on Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant impacts were common in the early evolution of the Solar System, and it is possible that Venus also experienced an impact. A giant impact on Venus could have affected its rotation rate and possibly its thermal evolution. In this work, we explore a range of possible impacts using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider the final major collision, assuming that differentiation already occurred and that Venus consists of an iron core (30% of Venus' mass) and a forsterite mantle (70% of Venus' mass). We use differentiated impactors with masses ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 Earth masses, impact velocities between 10 and 15 km/s, various impact geometries (head-on and oblique), different primordial thermal profiles, and a range of pre-impact rotation rates of Venus. We analyse the post-impact rotation periods and debris disc masses to identify scenarios that can reproduce Venus' present-day characteristics. Our findings show that a wide range of impact scenarios are consistent with Venus' current rotation. These include head-on collisions on a non-rotating Venus and oblique, hit-and-run impacts by Mars-sized bodies on a rotating Venus. Importantly, collisions that match Venus' present-day rotation rate typically produce minimal debris discs residing within Venus' synchronous orbit. This suggests that the material would likely reaccrete onto the planet, preventing the formation of long-lasting satellites - consistent with Venus' lack of a moon. We conclude that a giant impact can be consistent with both Venus' unusual rotation and lack of a moon, potentially setting the stage for its subsequent thermal evolution.</description>

      <title>High-resolution models of the vertical shear instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (abridged) Context: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to generate turbulence and transport angular momentum in protoplanetary discs. While most recent work has focused on adding more complex physics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended discs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely unknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence using radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so as to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent cascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to 200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi azimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1.
  Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged with 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3. Inner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational domain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation wave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence. Our models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices, in contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the turbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the framework of critically balanced rotating turbulence.
  Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs, associated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant long-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions of VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts affecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used in a more systematic manner.</description>

      <title>Investigating aerosols as a way to reconcile K2-18 b JWST MIRI and NIRISS/NIRSpec observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b with NIRISS SOSS/NIRSpec G395H and MIRI LRS have yielded apparently inconsistent results: the MIRI spectra exhibit spectral features nearly twice as large as those seen at shorter wavelengths, challenging the high-metallicity, CH4-rich non-equilibrium model that fits the NIRISS/NIRSpec data. We perform a suite of atmospheric retrievals on both datasets, including free-chemistry, non-equilibrium, and aerosol models, using laboratory-derived complex refractive indices for a variety of photochemical haze analogues. Free retrievals systematically return lower metallicities than inferred by self-consistent chemical disequilibrium models, and the inclusion of absorbing aerosols, especially CH4-dominated, nitrogen-poor tholins, can further reduce the inferred metallicity by over an order of magnitude. These hazes reproduce the observed NIRISS slope through scattering and match MIRI features via C-H bending absorption near 7 um, while yielding particle properties consistent with photochemical production in H2-rich atmospheres. Although their inclusion improves the joint fit and reduces tension between datasets, it also significantly lowers the retrieved CH4 abundance, highlighting degeneracies between metallicity, composition, and aerosol properties. Our results underscore the importance of aerosol absorption in interpreting temperate sub-Neptune spectra, and motivate future JWST observations and laboratory work to break these degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Far-Ultraviolet Emission Line Investigation of Flares on AU Mic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The role of non-thermal proton energy transportation during solar and stellar flares is largely unknown; a better understanding of this physical process will allow us to rectify longstanding deficiencies in flare models. One way to detect the presence of non-thermal protons during flares is through the Orrall-Zirker (OZ) effect, proposed by Orrall &amp; Zirker (1976), whereby an enhanced red wing appears in hydrogen emission lines (e.g., Lyman-$\alpha$ at 1215.67 angstroms). We analyze archival Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph G130M (1060 - 1360 angstroms) observations of the young M dwarf, AU Mic to search for evidence of OZ effect during the impulsive phase of six stellar flares with $E_\textrm{flare} \approx 10^{30 - 31}$ erg. While we found non-detections of the OZ effect, we note there is a pronounced blue enhancement in several C II and C III emission lines during one of the high-energy flares. We propose that either filament eruptions or chromospheric evaporation could be the mechanism driving this observed blue enhancement. We compare the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra to 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models, which are unable to reproduce the blue enhancement and broadening in these cool flare lines. By completing a line-by-line analysis of the FUV spectrum of AU Mic, we provide further constraints on the physical mechanisms producing stellar flares on M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Solar Flux Atlases: The new HARPS-N Quiet Sun Benchmark and Ca II H &amp; K Lines Continuum Normalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Solar flux atlases observe the spatially integrated light from the Sun, treating it as a star. They are fundamental tools for gaining insight into the composition of the Sun and other stars, and are utilized as reference material for a wide range of solar applications such as stellar chemical abundances, atmospheric physics, stellar activity, and radial velocity signals. Aims. We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the well-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured activity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work. Methods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas were selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent Widths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this work. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller activity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to the QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar activity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through simple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally, our investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca ii H &amp; K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused by assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases. Conclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited to serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the visible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our recommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the observations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...</description>
