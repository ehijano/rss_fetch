      <title>Ensemble score filter with image inpainting for data assimilation in tracking surface quasi-geostrophic dynamics with partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation plays a pivotal role in understanding and predicting turbulent systems within geoscience and weather forecasting, where data assimilation is used to address three fundamental challenges, i.e., high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, and partial observations. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based data assimilation methods have demonstrated encouraging results. In this work, we develop an ensemble score filter (EnSF) that integrates image inpainting to solve the data assimilation problems with partial observations. The EnSF method exploits an exclusively designed training-free diffusion models to solve high-dimensional nonlinear data assimilation problems. Its performance has been successfully demonstrated in the context of having full observations, i.e., all the state variables are directly or indirectly observed. However, because the EnSF does not use a covariance matrix to capture the dependence between the observed and unobserved state variables, it is nontrivial to extend the original EnSF method to the partial observation scenario. In this work, we incorporate various image inpainting techniques into the EnSF to predict the unobserved states during data assimilation. At each filtering step, we first use the diffusion model to estimate the observed states by integrating the likelihood information into the score function. Then, we use image inpainting methods to predict the unobserved state variables. We demonstrate the performance of the EnSF with inpainting by tracking the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) model dynamics under a variety of scenarios. The successful proof of concept paves the way to more in-depth investigations on exploiting modern image inpainting techniques to advance data assimilation methodology for practical geoscience and weather forecasting problems.</description>

      <title>Influence of initial conditions on data-driven model identification and information entropy for ideal mhd problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven methods of model identification are able to discern governing dynamics of a system from data. Such methods are well suited to help us learn about systems with unpredictable evolution or systems with ambiguous governing dynamics given our current understanding. Many plasma problems of interest fall into these categories as there are a wide range of models that exist, however each model is only useful in a certain regime and often limited by computational complexity. To ensure data-driven methods align with theory, they must be consistent and predictable when acting on data whose governing dynamics are known. Weak Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) is a recently developed data-driven method that has shown promise in learning governing dynamics from data with high noise levels [1]. This work examines how WSINDy acts on ideal MHD test problems as the initial conditions are varied and specifies limiting requirements for successful equation identification. It is hard to recover the governing dynamics from data that emphasize a single dominant behavior. In these low information cases, Shannon information entropy is able to pick up on the redundancies in the data that affect recoverability.</description>

      <title>Universal New Physics Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning method for mapping data originating from both Standard Model processes and various theories beyond the Standard Model into a unified representation (latent) space while conserving information about the relationship between the underlying theories. We apply our method to three examples of new physics at the LHC of increasing complexity, showing that models can be clustered according to their LHC phenomenology: different models are mapped to distinct regions in latent space, while indistinguishable models are mapped to the same region. This opens interesting new avenues on several fronts, such as model discrimination, selection of representative benchmark scenarios, and identifying gaps in the coverage of model space.</description>
