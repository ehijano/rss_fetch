      <title>Two-dimensional capillary liquid drop: Craig-Sulem formulation on $\mathbb{T}^1$ and bifurcations from multiple eigenvalues of rotating waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the free boundary problem for a two-dimensional, incompressible, perfect, irrotational liquid drop of nearly circular shape with capillarity: that is, we consider the 2D version of the 3D capillary drop problem treated in Baldi-Julin-La Manna [11] and Baldi-La Manna-La Scala [12]. In particular, we derive its Craig-Sulem formulation firstly over the circle, then over the one-dimensional flat torus; the arising equations are similar to the pure capillary Water Waves for the ocean problem, apart from conformal factors and additional terms due to curvature terms. Then, we show its Hamiltonian structure and we derive constants of motions from symmetries, one of which is the invariance by the torus action. Thanks to this invariance, we show the existence of orbits of rotating wave solutions (which are the analogous of travelling waves of the ocean problem) by bifurcation from multiple eigenvalues in the spirit of Moser-Weinstein [44, 56] and Craig-Nicholls [22] variational approaches; in particular, we can parametrize such orbits by the angular momentum, and for each value of it they are unique. This will imply that each orbit is generated by symmetric rotating waves.</description>

      <title>Relative Entropy Contractions for Extremal Shocks of Nonlinear Hyperbolic Systems without Genuine Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extremal shocks of $1$-d hyperbolic systems of conservation laws which fail to be genuinely nonlinear. More specifically, we consider either $1$- or $n$-shocks in characteristic fields which are either concave-convex or convex-concave in the sense of LeFloch. We show that the theory of $a$-contraction can be applied to obtain $L^2$-stability up to shift for these shocks in a class of weak solutions to the conservation law whose shocks obey the Lax entropy condition. Our results apply in particular to the $2 \times 2$ system of nonlinear elastodynamics.</description>

      <title>Existence and Multiplicity of Solutions for a Cooperative Elliptic System Using Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of nontrivial solutions of the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the following elliptic system: \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{aligned} -\Delta u &amp; = au + bv + f(x,u,v); &amp;\quad\mbox{ for }x\in\Omega,\\ -\Delta v &amp; = bu + cv + g(x,u,v), &amp;\quad\mbox{ for }x\in\Omega,\\ u&amp;=v=0,&amp;\quad\mbox{ on }\partial\Omega, \end{aligned} \right.\qquad (1) \end{equation} for $x\in\Omega$, where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is an open and connected bounded set with a smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$, with $N\geqslant 3,$ $u,v:\overline{\Omega}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R},$ and $f,g : \overline{\Omega} \times\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions with $f(x,0,0)=0$ and $g(x,0,0) = 0$, and with super-quadratic, but sub-critical growth in the last two variables. We prove that the boundary value problem (1) has at least two nontrivial solutions for the case in which the eigenvalues of the matrix $\displaystyle \textbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ b &amp; c \end{pmatrix}$ are higher than the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian over $\Omega$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions; $u = v= 0$ on $\partial\Omega$. We use variational methods and infinite-dimensional Morse theory to obtain the multiplicity result.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity results for non-local operators of elliptic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of problems proposed by Servadei and Valdinoci in \cite{Ser3}; namely, \begin{equation}\label{prob_0} \left\{\begin{aligned} -\mathcal{L}_{K} u(x)-\lambda u(x) &amp; =f(x,u), \mbox{ for } x\in \Omega; u &amp; =0 \quad \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{N}\backslash\Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation} where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ is an open bounded set with Lipschitz boundary, $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, $f\in C^{1}(\overline{\Omega}\times\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$, with $f(x,0) = 0$ for $x\in\Omega$, and $\mathcal{L}_K$ is a non-local integrodifferential operator with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. By computing the critical groups of the associated energy functional for problem (1) at the origin and at infinity, respectively, we prove that problem (\ref{prob_0}) has three nontrivial solutions for the case $\lambda &lt; \lambda_1$ and two nontrivial solutions for the case $\lambda\geqslant\lambda_1,$ where $\lambda_1$ is the first eigenvalue of the operator $-\mathcal{L}_K$. Finally, assuming that the nonlinearity $f$ is odd in the second variable, we prove the existence of an unbounded sequence of weak solutions of problem (1) for the case  $\lambda\geqslant\lambda_1$. We use variational methods and infinite-dimensional Morse theory to obtain the results.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions of semilinear wave equations with time-dependent propagation speed and time derivative nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider wave equations with time derivative nonlinearity and time-dependent propagation speed which are generalized versions of the wave equations in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime, the de Sitter spacetime and the anti-de Sitter space time. We show lower bounds of the lifespan of solutions as well as the global existence by providing an integrability condition on the propagation speed function, which is applicable to the nonlinear wave equation in the expanding FLRW spacetime including the de Sitter spacetime. We also prove that blow-up in a finite time occurs for the generalized form of the equation in contracting universes such as the anti-de Sitter spacetime, as well as upper bounds of the lifespan of blow-up solutions.</description>

      <title>Relations between different types of Hypoellipticity: A systematic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a systematic treatment to the concept of hypoellipticity, putting it into an abstract form which allows us to deal with several different notions within the same framework. We then investigate when a notion of hypoellipticity implies another one and, in particular, when it can be extended for more general spaces. We also present a relation between certain types of hypoellipticity and local solvability (for the transpose) for a family of operators.</description>

      <title>Nematic liquid crystals: Ericksen-Leslie theory with general stress tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ericksen-Leslie model for nematic liquid crystal flows in case of an isothermal and incompressible fluid with general Leslie stress and anisotropic elasticity, i.e. with general Ericksen stress tensor, is shown for the first time to be strongly well-posed. Of central importance is a fully nonlinear boundary condition for the director field, which, in this generality, is necessary to guarantee that the system fulfills physical principles. The system is shown to be locally, strongly well-posed in the $L_p$-setting. More precisely, the existence and uniqueness of a local, strong $L_p$-solution to the general system is proved and it is shown that the director $d$ satisfies $|d|_2\equiv 1$ provided this holds for its initial data $d_0$. In addition, the solution is shown to depend continuously on the data.
  The results are proven without any structural assumptions on the Leslie coefficients and in particular without assuming Parodi's relation.</description>

      <title>An Integration--Annihilator method for analytical solutions of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method to derive particular solutions for partial differential equations of the form $(\operatorname{A} + \operatorname{B})^k Q(x) = q(x)$, with $\operatorname{A}$ and $\operatorname{B}$ being linear differential operators with constant coefficients, $k$ an integer, and $Q$ and $q$ sufficiently smooth functions. The approach requires that a function $W$ and an integer $\lambda$ can be found with the following two conditions: $q$ can be integrated with respect to $\operatorname{A}$ such that $\operatorname{A}^{\lambda + k} W(x) = q(x)$, and $\operatorname{B}^{\lambda + 1}$ annihilates $W$ such that $\operatorname{B}^{\lambda + 1} W(x) = 0$.
  Applications include the Poisson equation $\Delta Q(x) = q(x)$, the inhomogeneous polyharmonic equation $\Delta^k Q(x) = q(x)$, the Helmholtz equation $(\Delta + \nu) Q(x) = q(x)$ and the wave equation $\Box Q(x) = q(x)$. We show how solving the Poisson equation allows to derive the Helmholtz decomposition that splits a sufficiently smooth vector field into a gradient field and a divergence-free rotation field.</description>

      <title>Classification of radial solutions of energy-critical wave systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns a general system of energy-critical wave equations in the Minkowski space of dimension $1+3$. The wave equations are coupled by the nonlinearities, which are homogeneous of degree 5.
  We prove that any radial solution of the system can be written asymptotically as a sum of rescaled stationary solutions plus a radiation term, along any sequence of times for which the solution is bounded in the energy space. With an additional structural assumption on the nonlinearity, we prove a continuous in time resolution result for radial solutions.
  The proof of the sequential resolution uses the channel of energy method, as in the scalar case treated by Duyckaerts, Kenig and Merle (Cambridge Journal of Mathematics 2013 and arXiv 1204.0031). The proof of the continous in time resolution is based on new compactness and localization arguments.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity for kinetic Fokker-Planck equations in domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the smoothness of solutions to linear kinetic Fokker-Planck equations in domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with specular reflection condition, including Kolmogorov's equation $\partial_t f +v\cdot\nabla_x f-\Delta_v f=h$. Our main results establish the following:
  - Solutions are always $C^\infty$ in $t,v,x$ away from the grazing set $\{x\in\partial\Omega,\ v\cdot n_x=0\}$.
  - They are $C^{4,1}_{\text{kin}}$ up to the grazing set.
  - This regularity is optimal, i.e. we show that that they are in general not $C^5_{\text{kin}}$.
  These results show for the first time that solutions are classical up to boundary, i.e. $C^1_{t,x}$ and $C^2_v$.</description>

      <title>Global strong well-posedness of the CAO-problem introduced by Lions, Temam and Wang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the CAO-problem introduced by Lions, Temam and Wang, which concerns a system of two fluids described by two primitive equations coupled by fully nonlinear interface conditions. They proved in their pioneering work the existence of a weak solution to the CAO-system; its uniqueness remained an open problem. In this article, it is shown that this coupled CAO-system is globally strongly well-posed for large data, even in critical Besov spaces. It is furthermore shown that, away from the boundary, the solution is even real analytic. The approach presented relies on an optimal data result for the boundary terms in the linearized system in terms of time-space Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. Boundary terms are then controlled by paraproduct methods in these spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study isentropic fluid flows of gases of the Forchheimer-type in heterogeneous porous media. The governing equation is a doubly nonlinear parabolic equation with coefficients depending on the spatial variables. Its solutions are subject to a nonlinear Robin boundary condition. We establish the estimates of the solutions for short time in terms of the initial and boundary data. For the proof, the multi-weight versions of the Sobolev inequality, parabolic Sobolev inequality and trace theorem are derived. They are then used to implement the Moser iteration for suitable weighted norms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the relativistic Landau equation in the spatially inhomogeneous, far-from-equilibrium regime. We establish regularity estimates of all orders, implying that solutions remain smooth for as long as some zeroth-order conditional bounds hold. We also prove that polynomial and exponential decay in the momentum variable is propagated forward in time.
  As part of our proof, we establish a Schauder estimate for linear relativistic kinetic equations, that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the defect structure of minimizer of a Landau-de Gennes energy functional in three-dimensional domains, subject to constraint $|Q|=1$. The set of defects is identified by discontinuities in both the eigenframe and the leading eigenvector. Through a blow-up analysis, we prove that the defect set is 1-rectifiable and classify the asymptotic profile of the leading eigenvector near singularities. This generalizes some previous results on the structure of ring disclinations in the $Q$-tensor model.</description>

      <title>Smooth supersonic spiral flows with nonzero vorticity to the steady Euler-Poisson system in a concentric cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the structural stability of smooth cylindrically symmetric supersonic spiral flows to the steady Euler-Poisson system in a concentric cylinder. We establish the existence and uniqueness of some smooth supersonic Euler-Poisson flows with nonzero angular velocity and vorticity including both cylindrical spiral flows and axisymmetric spiral flows. The deformation-curl-Poisson decomposition for the steady Euler-Poisson system is utilized to deal with the hyperbolic-elliptic mixed structure in the supersonic region. For smooth cylindrical supersonic spiral flows, the key point lies on the well-posedness of a boundary value problem for a linear second order hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system, which is achieved by finding an appropriate multiplier to obtain the important basic energy estimates. The nonlinear structural stability is established by designing a two-layer iteration and combining the estimates for the hyperbolic-elliptic system and the transport equations. For smooth axisymmetric supersonic spiral flows, we use the special structure of the steady Euler-Poisson system to derive a priori estimates of the linearized second order elliptic system, which enable us to establish the structural stability of the background supersonic flow within the class of axisymmetric flows.</description>

      <title>Filamentation near monotone zonal vortex caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Euler equations on a rotating unit sphere, focusing on the dynamics of vortex caps. Leveraging the $L^1$-stability of monotone, longitude-independent profiles, we demonstrate that certain ill-prepared initial data within the vortex cap class exhibit an instability characterized by the growth of the interface perimeter. These configurations are nearly equivalent in area to a zonal vortex cap but are perturbed by a localized latitudinal bump. By comparing the longitudinal flows at points along the zonal interface and within the bump region, we track the induced stretching and capture the underlying instability mechanism.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for a non-local integrable equation with applications to geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish global existence of higher-order Sobolev solutions for a non-local integrable evolution equation arising in the study of pseudospherical surfaces and non-linear wave propagation. Under a natural assumption on the initial momentum, we prove that the solution remains globally regular in arbitrary finite-order Sobolev spaces. The proof relies on an inductive energy method involving a hierarchy of functional estimates and applies uniformly to both the periodic and non-periodic settings.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and leapfrogging phenomena of multiple helical vortices for 3D incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the time evolution of multiple interacted helical vortices without swirl for the incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb R^3$. Assuming that the initial helical symmetric vorticity is concentrated within an $\ep$ neighborhood of $N$ distinct helices with vanishing mutual distance of order $O(\frac{1}{|\ln \ep|})$, and each vortex core possesses a vorticity mass of order $O(\frac{1}{|\ln \ep|^2})$, we show that as $\ep\to 0$, the motion of the helical vortices converges to a dynamical system for positive times. Notably, in the case of two interacting helical vortices with initial mutual separation $ \frac{\rho_0}{|\ln \ep|}$, by selecting sufficiently small $\rho_0$, our analysis extends to longer timescales encompassing several periods. This result provides the first mathematical justification for the phenomena in numerical observation termed "leapfrogging of Kelvin waves" reported in e.g. [N. Hietala et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids, 2016].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nonlocal vector calculus on the unit two-sphere using weakly singular integral operators. Within this framework, the operators are diagonalizable in terms of scalar and vector spherical harmonics, a property that facilitates the proof of a nonlocal Stokes theorem. This constitutes the first instance of such a theorem on a curved surface. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates the strong convergence of these nonlocal operators to the classical differential operators of vector calculus as the interaction range tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Space- and Time-Dependent Source Identification Problem with Integral Overdetermination Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the inverse problem of determining the right-hand side of the subdiffusion equation with the Caputo derivative with respect to time. In our case, the inverse problem consists in restoring the coefficient of the right-hand side, which depends on both the time and the spatial variable, when measured in integral form. Previously, similar inverse problems were studied for hyperbolic and parabolic equations with a different overdetermination condition, and in some works the existence and uniqueness of generalized solutions was established, while in others, the uniqueness of classical solutions was established. However, similar inverse problems for fractional equations with an integral overdetermination condition have not been considered before this work. The existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to the inverse problem under consideration is established. It is noteworthy that the results obtained are new for parabolic equations as well.</description>

      <title>Restriction for Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a transference principle, asserting that every restriction estimate satisfied by the Fourier transform in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is likewise valid for the propagator of certain Schr\"odinger equations. We consider smooth Hamiltonians with an at most quadratic growth, and also a class of nonsmooth Hamiltonians, encompassing potentials that are Fourier transforms of complex (finite) measures. Roughly speaking, if the initial datum belongs to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, for $p$ in a suitable range of exponents, the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ (for each fixed $t$, with the exception of certain particular values) can be meaningfully restricted to compact curved submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The underlying property responsible for this phenomenon is the boundedness $L^p\to(\mathcal{F}L^p)_{\rm loc}$, with $1\leq p\leq2$, of the propagator, which is derived from almost diagonalization and dispersive estimates in certain function spaces defined in terms of wave packet decompositions in phase space.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation in a moving domain under a Neumann type boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation with $p&gt;2$ in a moving domain under a Neumann type boundary condition corresponding to the total mass conservation. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution by the Galerkin method in evolving Bochner spaces and a monotonicity argument. The main difficulty is in characterizing the weak limit of the nonlinear gradient term, where we need to deal with a term which comes from the boundary condition and cannot be absorbed into a monotone operator. To overcome this difficulty, we prove a uniform-in-time Friedrichs type inequality on a moving domain with time-dependent basis functions and make use of it to get the strong convergence of approximate solutions. We also show that the time derivative exists in the $L^2$ sense when given data have a better regularity.</description>

      <title>Critical points of the Moser-Trudinger functional on conical singular surfaces, I: compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\Sigma, g_1)$ be a compact Riemann surface with conical singularites of angles in $(0, 2\pi)$, and $f: \Sigma\to\mathbb R$ be a positive smooth function. In this paper, by establishing a sharp quantization result, we prove the compactness of the set of positive critical points for the Moser-Trudinger functional
  \[F_1(u)=\int_{\Sigma}(e^{u^2}-1)f dv_{g_1}\] constrained to $u\in\mathcal E_\beta:=\{u\in H^1(\Sigma,g_1) : \|u\|_{H^1(\Sigma,g_1)}^2=\beta\}$ for any $\beta&gt;0$. This result is a generalization of the compactness result for the Moser-Trudinger functional on regular compact surfaces, proved by De Marchis-Malchiodi-Martinazzi-Thizy (Inventiones Mathematicae, 2022, 230: 1165-1248). The presence of conical singularities brings many additional difficulties and we need to develop different ideas and techniques. The compactness lays the foundation for proving the existence of critical points of the Moser-Trudinger functional on conical singular surfaces in a sequel work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish two-sided Gaussian bounds for the fundamental solution of second-order parabolic operators in non-divergence form under minimal regularity assumptions. Specifically, we show that the upper and lower bounds follow from the local boundedness property and the weak Harnack inequality for the adjoint operator $P^*$, respectively. This provides a simpler and more direct proof of the Gaussian estimates when the coefficients have Dini mean oscillation in $x$, avoiding the use of normalized adjoint solutions required in previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We mainly study global in-time asymptotic behavior for the nonlocal reaction-diffusion system with fractional Laplacians which models dispersal of individuals between two exchanging environments for its diffusive components and incorporates the Fujita-type power nonlinearities for its reactive components. We derive a global in-time existence result in the super-critical case, and large time asymptotic profiles of global in-time solutions in the general $L^m$ framework. As a byproduct, the sharp lower bound estimates of lifespan for local in-time solutions in the sub-critical and critical cases are determined. These results extend the existence part of [S. Tr\'eton, SIAM J. Math. Anal. (2024)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of a family of closed curves evolving on an embedded or immersed manifold in three dimensional Euclidean space according to the geometric evolution law. We derive a system of nonlinear parabolic equations describing the motion of curves belonging to a given two-dimensional manifold. We consider both embedded and immersed manifolds. Using the abstract theory of analytic semiflows, we prove the local existence, uniqueness of H\"older smooth solutions to the governing system of nonlinear parabolic equations for the position vector parametrization of evolving curves. We apply the method of flowing finite volumes in combination with the methods of lines for numerical approximation of the governing equations. Numerical experiments support the analytical conclusions and demonstrate the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the wave equation with a repulsive potential, either on the half line ${\mathbb R}^+$ or the Euclidean space ${\mathbb R}^d$ with $d\geq 3$. We combine the operator theory and the inward/outward energy theory to deduce a modified wave operator for repulsive potentials decaying like $|x|^{-\beta}$ with $\beta&gt;1/3$. In particular the regular wave operator without modification exists if $\beta&gt;1$. This implies that the asymptotic behaviour of finite-energy solutions to the wave equation $u_{tt} - \Delta u + |x|^{-\beta} u =0$ is similar to that of the solutions to the classic wave equation if $\beta \in (1,2)$.</description>

Abstract: This work establishes a scaling limit theorem for the Stefan problem incorporating a mushy region, demonstrating that solutions to stochastic variants with turbulent transport terms converge to the solution to a deterministic partial differential equation. The analysis builds upon recent advances in stochastic phase-change modeling and turbulent flow mathematics in [5]. In the physical interpretation of an ice melting process, our result shows that turbulence accelerates ice melting.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the effect of a Signorini-type interface condition on the asymptotic behaviour, as {\epsilon} tends to zero, of a problem posed in an open bounded cylinder of {R^N}, {N\geq 2}, divided in two connected components by an imperfect rough surface. The Signorini-type condition is expressed by means of two complementary equalities involving the jump of the solution on the interface and its conormal derivative via a parameter {\gamma}. Different limit problems are obtained according to the values of {\gamma} and the amplitude of the interface oscillations.</description>

      <title>Breather solutions for semilinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence of real-valued, time-periodic and spatially localized solutions (breathers) of semilinear wave equations $V(x)u_{tt} - u_{xx} = \Gamma(x) |u|^{p-1} u$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ for all values of $p\in (1,\infty)$. Using tools from the calculus of variations our main result provides breathers as ground states of an indefinite functional under suitable conditions on $V, \Gamma$ beyond the limitations of pure $x$-periodicity. Such an approach requires a detailed analysis of the wave operator acting on time-periodic functions. Hence a generalization of the Floquet-Bloch theory for periodic Sturm-Liouville operators is needed which applies to perturbed periodic operators. For this purpose we develop a suitable functional calculus for the weighted operator $-\frac{1}{V(x)}\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2}$ with an explicit control of its spectral measure. Based on this we prove embedding theorems from the form domain of the wave operator into $L^q$-spaces, which is key to controlling nonlinearities. We complement our existence theory with explicit examples of coefficient functions $V$ and temporal periods $T$ which support breathers.</description>

      <title>An Intersection Principle for Mean Curvature Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The avoidance principle says that mean curvature flows of hypersurfaces remain disjoint if they are disjoint at the initial time. We prove several generalizations of the avoidance principle that allow for intersections of hypersurfaces. First, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of two mean curvature flows is non-increasing over time, and we find precise information on how the dimension changes. We then show that the self-intersection of an immersed mean curvature flow has non-increasing dimension over time. Next, we extend the intersection dimension monotonicity to Brakke flows and level set flows which satisfy a localizability condition, and we provide examples showing that the monotonicity fails for general weak solutions. We find a localization result for level set flows with finitely many singularities, and as a consequence, we obtain a fattening criterion for these flows which depends on the behavior of intersections with smooth flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main theorem of this paper states that the c-convexity and the alternative c-convexity are equivalent if and only if the cost function c satisfies MTW condition. The alternative c-convex function is an analogy of the definition of the convex function that is using the inequality phi(t x1 + (1 - t) x0) &lt;= t phi(x1) + (1 - t) phi(x0). We study properties of the alternative c-convex functions and MTW condition, then prove the main theorem.</description>

      <title>Generalised principal eigenvalues and global survival of branching Markov processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study necessary and sufficient criteria for global survival of discrete or continuous-time branching Markov processes. We relate these to several definitions of generalised principle eigenvalues for elliptic operators due to Berestycki and Rossi. In doing so, we extend these notions to fairly general semigroups of linear positive operators. We use this relation to prove new results about the generalised principle eigenvalues, as well as about uniqueness and non-uniqueness of stationary solutions of a generalised FKPP equation. The probabilistic approach through branching processes gives rise to relatively simple and transparent proofs under much more general assumptions, as well as constructions of (counter-)examples to certain conjectures.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Production Planning: Optimal Control and Analytical Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates a stochastic production planning problem with a running cost composed of quadratic production costs and inventory-dependent costs. The objective is to minimize the expected cost until production stops when inventory reaches a specified level, subject to a boundary condition. Using probability space and Brownian motion, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is derived, and optimal feedback control is obtained. The solution demonstrates desirable monotonicity and convexity properties under specific assumptions. An illustrative example further confirms these results with explicit function properties and a practical application.</description>

      <title>On singularity of $p$-energy measures on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, we prove that for a $p$-energy on a metric measure space, under the volume doubling condition, the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality both with $p$-walk dimension strictly larger than $p$ implies the singularity of the associated $p$-energy measure with respect to the underlying measure. We also prove that under the slow volume regular condition, the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the resistance estimate. As a direct corollary, on a large family of fractals and metric measure spaces, including the Sierpi\'nski gasket and the Sierpi\'nski carpet, we obtain the singularity of the $p$-energy measure with respect to the underlying measure for all $p$ strictly great than the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve the even capillary $L_p$-Minkowski problem for the range $-n &lt; p &lt; 1$ and $\theta \in (0,\frac{\pi}{2})$. Our approach is based on an iterative scheme that builds on the solution to the capillary Minkowski problem (i.e., the case $p = 1$) and leverages the monotonicity of a class of functionals under a family of capillary curvature image operators. These operators are constructed so that their fixed points, whenever they exist, correspond precisely to solutions of the capillary $L_p$-Minkowski problem.</description>

      <title>Spectral asymptotics of semi-classical Toeplitz operators on Levi non-degenerate CR manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider any compact CR manifold whose Levi form is non-degenerate of constant signature $(n_-,n_+)$, $n_-+n_+=n$. For $\lambda&gt;0$ and $q\in\{0,\cdots,n\}$, we let $\Pi_\lambda^{(q)}$ be the spectral projection of the Kohn Laplacian of $(0,q)$-forms corresponding to the interval $[0,\lambda]$. For certain classical pseudodifferential operators $P$, we study a class of generalized elliptic Toeplitz operators $T_{P,\lambda}^{(q)}:=\Pi_\lambda^{(q)}\circ P\circ \Pi_\lambda^{(q)}$. For any cut-off $\chi\in\mathscr C^\infty_c(\mathbb R\setminus\{0\})$, we establish the full asymptotics of the semi-classical spectral projector $\chi(k^{-1}T_{P,\lambda}^{(q)})$ as $k\to+\infty$. Our main result conclude that the smooth Schwartz kernel $\chi(k^{-1}T_{P,\lambda}^{(n_-)})(x,y)$ is the sum of two semi-classical oscillatory integrals with complex-valued phase functions.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit of Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The derivation of effective descriptions for interacting many-body systems is an important branch of applied mathematics. We prove a propagation of chaos result for a system of $N$ particles subject to Newtonian time evolution with or without additional white noise influencing the velocities of the particles. We assume that the particles interact according to a regularized Coulomb-interaction with a regularization parameter that vanishes in the $N\to\infty$ limit. The respective effective description is the so called Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck (VPFP), respectively the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) equation in the case of no or sub-dominant white noise. To obtain our result we combine the relative entropy method from \cite{jabinWang2016} with the control on the difference between the trajectories of the true and the effective description provided in \cite{HLP20} for the VPFP case respectively in \cite{LP} for the VP case. This allows us to prove strong convergence of the marginals, i.e. convergence in $L^1$.</description>

      <title>Net-Zero: A Comparative Study on Neural Network Design for Climate-Economic PDEs Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate-economic modeling under uncertainty presents significant computational challenges that may limit policymakers' ability to address climate change effectively. This paper explores neural network-based approaches for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems arising from models that incorporate ambiguity aversion in climate mitigation decisions. We develop a continuous-time endogenous-growth economic model that accounts for multiple mitigation pathways, including emission-free capital and carbon intensity reductions. Given the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of these models, traditional numerical methods become computationally intractable. We benchmark several neural network architectures against finite-difference generated solutions, evaluating their ability to capture the dynamic interactions between uncertainty, technology transitions, and optimal climate policy. Our findings demonstrate that appropriate neural architecture selection significantly impacts both solution accuracy and computational efficiency when modeling climate-economic systems under uncertainty. These methodological advances enable more sophisticated modeling of climate policy decisions, allowing for better representation of technology transitions and uncertainty-critical elements for developing effective mitigation strategies in the face of climate change.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the null controllability of nonlinear wave systems. Initially, we employ a combination of the Galerkin method and a fixed point theorem to establish the null controllability for semi-linear wave equations with nonlinear functions that are dependent on velocities, under the geometric control condition. Subsequently, utilizing a novel iterative method, we demonstrate the null controllability for a class of quasi-linear wave systems in a constructive manner. Lastly, we present a control result for a class of fully nonlinear wave systems, serving as an application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the inverse spectral transform for the conservative Camassa-Holm flow on the line to a class of initial data that requires strong decay at one endpoint but only mild boundedness-type conditions at the other endpoint. The latter condition appears to be close to optimal in a certain sense for the well-posedness of the conservative Camassa-Holm flow. As a byproduct of our approach, we also find a family of new (almost) conservation laws for the Camassa-Holm equation, which could not be deduced from its bi-Hamiltonian structure before and which are connected to certain Besov-type norms (however, in a rather involved way). These results appear to be new even under positivity assumptions on the corresponding momentum, in which case the conservative Camassa-Holm flow coincides with the classical Camassa-Holm flow and no blow-ups occur.</description>

      <title>A well-posedness result for the compressible two-fluid model with density-dependent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a system of PDEs describing the motion of two compressible viscous fluids occupying the whole space $\mathbb R^d\;(d\in \{2,3\}$). The two phases of the mixture are separated by a $\mathscr{C}^{1+\alpha}$-regular sharp interface $\mathcal{C}$ across which the density can experience jumps. We prove the existence of a unique local-in-time solution assuming that the initial density is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous on both sides of $\mathcal{C}$. The initial velocity belongs to the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb R^d)$, and the divergence of the initial stress tensor belongs to $L^2(\mathbb R^d)$. The later assumption expresses somehow the continuity of the stress tensor. This result is more general than the one by Tani [32], as it allows for less regular initial data and furthermore it can serve as a building block for the construction of global-in-time solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss existence and finite speed of propagation for the solutions to an initial-boundary value problem for a family of fractional thin-film equations in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The nonlocal operator we consider is the spectral fractional Laplacian with Neumann boundary conditions. In the case of a ``strong slippage'' regime with ``complete wetting'' interfacial conditions, we prove local entropy estimates that entail finite speed of propagation of the support and a lower bound for the waiting time phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a diffuse-interface Landau-de Gennes free energy for nematic liquid crystals (NLC) systems, with free boundaries, in three dimensions submerged in isotropic liquid, and a phase field is introduced to model the deformable interface. The energy consists of the original Landau-de Gennes free energy, three penalty terms and a volume constraint. We prove the existence and regularity of minimizers for the diffuse-interface energy functional. We also prove a uniform maximum principle of the minimizer under appropriate assumptions, together with a uniqueness result for small domains. Then, we establish a sharp-interface limit where minimizers of the diffuse-interface energy converge to a minimizer of a sharp-interface energy using methods from $\Gamma$-convergence. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments with the diffuse-interface model and the findings are compared with existing works.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we consider anisotropic degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equations and degenerate quasilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We prove the equivalence of two notions of entropy and viscosity solutions of two equations, and apply it to obtain a large-time behavior of viscosity solutions to quasilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and entropy solutions to degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equations in a periodic setting.</description>

      <title>Tunamis on a deep open sea and on a sloping beach -- a mathematical theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17269v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approaching a sloping beach, shallow water surface waves of Airy get suddenly $ +\infty$ or $ -\infty$ propagation speed at the point of surface $x = x_0$, say, where the tangent $\varGamma_x$ of the surface $y = \varGamma$ "coincide" with that $b_x$ of the water-bottom $y = b(x)$, losing the cruising sound speed of propagation so high on a deep open sea. That is, the tunamis gain instantaneously a $ +\infty$ propagation speed just before the crest as $(\varGamma_x - b_x)(x) \to +0$, $x \to x_0\!-\!0$ , and a $ -\infty$ propagation speed just after the trough as $(\varGamma_x - b_x)(x) \to -0$, $x \to x_0\!-\!0$. We would have thus a big crush between the crest rushing forward and the trough rushing backward. This is a mathematical structure of tunamis "on" a sloping beach, in particular.</description>

Abstract: We construct a long-time asymptotic profile to the initial value problem of the n-dimensional heat equation. Specifically, we present a modified heat kernel as a long-time asymptotic profile which changes the mass, the center of mass and the variance of the n-dimensional heat kernel in accordance with the moments of the initial data.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation in high dimensional critical electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation with scaling-critical electromagnetic potentials in dimensions $n\geq3$. The decay assumption on the magnetic potentials is critical, including the case of the Coulomb potential. Our approach introduces novel techniques, notably the construction of Schwartz kernels for the localized Schr\"odinger propagator, which separates the antipodal points of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, in these scaling critical electromagnetic fields. This method enables us to prove the $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)\to L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the localized Schr\"odinger propagator, as well as global Strichartz estimates. Our results provide a positive answer to the open problem posed in arXiv:0901.4024 arXiv:1611.04805 arXiv:0806.0778, and fill a longstanding gap left by arXiv:arXiv:0705.0546 arXiv:archive/0608699.</description>

      <title>Jumps, cusps and fractals in the solution of the periodic linear Benjamin-Ono equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish two complementary results about the regularity of the solution of the periodic initial value problem for the linear Benjamin-Ono equation. We first give a new simple proof of the statement that, for a dense countable set of the time variable, the solution is a finite linear combination of copies of the initial condition and of its Hilbert transform. In particular, this implies that discontinuities in the initial condition are propagated in the solution as logarithmic cusps. We then show that, if the initial condition is of bounded variation (and even if it is not continuous), for almost every time the graph of the solution in space is continuous but fractal, with upper Minkowski dimension equal to 3/2. In order to illustrate this striking dichotomy, in the final section we include accurate numerical evaluations of the solution profile, as well as estimates of its box-counting dimension for two canonical choices of irrational time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ohta examined a system of multiple speed wave equations with small initial data and demonstrated a finite time blowup. We show, in the radial case, that the same system exists almost globally with the same lifespan as a lower bound. To do this, we use integrated local energy estimate, $r^p$ weighted local energy estimates, the Morawetz estimate that results from using the scaling vector field as a multiplier, and mixed speed ghost weights.</description>

Abstract: We establish a complete Widder Theory for the fractional fast diffusion equation. Our work focuses on nonnegative solutions satisfying a certain integral size condition at infinity. We prove that these solutions possess a Radon measure as initial trace, and prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions originating from such initial data. The uniqueness result is the main issue. Most of its difficulty comes from the singular character of the nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multidimensional inverse scattering problem under the time-dependent repulsive Hamiltonian. The time-dependent coefficient on the repulsive term decays as the inverse square of time, which is the threshold between the standard free Schroedinger operator and the time-independent repulsive Hamiltonian. Applying the Enss-Weder time-dependent method, we can determine uniquely the short-range potential functions with Coulomb-like singularities from the velocity limit of the scattering operator.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present some applications of the $L^p$-$L^q$ boundedness of Fourier multipliers to PDEs on the noncommutative (or quantum) Euclidean space. More precisely, we establish $L^p$-$L^q$ norm estimates for solutions of heat, wave, and Schr\"odinger type equations with Caputo fractional derivative in the case $1 &lt; p \leq 2 \leq q &lt; \infty.$ Moreover, we obtain well-posedness of nonlinear heat and wave equations on the noncommutative Euclidean space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the semilinear heat equation with a superlinear nonlinearity and we study the properties of threshold or subthreshold solutions, lying on or below the boundary between blow-up and global existence, respectively. For the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem, we prove the boundedness of any subthreshold solution. This implies, in particular, that all global unbounded solutions -- if they exist -- are threshold solutions. For the Cauchy problem, these properties fail in general but we show that they become true for a suitably modified notion of threshold. Our results strongly improve known results even in the model case of power nonlinearities, especially in the Sobolev critical and supercritical cases.</description>

      <title>Boundary value problem of magnetically insulated diode: existence of solutions and complex bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the stationary self-consistent problem of magnetic insulation for a vacuum diode with space-charge limitation, described by a singularly perturbed Vlasov-Maxwell system of dimension 1.5. The case of insulated diode when the electrons are deflected back towards the cathode at the point $x^{*}$ is considered. First, the initial VM system is reduced to the nonlinear singular limit system of ODEs for the potentials of electric and magnetic fields. The second step deals with the limit system's reduction to the new nonlinear singular ODE equation for effective potential $\theta(x)$. The existence of non-negative solutions is proved for the last equation on the interval $[0, x^{*})$ where $\theta(x)&gt;0$. The most interesting and unexplored case is when $\theta(x)&lt;0$ on the interval $(x^{*}, 1]$ and corresponds to the case of an insulated diode. For the first time, a numerical analysis of complex bifurcation of solutions in insulated diode is considered for $\theta(x)&lt;0$ depending on parameters and boundary conditions. Bifurcation diagrams of the dependence of solution $\theta(x)$ on a free point (free boundary) $x^{*}$ were constructed. Insulated diode spacing is found.</description>

      <title>Sharp asymptotic stability of the incompressible porous media equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the asymptotic stability of the incompressible porous media (IPM) equation near a stable stratified density, for initial perturbations in the Sobolev space $H^k$ with any $2&lt;k \in\mathbb{R}$. While it is known that such a steady state is unstable in $H^2$, our result establishes a sharp stability threshold in higher-order Sobolev spaces.
  The key ingredients of our proof are twofold. First, we extract long-time convergence from the decay of a potential energy functional$-$despite its non-coercive nature$-$thereby revealing a variational structure underlying the dynamics. Second, we derive refined commutator estimates to control the evolution of higher Sobolev norms throughout the full range of $k&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Boundary Stabilization of Quasilinear Parabolic PDEs that Blow Up in Open Loop for Arbitrarily Small Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for stabilization, with an estimate of the region of attraction, of quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit finite-time blow-up phenomena when null boundary inputs are imposed. Using Neumann-type boundary controllers, which are cubic polynomials in boundary measurements, we ensure L2 exponential stability of the origin with an estimate of the region of attraction, boundedness and exponential decay towards zero of the state's max norm, well-posedness, as well as positivity of solutions starting from positive initial conditions. Unlike existing methods, our approach handles nonlinear state-dependent diffusion, convection, and reaction terms. In many cases, our estimate of the size of the region of attraction is shown to expand unboundedly as diffusion increases. Our controllers can be implemented as Neumann, Dirichlet, or mixed-type boundary conditions. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our approach in preventing finite-time blow up.</description>

      <title>Classical correspondence beyond the Ehrenfest time for open quantum systems with general Lindbladians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum and classical systems evolving under the same formal Hamiltonian $H$ may dramatically differ after the Ehrenfest timescale $t_E \sim \log(\hbar^{-1})$, even as $\hbar \to 0$. Coupling the system to a Markovian environment results in a Lindblad equation for the quantum evolution. Its classical counterpart is given by the Fokker-Planck equation on phase space, which describes Hamiltonian flow with friction and diffusive noise. The quantum and classical evolutions may be compared via the Wigner-Weyl representation. Due to decoherence, they are conjectured to match closely for times far beyond the Ehrenfest timescale as $\hbar \to 0$. We prove a version of this correspondence, bounding the error between the quantum and classical evolutions for any sufficiently regular Hamiltonian $H(x,p)$ and Lindblad functions $L_k(x,p)$. The error is small when the strength of the diffusion $D$ associated to the Lindblad functions satisfies $D \gg \hbar^{4/3}$, which allows vanishing noise in the classical limit. Our method uses a time-dependent semiclassical mixture of variably squeezed Gaussian states. The states evolve according to a local harmonic approximation to the Lindblad dynamics. Both the exact quantum trajectory and its classical counterpart can be expressed as perturbations of this semiclassical mixture, with the errors bounded using Duhamel's principle. We present heuristic arguments suggesting the $4/3$ exponent is optimal and defines a boundary in the sense that asymptotically weaker diffusion permits a breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence at the Ehrenfest timescale. In a shorter companion paper, we treat the special case of Hamiltonians that decompose into kinetic and potential energy with linear Lindblad operators, with explicit bounds that can be applied directly to physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a boundary integral formulation for the dynamic problem of electromagnetic scattering and transmission by homogeneous dielectric obstacles. In the spirit of Costabel and Stephan, we use the transmission conditions to reduce the number of unknown densities and to formulate a system of coupled boundary integral equations describing the scattered and transmitted waves. The system is transformed into the Laplace domain where it is proven to be stable and uniquely solvable. The Laplace domain stability estimates are then used to establish the stability and unique solvability of the original time domain problem. Finally, we show how the bounds obtained in both Laplace and time domains can be used to derive error estimates for semi discrete Galerkin discretizations in space and for fully discrete numerical schemes that use Convolution Quadrature for time discretization and a conforming Galerkin method for discretization of the space variables.</description>

      <title>H\"{o}lder continuous solutions to stochastic 3D Euler equations via stochastic convex integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the three dimensional Euler equations driven by an additive stochastic forcing. First, we construct global H\"{o}lder continuous (stationary) solutions in $C(\mathbb{R};C^{\vartheta})$ space for some $\vartheta&gt;0$ via a different method from \cite{LZ24}. Our approach is based on applying stochastic convex integration to the construction of Euler flows in \cite{DelSze13} to derive uniform moment estimates independent of time. Second, for any divergence-free H\"{o}lder continuous initial condition, we show the existence of infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $L^p_{\rm{loc}}([0,\infty);C^{\vartheta'}) \cap C_{\rm{loc}}([0,\infty);H^{-1})$ for all $p\in [1,\infty)$ and some $\vartheta'&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>A proof of Onsager's conjecture for the stochastic 3D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stochastic 3D Euler equations on a periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^3$, driven by a $GG^*$-Wiener process $B$ of trace class:
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d} u+\mathrm{div}(u\otimes u)\,\mathrm{d} t+\nabla p\,\mathrm{d}t=\mathrm{d}B, \quad \mathrm{div} u=0.
  \end{align*} First, for any $\vartheta&lt;1/3$, we construct infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions $u\in C([0,\infty),C^{\vartheta}(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R}^3))$. These solutions dissipate the energy pathwisely up to a stopping time $\mathfrak{t}$, which can be chosen arbitrarily large with high probability, i.e. it holds almost surely
  \begin{align*}
  \|u(t\wedge\mathfrak{t})\|_{L^2}^2&lt; \|u(s\wedge\mathfrak{t})\|_{L^2}^2 +2 \int_{s\wedge\mathfrak{t}}^{t\wedge\mathfrak{t}} \big\langle u(r), \mathrm{d} B(r) \big\rangle +\mathrm{Tr}\big(GG^*\big) (t\wedge\mathfrak{t}-s\wedge\mathfrak{t}),
  \end{align*}
  for any $0\leq s &lt; t&lt;\infty$. We also provide a brief proof of energy conservation for $\vartheta&gt;1/3$ based on \cite{CET94}, thereby confirming the Onsager theorem for the stochastic 3D Euler equations. Second, let $0&lt;\bar{\vartheta}&lt;\bar{\beta}&lt;1/3$, we construct infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $C([0,\infty),C^{\bar{\vartheta}}(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R}^3))$ for arbitrary divergence-free initial data in $C^{\bar{\beta}}(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R}^3)$. Our construction relies on the convex integration method developed in the deterministic setting by \cite{Ise18}, adapting it to the stochastic context by introducing a novel energy inequality into the convex integration scheme and combining stochastic analysis arguments with a Wong--Zakai type estimate.</description>

      <title>The capillary $L_p$-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our recent work [54] concerning the capillary Minkowski problem. We propose, in this paper, a capillary $L_p$-Minkowski problem for $p\geq 1$, which seeks to find a capillary convex body with a prescribed capillary $L_p$-surface area measure in the Euclidean half-space. This formulation provides a natural Robin boundary analogue of the classical $L_p$-Minkowski problem introduced by Lutwak [43]. For $p&gt;1$, we resolve the capillary $L_p$-Minkowski problem in the smooth category by reducing it to a Monge-Amp\`ere equation with a Robin boundary condition on the unit spherical cap.</description>
