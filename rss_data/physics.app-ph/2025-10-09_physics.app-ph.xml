      <title>A Flux-Tunable Discrete Angular Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Lawrie et al. [PRR 7, 023209 (2025)] introduced a non-diffracting resonant angular filter on a network of thin channels (modelled via quantum graph theory) that exhibits unit transmission of acoustic waves at a discrete, symmetry-paired set of incidence angles determined solely by the graph topology, while transmission at all other angles is strictly forbidden. In the present work, we study the same filtering geometry for waves governed by the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation rather than the classical wave equation. Using a phase shift induced by non-reciprocal wave propagation due to the presence of the magnetic potential and tuning $\delta$-type vertex boundary conditions, we make the previously topology-fixed discrete pass directions continuously tunable: both the transmission angle and the transmission coefficient become control parameters. The resulting flux-tunable angular filtering device replaces topology-constrained passbands with a programmable steering device, broadening the scope for wave-filter and beam-shaping applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Breakdown Voltage in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky Barrier Diodes via Fast Neutron Irradiation and Electrothermal Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of fast neutron irradiation and post-radiation electro-thermal annealing on the electrical performance of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky barrier diodes. Devices irradiated with 1 MeV neutrons at a high fluence of 1E15 n/cm^2 exhibited substantial degradation, including a drastic reduction in on-current and an increase in on-resistance. Electrothermal testing, conducted through simultaneous current-voltage (J-V) measurements and thermal annealing, resulted in significant recovery. After four cycles of electro-thermal testing, the devices demonstrated significant improvements in performance, with a substantial recovery of on-current and a reduction in on-resistance compared to the post-radiation condition, approaching pre-radiation levels. Most recovery occurred during the first two cycles, with diminishing improvements in later cycles, indicating that most thermally recoverable traps were mitigated early. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements revealed a substantial reduction in carrier concentration, decreasing from 3.2E16 cm^-3 pre-radiation to 5.5E15 cm^-3 after the first electro-thermal testing cycle, indicating an over 82% reduction. Following the third cycle, the carrier concentration partially recovered to 9.9E15 cm^-3, reflecting a carrier removal rate of ~22 cm^-1. The breakdown voltage exhibited a remarkable enhancement, increasing from approximately 300 V to 1.28 kV (a ~325% improvement) after the first electro-thermal testing, attributed to the reduction in carrier concentration by compensating radiation-induced traps. Subsequent testing reduced breakdown voltage slightly to 940 V due to partial recovery of carrier concentration, but it remained significantly higher than pre-radiation levels, highlighting the promise of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ power devices for high-power applications in radiation-intense environments.</description>

      <title>Physical learning in reprogrammable metamaterials for adaptation to unknown environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reprogrammable mechanical metamaterials, composed of a lattice of discretely adaptive elements, are emerging as a promising platform for mechanical intelligence. To operate in unknown environments, such structures must go beyond passive responsiveness and embody traits of mechanical intelligence: sensing, computing, adaptation, and memory. However, current approaches fall short, as computation of the required adaptation in response to changes in environmental stimuli must be pre-computed ahead of operation. Here we present a physical learning approach that harnesses the structure's mechanics to perform computation and drive adaptation. The desired global deformation response of nonlinear metamaterials with adaptive stiffness is physically encoded as local strain targets across internal adaptive elements. The structure adapts by iteratively interacting with the environment and updating its stiffness distribution using a model-free algorithm. The resulting system demonstrates autonomous real-time adaptation (~seconds) to previously unknown loading conditions without pre-computation. Physical learning inherently accounts for manufacturing imperfections and is robust to sensor noise and structural damage. We also demonstrate scalability to complex metamaterial structures and different metamaterial architectures. By uniting sensing, computation, and actuation in a mechanical framework, this work makes key strides towards embodying the traits of mechanical intelligence into adaptive structures. We expect our approach to open pathways towards in-situ adaptation to unknown environment for applications in hypersonic flight, adaptive robotics, and exploration in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Low and high frequency noise in LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LED degradation is usually associated with defects in the active region. Whereby the noise analysis can be a strong instrument to reveal them. The results of optical noise measurements for commercially available blue LED samples in a wide frequency range from kHz to MHz are reported. Noise spectra were decomposed into components according to the presented theoretical model which includes 1/f-type noise, generation-recombination noise, and white noise. The 1/f$^\gamma$-type noise was modeled as a superposition of generation-recombination noise components at defects with a continuous wide distribution of relaxation lifetimes. The coincidence of the experimental results with 1/f$^\gamma$ model for the low frequency range is proved and a fitting is made. We identified three noise components that are highly current-dependent. The corresponding model of temperature dependence for the low-frequency range was developed. At low currents, the model partially matched the experimental results in the temperature range from 100 K to 300 K at low frequencies. However, high-frequency measurements showed deviations from the expected Lorentzian behavior.</description>

      <title>Lamb wave-based MVDR imaging and CNN classification of defects in pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in ultrasonic guided wave (UGW) technology for pipe signal processing and defect imaging recently. However, developing a defect localization and imaging algorithm that requires fewer parameters, offers a wide imaging range, and achieves high positioning accuracy remains a considerable challenge. Traditional direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods primarily focus on the single-angle estimation with low resolution, failing to satisfy the spatial localization requirements for pipeline defects. Therefore, a high-resolution spatial spectrum estimation algorithm is introduced to realize the two-dimensional DOA estimation. By distributing multiple sensors in a specific geometric configuration to form an array, this method employs the array signal processing technology to accurately obtain the DOA of spatial signals. A uniform circular array (UCA) is employed in the present study to receive signals from pipe defects, and high-precision localization and imaging of defects are achieved based on the two-dimensional minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming algorithm, with a relative positioning error of less than 1%. An image classification method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) is further developed to distinguish the defect types. By constructing a novel CNN model to extract defect features and perform classification, this model achieves a prediction accuracy of 97.50%, which effectively distinguishes between defect types.</description>

      <title>Corrigendum to "Degree-Based Approximations for Network Reliability Polynomials". Comment on J. Complex Networks 2025, 13, cnaf001</title>

Abstract: Our original paper \cite{VanMieghem2025} described the stochastic approximation $\overline{rel}_G(p)=\bigl[1-\phi_D(1-p)\bigr]^{N}$ in \cite[eq. (2.2)]{VanMieghem2025} and the first-order approximation $(R_1)_G(p)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\!\bigl[1-(1-p)^{d_i}\bigr]$ in \cite[eq. (4.1)]{VanMieghem2025} as upper bounds for the all-terminal reliability polynomial \(rel_G(p)\). The present corrigendum clarifies that the unique upper bound is \(\Pr[\hat D_{\min}\geq 1]\), which is difficult to compute exactly, because we must account for correlated node-isolation events. Both the stochastic approximation $\overline{rel}_G$ and the first-order approximation $(R_1)_G$ ignore those correlations, assume independence and, consequently, do not always upperbound \(rel_G(p)\) as stated previously. The complete graph \(K_{3}\) is a counterexample, where both approximations lie below the exact reliability polynomial $rel_{K_3}(p)$, illustrating that they are not upper bounds. Moreover, as claimed in \cite{VanMieghem2025}, the first-order approximation $(R_1)_G$ is not always more accurate than the stochastic approximation $\overline{rel}_G$. We show by an example that the relative accuracy of the stochastic approximation $\overline{rel}_G$ and the first-order approximation $(R_1)_G$ varies with the graph $G$ and the link operational probability $p$. }{network robustness, node failure, probabilistic graph, reliability polynomial</description>

      <title>Prediction of Molecular Single-Photon Emitters: A Materials-Modelling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacing light with quantum systems is an integral part of quantum technology, with the most essential building block being single-photon emitters. Although various platforms exist, each with its individual strengths, molecular emitters boast a unique advantage -- namely the flexibility to tailor their design to fit the requirements of a specific task. However, the characteristics of the vast space of possible molecular configurations are challenging to understand and explore. Here, we present a theoretical and computational framework to initiate exploration of this vast potential by integrating database analysis with microscopic predictions. Using a model system of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene host as benchmark, our approach identifies promising new candidates, among them a chiral molecular emitter. Future extensions of our approach integrated with machine learning routines hold the promise of ultimately unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum light-matter interfaces.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic ultrafast edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ driven by broken crystal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric (PTE) mechanisms, whose intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Early wind turbine alarm prediction based on machine learning: AlarmForecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alarm data is pivotal in curbing fault behavior in Wind Turbines (WTs) and forms the backbone for advancedpredictive monitoring systems. Traditionally, research cohorts have been confined to utilizing alarm data solelyas a diagnostic tool, merely indicative of unhealthy status. However, this study aims to offer a transformativeleap towards preempting alarms, preventing alarms from triggering altogether, and consequently avertingimpending failures. Our proposed Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework is designed on twosuccessive modules: first, the regression module based on long short-term memory (LSTM) for time-series alarmforecasting, and thereafter, the classification module to implement alarm tagging on the forecasted alarm. Thisway, the entire alarm taxonomy can be forecasted reliably rather than a few specific alarms. 14 Senvion MM82turbines with an operational period of 5 years are used as a case study; the results demonstrated 82%, 52%,and 41% accurate forecasts for 10, 20, and 30 min alarm forecasts, respectively. The results substantiateanticipating and averting alarms, which is significant in curbing alarm frequency and enhancing operationalefficiency through proactive intervention.</description>

      <title>Realistic Threat Models for Fiber and Free-Space Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future global quantum communication networks, or quantum Internet, will realize high-rate secure communication and entanglement distribution for large-scale users over long distances. Continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical devices and the potential to reach high rates. However, the achievable performance of CV-QKD protocols is fundamentally limited by the fact that they appear to be fragile to both loss and noise. In this study, we provide a general framework for analyzing the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol (GMCS) under various levels of trust for the loss and noise experienced by the users of the protocol. Our work is comprehensive of several practical scenarios, encompassing both active and passive eavesdropping configurations, with both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space and satellite-based) quantum communication channels. Our numerical results evaluate the robustness of the GMCS protocol under varying levels of trust and demonstrate that it is difficult for a practical protocol to remain robust against untrusted loss at the transmitter. In the wireless case, we analyze a scenario with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing that its key distribution rate, even with the worst level of trust, can outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters. Our results indicate that, when it comes to engineering and optimizing quantum-safe networks, it is essential to mitigate the shortcomings caused by critical trade-offs between rate performance, trust level, system noise, and communication distance.</description>

      <title>Experimental Results from Early Non-Planar NI-HTS Magnet Prototypes for the Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX) is an upgrade of the Columbia Non-neutral Torus (CNT) that aims to demonstrate a university-scale, quasi-axisymmetric stellarator using high-temperature superconducting (HTS) technology at an on-axis magnetic field target of 0.5 T. Due to the strain sensitivity of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxides), adapting it to non-planar stellarator geometries requires new winding, structural, and cooling strategies. We report on the results of a staged prototype program (P1, P2, P3) employing 3D-printed, sectional aluminum coil frames with winding channels, gimballed constant-tension winding mechanics, and solder potting for radial current redistribution and passive quench mitigation. The first prototype, P1 (planar elliptical, double-pancake) tested additive manufacture, sectional joining and baseline winding, achieving predicted fields at 77 K. P2 (non-planar, higher strain) was wound to 42 turns, energized at 30-40 K to produce expected magnetic fields, and studied thermal gradients and resistance at up to 4.5 kAt. Design evolution in P3 introduces concave geometry with dual double-pancakes, 200 turns, and approaches the 70 kAt target at 20 K. In parallel, sub-microhm lap joints have been developed. Together, these results de-risk manufacturing, cooling interfaces, quench management, and diagnostics, paving the way for full-size non-planar HTS stellarator coils for CSX.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a CMOS-compatible silicon-rich nitride metalens array for visible microscopy at 660 nm. Three co-planar elements provide numerical apertures of 0.54, 0.92, and 0.97, enabling within-sample NA benchmarking without objective swaps. Imaging of annular cell monolayers labeled in the AF647 ZO-1 channel shows progressive sharpening of junctional edges and reduced blur with increasing NA, consistent with diffraction-limited scaling. The compact, planar platform supports direct integration with image sensors, offering a practical route to high-NA fluorescence bioimaging in space-constrained, low-cost systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unique optical properties of quantum dots (QDs), size-tunable emission and high quantum yield, make them ideal candidates for applications in secure quantum communication, quantum computing, targeted single-cell and molecular tagging, and sensing. Scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies for single QDs have, however, remained largely out of reach due to inherent material incompatibilities with conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes. To advance scalable photonic quantum device architectures, it is therefore crucial to adopt placement and heterointegration strategies that can address these challenges. Here, we present an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model, single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing, that exploits a novel regime of nanoscale dielectrophoretics to print and deterministically position single colloidal QDs. Using QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic imprecision that limited previous colloidal deposition strategies, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and single-photon emission from single printed QDs. By enabling deterministic placement of single quantum dots, this method provides a powerful, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.</description>
