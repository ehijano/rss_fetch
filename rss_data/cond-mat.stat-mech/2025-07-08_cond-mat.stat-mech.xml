      <title>Revisiting Multi-Wave Resonance in Classical Lattices: Quasi-Resonances, Not Exact Resonance, Govern Energy Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-wave exact resonance condition is a fundamental principle for understanding energy transfer in condensed matter systems, yet the dynamical evolution of waves satisfying this condition remains unexplored. Here, we reveal that the multi-wave resonant kinetic equations possess distinctive symmetry properties that preferentially induce energy equalization between counter-propagating waves of identical frequency. This initial equalization disrupts the exact resonance condition, rendering it dynamically invalid. We further demonstrate that nonlinearity-mediated multi-wave quasi-resonances--not exact resonances--overn energy transfer and drive the system toward thermalization. Crucially, the strength of exact resonances decays with increasing system size, while quasi-resonance strength grows. Moreover, exact resonance strength remains independent of nonlinearity, whereas quasi-resonance strength diminishes with reduced nonlinearity. These observations provide additional evidence supporting the aforementioned conclusion while elucidating the size-dependent thermalization characteristics in lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Proxitaxis: an adaptive search strategy based on proximity and stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{proxitaxis}, a simple search strategy where the searcher has only information about the distance from the target but not the direction. The strategy consists of three crucial components: (i) local adaptive moves with distance-dependent hopping rate, (ii) intermittent long range returns via stochastic resetting to a certain location $\vec{R}_0$, and (iii) an inspection move where the searcher dynamically updates the resetting position $\vec{R}_0$. We compute analytically the capture probability of the target within this strategy and show that it can be maximized by an optimal choice of the control parameters of this strategy. Moreover, the optimal strategy undergoes multiple phase transitions as a function of the control parameters. These phase transitions are generic and occur in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Excess dissipation shapes symmetry breaking in non-equilibrium currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most natural thermodynamic systems operate far from equilibrium, developing persistent currents and organizing into non-equilibrium stationary states (NESSs). Yet, the principles by which such systems self-organize, breaking equilibrium symmetries under external and internal constraints, remain unclear. Here, we establish a general connection between symmetry breaking and dissipation in mesoscopic stochastic systems described by Langevin dynamics. Using a geometric framework based on the inverse diffusion matrix, we decompose the velocity field into excess (gradient) and housekeeping (residual) components. This provides a natural entropy production split: the excess part captures internal reorganization under non-equilibrium conditions, while the housekeeping part quantifies detailed-balance violation due to external forces. We derive an exact equality linking the two, along with an inequality identifying accessible thermodynamics. A weak-noise expansion of the stationary solution reveals the general geometry of the NESS velocity field, enabling a unified classification of steady states. We apply this framework to systems ranging from molecular machines to coupled oscillators, showing how symmetry breaking in trajectory space constrains NESS organization. We further extend our approach to systems with multiplicative noise, deriving how additional symmetry breaking relates to curved (space-dependent) metrics. Finally, we show that both the NESS velocity field and stationary distribution can be derived through variational functionals based on excess dissipation. This work sheds light on the intimate connection between geometric features, dissipative properties, and symmetry breaking, uncovering a classification of NESSs that reflects how emergent organization reflects physical non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating non-equilibrium trajectories via mean back relaxation: Dependence on length and time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>A simpler probe of the quantum Mpemba effect in closed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local relaxation of closed quantum systems through the relative entropy between the reduced density matrix and its long time limit. We show, using analytic arguments combined with numerical checks, that this relative entropy can be very well approximated by an entropy difference, affording a significant computational advantage. We go on to relate this to the entanglement asymmetry of the subsystem with respect to time translation invariance. In doing this, we obtain a simple probe of the relaxation dynamics of closed many-body systems and use it to re-examine the quantum Mpemba effect, wherein states can relax faster if they are initially further from equilibrium. We reproduce earlier instances of the effect related to symmetry restoration as well as uncover new cases in the absence of such symmetries. For integrable models, we obtain the criteria for this to occur using the quasiparticle picture. Lastly, we show that, in models obeying the entanglement membrane picture, the quantum Mpemba effect cannot occur for a large class of initial states.</description>

      <title>A Hydrodynamic Theory for Non-Equilibrium Full Counting Statistics in One-Dimensional Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of charge fluctuations after homogeneous quantum quenches in one-dimensional systems with ballistic transport. For short but macroscopic times where the non-trivial dynamics is largely dominated by long-range correlations, a simple expression for the associated full counting statistics can be obtained by hydrodynamic arguments. This formula links the non-equilibrium charge fluctuation after the quench to the fluctuations of the associated current after a charge-biased inhomogeneous modification of the original quench which corresponds to the paradigmatic partitioning protocol. Under certain assumptions, the fluctuations in the latter case can be expressed by explicit closed form formulas in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities via the Ballistic Fluctuations Theory. In this work, we identify precise physical conditions for the applicability of a fully hydrodynamic theory, and provide a detailed analysis explicitly demonstrating how such conditions are met and how this leads to such hydrodynamic treatment. We discuss these conditions at length in non-relativistic free fermions, where calculations become feasible and allow for cross-checks against exact results. In physically relevant cases, strong long-range correlations can complicate the hydrodynamic picture, but our formula still correctly reproduces the first cumulants.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of stochastic functionals under general resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the characteristic function of stochastic functionals of a random walk whose position is reset to the origin at random times drawn from a general probability distribution. We analyze the long-time behavior and obtain the temporal scaling of the first two moments of any stochastic functional of the random walk when the resetting time distribution exhibits a power-law tail. When the resetting times PDF has finite moments, the probability density of any functional converges to a delta function centered at its mean, indicating an ergodic phase. We explicitly examine the case of the half-occupation time and derive the ergodicity breaking parameter, the first two moments, and the limiting distribution when the resetting time distribution follows a power-law tail, for both Brownian and subdiffusive random walks. We characterize the three different shapes of the limiting distribution as a function of the exponent of the resetting distribution. Our theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo simulations, which show excellent agreement with the analytical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is the core concept for understanding the emergence of collective order. In finite-dimensional systems, however, the nature of the broken phase is often constrained by the compatibility between spontaneous order and the microscopic symmetries of the underlying lattice. Here, we propose the topological substratum on which Ising spin lattices exhibit long-range order when cooled under non-ergodic conditions. Our topological decomposition, tantamount to resonating sand plates, enables monitoring and control of the dynamical evolution in systems surfing complex energy landscapes with multiple metastable patterns.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian Motion with Negative Hurst Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. Here we extend this definition to the strongly anti-persistent regime $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The extended fBm turns out to be stationary, and we derive its autocorrelation function. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also determine the variance of a closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.</description>

      <title>Finite-size scaling of percolation on scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical phenomena on scale-free networks with a degree distribution $p_k \sim k^{-\lambda}$ exhibit rich finite-size effects due to its structural heterogeneity. We systematically study the finite-size scaling of percolation and identify two distinct crossover routes to mean-field behavior: one controlled by the degree exponent $\lambda$, the other by the degree cutoff $K \sim V^{\kappa}$, where $V$ is the system size and $\kappa \in [0,1]$ is the cutoff exponent. Increasing $\lambda$ or decreasing $\kappa$ suppresses heterogeneity and drives the system toward mean-field behavior, with logarithmic corrections near the marginal case. These findings provide a unified picture of the crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous criticality. In the crossover regime, we observe rich finite-size phenomena, including the transition from vanishing to divergent susceptibility, distinct exponents for the shift and fluctuation of pseudocritical points, and a numerical clarification of previous theoretical debates.</description>

      <title>Liquid-Gas Criticality of Hyperuniform Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical physics, a well-accepted knowledge is that liquid-gas (LG) phase transition with diverging critical fluctuations lies in the universality class of Ising model. Yet, whether non-equilibrium effect alone can alter this conclusion remains an open question. Here, we study the LG criticality of a hyperuniform (HU) fluid composed of active spinners, where phase separation is induced by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the LG critical point, the HU fluid exhibits normal Gaussian density fluctuations instead of the diverging fluctuations. Through hydrodynamic field theory and renormalization-group analysis, we demonstrate that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension from d_c = 4 (classical fluids) to d_c = 2 due to an emerging long-range correlation induced by center-of-mass conservation. Large-scale stochastic field simulations confirm this dimensional reduction, and reveal diverging response function along with anomalous zero-range correlation function at the critical point, indicating the absence of an effective fluctuation-dissipation relationship in the system. The simulation also identifies anomalous finite-size scaling in density fluctuation, energy fluctuation, and Binder cumulant. Furthermore, HU fluid also exihibits non-classical spinodal decomposition dynamics with diverging decomposition time but non-diverging decomposition length scale. Our results provide an exception to the classical paradigms of LG critical phenomena and highlight how non-equilibrium effect can reshape universality classes of classical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>New universality classes govern the critical and multicritical behavior of an active Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ising model is one of the most well known models in statistical physics, with its critical behavior governed by the Wilson-Fisher universality class (UC). When active motility is incorporated into the Ising model by, e.g., dictating that the spins' directional movements follow their orientations, the spin number density necessarily constitutes a soft mode in the hydrodynamic description, and can therefore modify the scaling behavior of the system. Here, we show that this is indeed the case in a critical active Ising model in which density can impede the system's collective motion. Specifically, we use a perturbative dynamic renormalization group method to the one-loop level to uncover three new UCs, one of which supersedes the Wilson-Fisher UC to become the generic UC that governs the critical behavior of the active Ising model.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.</description>

Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Dissipative response of driven bead-spring-dashpot chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work dissipated in pulling a polymer chain with internal friction is numerically calculated by considering a sequence of $N$ bead-spring-dashpots tethered at one end and being pulled at the other using a harmonic trap via linear and symmetric protocols. The variation of the dissipation with the chain length, pulling trap stiffness, and the internal friction parameter are examined in detail for both the protocols. In the limit of high trap stiffness: (i) the dissipation $decreases$ with $N$ for chains with internal friction, keeping all other parameters constant, and (ii) the relationship between the dissipation and internal friction parameter deviates from linearity as $N$ is increased. Consequently, a closed-form expression between the dissipated work in driving a chain of spring-dashpots and the damping coefficient of a single dashpot can be written only for the case of $N = 1$ [as shown in Phys. Rev. Res. $\mathbf{2}$, 013331 (2020)] and not for the general case of $N &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamical scaling in the inviscid limit of 3D stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with thermal noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectrally truncated three-dimensional (3D) Euler flows reach an absolute equilibrium. Yet they show non-trivial temporal correlations, similar to the ones of turbulent flows. In this work, we investigate Navier-Stokes equation in equilibrium conditions, both at finite viscosity and in the inviscid limit. We determine the space-time velocity correlations, using functional renormalisation group and direct numerical simulations. We characterise the crossover in the dynamical scaling from $\tau\sim 1/(\nu k^2)$ at finite viscosity to $\tau\sim 1/(u_{\rm rms}k)$ in the inviscid limit, where $\tau$ is the decorrelation time. We show that, although the static properties of spectrally truncated Euler flows radically differ from their hydrodynamical limit, they share a similar emergent $k^{-1}$ dynamical scaling.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Turbulence via an Instanton Gas Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling synthetic turbulent fields as a computationally tractable surrogate for direct numerical simulations (DNS) is an important practical problem in various applications, and allows to test our physical understanding of the main features of real turbulent flows. Reproducing higher-order Eulerian correlation functions, as well as Lagrangian particle statistics, requires an accurate representation of coherent structures of the flow in the synthetic turbulent fields. To this end, we propose in this paper a systematic coherent-structure based method for sampling synthetic random fields, based on a superposition of instanton configurations - an instanton gas - from the field-theoretic formulation of turbulence. We discuss sampling strategies for ensembles of instantons, both with and without interactions and including Gaussian fluctuations around them. The resulting Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics are evaluated numerically and compared against DNS results, as well as Gaussian and log-normal cascade models that lack coherent structures. The instanton gas approach is illustrated via the example of one-dimensional Burgers turbulence throughout this paper, and we show that already a canonical ensemble of non-interacting instantons without fluctuations reproduces DNS statistics very well. Finally, we outline extensions of the method to higher dimensions, in particular to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence for future applications to cosmic ray propagation.</description>

      <title>Spin-Based Modeling of Perception as Emergent from contextualized Internal Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic model of perception of an interoceptive sensation in which spin-like variables encode an organism's internal evaluation of embodied vital norms associated with the sensation. Spins can take positive, negative, or neutral values. These local valorizations interact on a lattice embedded in the environmental context, and their collective configuration gives rise to a macroscopic perceptual state. By applying a coarse-graining procedure to a family of symmetric spin models, we derive a macroscopic Landau-type functional that makes explicit the mechanism by which key phenomenological features of perception, emerge from microscopic evaluative interactions. A central result is that the inclusion of a neutral evaluative state fundamentally alters the structure of the perceptual landscape, enhancing entropy, lowering the critical threshold, and increasing sensitivity to contextual input. These results establish a principled link between microscopic evaluative processes and large-scale perceptual organization, offering a flexible framework for integrating perceptual regulation and neurobiological modeling. The model integrates notions of neuroscience and cognitive science using the formalism of condensed matter field theory and providing novel theoretical insights and experimental predictions for conditions such as mental disorders and chronic pain.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and structural properties of an absorbing phase transition: a case study from granular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical and structural properties of absorbing phase transitions (APTs) within granular systems. Specifically, we examine a model for vibrofluidized systems of spherical grains, which transition from a state of pure vertical motion to a horizontal diffusive state upon increased density. Depending on the details of the system, we observe both continuous and discontinuous transitions in numerical simulations. We explain this using a theoretical analysis based on kinetic theory applied to a coarse-grained model, which elucidates the role of a synchronization effect in determining the nature of the transition. A fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, which quantitatively describes the structural and dynamical properties of the active state such as hyperuniformity is derived from the microscopic dynamics, together with an equilibrium-like assumption concerning the noises on the hydrodynamic fields. This work expands on previous studies by providing a comprehensive examination of the APT characteristics and proposing new theoretical models to interpret the observed behaviors.</description>

Abstract: Cesium lead halide nanocrystals and quantum dots are prominent materials for different types of applications because of their remarkable photophysical properties. However, they are also known to exhibit the same effects observed for non-perovskite colloidal semiconductor quantum dots such as blinking, photobleaching, delayed luminescence, etc. In this study we reveal the correlations between fast and delayed emission components for both the intensity and characteristic decay time for single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals. In order to explain the phenomena observed, we propose a novel model of single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals luminescence blinking based on the hypothesis of slow variations in the electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Bridging Machine Learning and Glassy Dynamics Theory for Predictive Polymer Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Scale locality of information flow in shell models of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for shell models. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, by assuming the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the Kolmogorov multiplier, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.</description>

      <title>The transition from homeostasis to stochasticity induced catastrophe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the transition from homeostasis to stochasticity driven breakdown in an experimentally motivated minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.</description>

      <title>Emergent facilitation by random constraints in a facilitated random walk model of glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of glass has been a significant topic of interest for decades. Dynamical facilitation is widely believed to be an important characteristic of glassy dynamics, but the precise mechanism is still under debate. We propose a lattice model of glass called the facilitated random walk (FRW). Each particle performs continuous time random walk in the presence of its own random local kinetic constraints. The particles do not interact energetically. Instead, they interact kinetically with a hopping rate resampling rule under which motions of a particle can randomly perturb the local kinetic constraints of other particles. This dynamic interaction is reversible, following a rate restoration rule. A step-by-step reversal of the particle motions exactly restore the previous constraints, modeling randomness quenched in the configuration space of glass. The model exhibits stretched exponential relaxation and dynamical heterogeneity typical of glasses. Despite the lack of explicit facilitation rule, the FRW shows facilitation behaviors closely analogous to those of the kinetically constrained models (KCM). The FRW is a coarse-grained version of the distinguishable particle lattice model (DPLM) and this exemplifies that compatible defect and atomistic models can complement each other on the study of glass.</description>

Abstract: Since the advent of quantum mechanics, classical probability interpretations have faced significant challenges. A notable issue arises with the emergence of negative probabilities when attempting to define the joint probability of non-commutative observables. In this work, we propose a resolution to this dilemma for quantum spin chains, by introducing an exact representation of their dynamics in terms of classical continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). These CTMCs effectively model the creation, annihilation, and propagation of pairs of classical particles and antiparticles. The quantum dynamics then emerges by averaging over various realizations of this classical process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-state Togashi-Kaneko model demonstrates how, at finite system sizes, autocatalysis can lead to noise-induced bistability between the cellular concentrations of different molecular species. Here, we show that, in the biologically relevant scenario of species-dependent export rates, the nascent stochastic switching between molecular species also drives a concomitant switching between periods of growth or decay in the total population size. We demonstrate this behavior using stochastic simulations as well as the numerical integration of a Fokker-Planck equation that approximates the finite system-size limit. By combining piecewise-deterministic-Markov and linear-noise approximations, we further find analytic expressions for the stationary distributions of the different molecular species when stochastic switching is faster than the dynamics in the total population size. We envisage that other models in the voter class -- including spin systems, flocking and opinion dynamics -- may also exhibit aperiodic growth and decay in population size, as well as be amenable to similar techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general one-dimensional overdamped diffusion model described by the It\^{o} stochastic differential equation (SDE) ${dX_t=\mu(X_t,t)dt+\sigma(X_t,t)dW_t}$, where $W_t$ is the standard Wiener process. We obtain a specific condition that $\mu$ and $\sigma$ must fulfil in order to be able to solve the SDE via mapping the generic process, using a suitable space-time transformation, onto the simpler Wiener process. By taking advantage of this transformation, we obtain the propagator in the case of open, reflecting, and absorbing \emph{time-dependent\/} boundary conditions for a large class of diffusion processes. In particular, this allows us to derive the first-passage time statistics of such a large class of models, some of which were so far unknown. While our results are valid for a wide range of non-autonomous, non-linear and non-homogeneous processes, we illustrate applications in stochastic thermodynamics by focusing on the propagator and first-passage-time statistics of isoentropic processes that were previously realized in the laboratory with Brownian particles trapped with optical tweezers.</description>

Abstract: We study the full distribution $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ of sums $A = \sum_{i=1}^N$ where $x_1, \dots, x_N$ are $N \gg 1$ independent and identically distributed random variables each sampled from a given distribution $p(x)$ with a subexponential $x \to \infty$ tail. We consider two particular cases: (I) the one-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-x^\alpha}$ where $0 &lt; x &lt; \infty$, (II) the two-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-|x|^\alpha}$ where $-\infty &lt; x &lt; \infty$. We assume $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ (in both cases). As follows immediately from known theorems, for both cases (i) typical fluctuations of $\Delta A = A - \left\langle A\right\rangle $ are described by the central-limit theorem, (ii) the tail $A \to \infty$ is described by the big-jump principle $P_{N}\left(A\right) \simeq N p\left(A\right)$, and (iii) in between these two regimes there is a nontrivial intermediate regime which displays anomalous scaling $P_{N}\left(A\right) \sim e^{-N^\beta f(\Delta A/N^\gamma)}$ with anomalous exponents $\beta,\gamma \in (0,1)$ and large-deviation function $f(y)$ that are all exactly known. In practice, although these theoretical predictions of $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ work very well in regimes (i) and (ii), they often perform quite poorly in the intermediate regime (ii), with errors of several orders of magnitude for $N$ as large as $10^4$. We calculate subleading order corrections to the theoretical predictions in the intermediate regime. We find that for $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \alpha_c$, these corrections scale as power laws in $N$, while for $\alpha_c &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ they scale as stretched exponentials, where the threshold value is $\alpha_c = 1/2$ in case (I) and $\alpha_c = 2/3$ in case (II). This difference between the two cases is a result of the mirror symmetry $p(x) = p(-x)$ which holds only in the latter case.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Theory of Increasing Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12585v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An influential theory of increasing returns has been proposed by the economist W. B. Arthur in the '80s to explain the lock-in phenomenon between two competing commercial products. In the most simplified situation there are two competing products that gain customers according to a majority mechanism: each new customer arrives and asks which product they bought to a certain odd number of previous customers, and then buy the most shared product within this sample. It is known that one of these two companies reaches monopoly almost surely in the limit of infinite customers. Here we consider a generalization [G. Dosi, Y. Ermoliev, Y. Kaniovsky, J. Math. Econom. 23, 1-19 (1994)] where the new customer follows the indication of the sample with some probability, and buy the other product otherwise. Other than economy, this model can be reduced to the urn of Hill, Lane and Sudderth, and includes several models of physical interest as special cases, like the Elephant Random Walk, the Friedman's urn and other generalized urn models. We provide a large deviation analysis of this model at the sample-path level, and give a formula that allows to find the most likely trajectories followed by the market share variable. Interestingly, in the parameter range where the lock-in phase is expected, we observe a whole region of convergence where the entropy cost is sub-linear. We also find a non-linear differential equation for the cumulant generating function of the market share variable, that can be studied with a suitable perturbations theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06318v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mott's variable range hopping (v.r.h.) is the phonon-induced hopping of electrons in disordered solids (such as doped semiconductors) within the regime of strong Anderson localization. It was introduced by N.~Mott to explain the anomalous low temperature conductivity decay in dimension $d\geq 2$, corresponding now to the so called Mott's law. We provide a rigorous derivation of this Physics law for two effective models of Mott v.r.h.: the random resistor network for v.r.h. of \cite[Section~IV]{AHL} and Mott's random walk. We also determine the constant multiplying the power of the inverse temperature in the exponent in Mott's law, which was an open problem also on a heuristic level.</description>

      <title>Universal thermalization dynamics in (1+1)d QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify the universal mechanism behind the thermalization of (1+1)d QFTs at high and low temperatures. Viewing these theories as CFTs perturbed by relevant or irrelevant deformations, we show that conformal perturbation theory in the thermal state breaks down at late times allowing for the emergence of hydrodynamics. This breakdown occurs universally due to the unsuppressed exchange of stress tensors near the lightcone. Furthermore, for theories with central charge $c\rightarrow\infty$ we solve for the emergent hydrodynamic theory to all orders in the gradient expansion by arguing that all transport parameters appearing in two-point functions have universal expressions in terms of the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the perturbation. The radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic dispersion relations provides an early time cutoff for hydrodynamics, which agrees with the time scale at which conformal perturbation theory breaks down.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of realizing the Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules and degenerate Fermi molecules in three dimensions relies crucially on the microwave shielding technique, which strongly suppresses the collision loss between molecules. In this letter, we show that the cooperation of microwave shielding and dipolar interaction naturally leads to the emergence of a synthetic gauge field. Unlike that studied in cold atoms before, this gauge field couples to the relative motion of every two molecules instead of single-particle motion, therefore being a mutual gauge field. In this case, every molecule carrying a synthetic charge sees the other molecule as carrying the source of the magnetic field, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is reminiscent of a solenoid attached to the molecule. In other words, in addition to microwave-shielded interaction, another part of the interaction between two molecules behaves as a charge interacting with a solenoid, which was missed in the previous discussion. We argue that the physical manifestation of this gauge field is breaking time-reversal symmetry in the collective spatial motion of molecules. Finally, we discuss the challenges in quantitatively studying such a quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium coexistence between a fluid and a hotter or colder crystal of granular hard disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase.
  Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model for broad range of strongly correlated phases, particularly the high-Tc superconductor. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</description>

      <title>Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design an enhanced Event-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to study 1D quantum dissipative systems, using their bosonized representation. Expressing the bosonized Hamiltonian as a path integral over a scalar field enables the application of Monte Carlo algorithms developed for classical systems. Specifically, we focus on a dissipative XXZ spin chain, exhibiting critical slowing down, minima degeneracy and long-range interactions. Addressing all three bottlenecks, we design an algorithm that combines local persistent Event-Chain Monte Carlo moves with global cluster moves, in a O(1)-complexity implementation. Through systematic performance analysis, we show that such an algorithm outperforms traditional Metropolis algorithms by more than a magnitude factor and is competitive with current state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. We then use this approach to determine the dissipative spin chain's phase diagram, thereby reinforcing prior analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Minimal mechanism for flocking in phoretically interacting active colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Finding possible mechanisms of attaining a global polar order via dynamical mechanisms - without any explicit alignment interaction - is an area of active current research. We report a novel flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the polar liquid flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques. The mechanism we report requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. This can be equivalently interpreted as pair colloids sliding a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating due to chemical interactions. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. We complement these results with an analysis of a continuum hydrodynamic model, with the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state. Finally, we present simulations for flocking in an agent-based model consisting of local update rules of colloidal pairs that slide and rotate upon collision.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: II. Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.</description>

      <title>Beyond one-loop: higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} &lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f &gt; N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</description>
