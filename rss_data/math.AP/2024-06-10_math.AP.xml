      <title>Smooth nonradial stationary Euler flows on the plane with compact support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of nonradial classical solutions to the 2D incompressible Euler equations with compact support. More precisely, for any positive integer $k$, we construct compactly supported stationary Euler flows of class $C^k(\mathbb{R}^2)$ which are not locally radial. The proof uses a degree-theory-based bifurcation argument which hinges on three key ingredients: a novel approach to stationary Euler flows through elliptic equations with non-autonomous nonlinearities; a set of sharp regularity estimates for the linearized operator, which involves a potential that blows up as the inverse square of the distance to the boundary of the support; and overcoming a serious problem of loss of derivatives by the introduction of anisotropic weighted functional spaces between which the linearized operator is Fredholm.</description>

      <title>Collapsing-ring blowup solutions for the nonlinear heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a singular standing ring solution of the nonlinear heat in the radial case. We give rigorous proof for the existence of a ring blow-up solution in finite time. This result was predicted formally by Baruch, Fibich and Gavish \cite{BFGpd10}. We also prove the stability of these dynamics among radially symmetric solutions.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger semigroups and the H\"ormander hypoellipticity condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of (possibly) degenerate dispersive equations with a drift. We prove that, under the H\"ormander hypoellipticity condition, the relevant Cauchy problem can be uniquely solved in the Schwartz class, and the solution operator can be uniquely extended to a strongly continuous semigroup $\{\mathcal T(t)\}_{t\ge 0}$ in $L^2(\Rm)$. Finally, we prove that for $t&gt;0$ the operator $\mathcal T(t)$ satisfies a sharp form of dispersive estimate in $L^p$, for any $1\le p\le 2$, and an uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Chaotic motion and singularity structures of front solutions in multi-component FitzHugh-Nagumo-type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of front solutions in a certain class of multi-component reaction-diffusion systems, where one fast component governed by an Allen-Cahn equation is weakly coupled to a system of $N$ linear slow reaction-diffusion equations. By using geometric singular perturbation theory, Evans function analysis and center manifold reduction, we demonstrate that and how the complexity of the front motion can be controlled by the choice of coupling function and the dimension $N$ of the slow part of the multi-component reaction-diffusion system. On the one hand, we show how to imprint and unfold a given scalar singularity structure. On the other hand, for $N\geq 3$ we show how chaotic behaviour of the front speed arises from the unfolding of a nilpotent singularity via the breaking of a Shil'nikov homoclinic orbit. The rigorous analysis is complemented by a numerical study that is heavily guided by our analytic findings.</description>

      <title>Density estimates and the fractional Sobolev inequality for sets of zero $s$-mean curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that measurable sets $E\subset \mathbb R^n$ with locally finite perimeter and zero $s$-mean curvature satisfy the surface density estimates: \begin{align*}
  \operatorname{Per} (E; B_R(x)) \geq CR^{n-1} \end{align*} for all $R&gt;0$, $x\in \partial^\ast E$. The $C$ depends only on $n$ and $s$, and remains bounded as $s\to 1^-$. As an application, we prove that the fractional Sobolev inequality holds on the boundary of sets with zero $s$-mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Front propagation through a perforated wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bistable reaction-diffusion equation $u_t=\Delta u +f(u)$ on $\mathbb{R}^N$ in the presence of an obstacle $K$, which is a wall of infinite span with many holes. More precisely, $K$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ with smooth boundary such that its projection onto the $x_1$-axis is bounded and that $\mathbb{R}^N \setminus K$ is connected. Our goal is to study what happens when a planar traveling front coming from $x_1 = -\infty$ meets the wall $K$.We first show that there is clear dichotomy between "propagation" and "blocking".  In other words, the traveling front either passes through the wall and propagates toward $x_1=+\infty$ (propagation) or is trapped around the wall (blocking), and that there is no intermediate behavior. This dichotomy holds for any type of walls of finite thickness. Next we discuss sufficient conditions for blocking and propagation. For blocking, assuming either that $K$ is periodic in $y:=(x_2,\ldots, x_N)$ or that the holes are localized within a bounded area, we show that blocking occurs if the holes are sufficiently narrow. For propagation, three different types of sufficient conditions for propagation will be presented, namely "walls with large holes", "small-capacity walls", and "parallel-blade walls". We also discuss complete and incomplete invasions.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limit of non-exchangeable multi-agent systems over hypergraphs with unbounded rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems are known for their ability to generate large-scale self-organized structures from simple local interaction rules between each agent and its neighbors. In addition to studying their emergent behavior, a main focus of the mathematical community has been concentrated on deriving their large-population limit. In particular, the mean-field limit consists of describing the limit system by its population density in the product space of positions and labels. The strategy to derive such limits is often based on a careful combination of methods ranging from analysis of PDEs and stochastic analysis, to kinetic equations and graph theory. In this article, we focus on a generalization of multi-agent systems that includes higher-order interactions, which has largely captured the attention of the applied community in the last years. In such models, interactions between individuals are no longer assumed to be binary ({\it i.e.} between a pair of particles). Instead, individuals are allowed to interact by groups so that a full group jointly generates a non-linear force on any given individual. The underlying graph of connections is  then replaced by a hypergraph, which we assume to be dense, but possibly non uniform and of unbounded rank. For the first time in the literature, we show that when the interaction kernels are regular enough,  then the mean-field limit is determined by a limiting Vlasov-type equation, where the hypergraph limit is encoded by a so-called UR-hypergraphon (unbounded-rank hypergraphon), and where the resulting mean-field force admits infinitely-many orders of interactions.</description>

      <title>Zero Viscosity Limit of Steady Compressible Shear Flow with Navier-Slip Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and the zero viscosity limit of steady compressible shear flow with Navier-slip boundary condition in the absence of any external force in a two-dimension domain $\Omega=(0,L)\times(0,2)$. More precisely, under the assumption that the Mach number $\eta&lt;\va^{\f12+}$ and $L\ll1$, we prove the existence of smooth solutions to steady compressible Naiver-Stokes equations near plane Poiseuille-Couette flow as well as the convergence of the solutions obtained above to the solutions of steady incompressible Euler equations when the viscous $\va$ tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for the one-dimensional Boussinesq-Peregrine system under small bottom variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boussinesq-Peregrine system is derived from the water waves system in presence of topographic variation under the hypothesis of shallowness and small amplitude regime. The system becomes significantly simpler (at least in the mathematical sens) under the hypothesis of small topographic variation. In this work we study the long time and global well-posedness of the Boussinesq-Peregrine system. We start by showing the intermediate time well-posedness in the case of general topography (i.e. the amplitude of the bottom graph $\beta=O(1)$). The novelty resides in the functional setting, $H^s({\mathbb R}), \, s&gt; \frac {1} {2}$. Then we show our main result establishing that the global existence result obtained in Molinet-Talhouk-Zaiter in the flat bottom case is still valid for the Boussinesq-Peregrine system under the hypothesis of small amplitude bottom variation (i.e. $\beta =O(\mu)$). More precisely we prove that this system is unconditionally globally well-posed in the Sobolev spaces of type $ H^s ({\mathbb R}), \, s&gt; \frac {1} {2}$. Finally, we show the existence of a weak global solution in the Schonbek sense, i.e. existence of low regularity entropic solutions of the small bottom amplitude Boussinesq-Pelegrine equations emanating from $ u_0 \in H^1 $ and $ \zeta_0 $ in an Orlicz class as weak limits of regular solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the global well-posedness and optimal decay estimates to the Oldroyd-B model in $\mathbb R^d$ ($d\geq2$). By utilizing the special structure of this system, we give a simplified proof to the global existence of solutions for the case of initial data small in critical Besov spaces and non-small coupling parameters. Moreover, the optimal decay rates of the solutions under minimal small assumption on the initial data are established by fully making use of the effect of velocity dissipation and damping mechanism.</description>

      <title>Uniform estimates for a family of Poisson problems: `rounding up the corners'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove \emph{uniform solvability estimates} for certain families of elliptic problems posed in a family of domains that converge to another domain. We provide uniform estimates both in weighted and in usual Sobolev spaces. When the limit domain is a \emph{polygon}, our results amount to ``rounding up'' the corners of the limit domain. The technique of proof is based on a suitable conformal modification of the metric, which makes the union of the domains a manifold with boundary and relative bounded geometry.</description>

      <title>On location of maximal gradient of torsion function over some non-symmetric planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the location of the maximal gradient of the torsion function on some non-symmetric planar domains. First, for triangles, by reflection method, we show that the maximal gradient of the torsion function always occurs on the longest sides, lying between the foot of the altitude and the middle point. Moreover, via nodal line analysis and continuity method, we demonstrate that restricted on each side, the critical point of gradient of the torsion function is unique and nondegenerate. Second, by establishing uniform estimates for narrow domains, we prove that as a planar domain bounded by two graphs of function becomes increasingly narrow, the location of maximal gradient of its torsion tends toward the endpoint of the longest vertical line segment, with smaller curvature among them. This shows that Saint-Venant's conjecture on location of fail points is valid for asymptotically narrow domains. Third, using the reflection method, we prove that for a non-concentric annulus, maximal gradient of torsion always occurs at the point on the inner ring closest to the center of the outer ring.</description>

      <title>Linearization and Homogenization of nonlinear elasticity close to stress-free joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a hyperelastic composite material with a periodic microstructure and a prestrain close to a stress-free joint. We consider two limits associated with linearization and homogenization. Unlike previous studies that focus on composites with a stress-free reference configuration, the minimizers of the elastic energy functional in the prestrained case are not explicitly known. Consequently, it is initially unclear at which deformation to perform the linearization. Our main result shows that both the consecutive and simultaneous limits converge to a single homogenized model of linearized elasticity. This model features a homogenized prestrain and provides first-order information about the minimizers of the original nonlinear model. We find that the homogenization of the material and the homogenization of the prestrain are generally coupled and cannot be considered separately. Additionally, we establish an asymptotic quadratic expansion of the homogenized stored energy function and present a detailed analysis of the effective model for laminate composite materials. A key analytical contribution of our paper is a new mixed-growth version of the geometric rigidity estimate for Jones domains. The proof of this result relies on the construction of an extension operator for Jones domains adapted to geometric rigidity.</description>

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the construction of multidimensional spherical monogenics. Firstly, we investigate the construction of monogenic functions in dimension $3$ by applying the Dirac operator to the orthonormal bases of spherical harmonics, resulting in orthogonal spherical monogenics. Additionally, we employ the reproducing kernel for monogenic functions and a specialized optimization method to derive various types of $3$-dimensional spherical harmonics and spherical monogenics.</description>

      <title>The free boundary problem of an epidemic model with nonlocal diffusions and nonlocal reactions: spreading-vanishing dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04880v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the free boundary problem of an epidemic model. The spatial movements of the infectious agents and the infective humans are approximated by nonlocal diffusion operators. Especially, both the growth rate of the agents and the infective rate of humans are represented by nonlocal reaction terms. Thus our model has four integral terms which bring some diffculties for the study of the corresponding principal eigenvalue problem. Firstly, using some elementray analysis instead of Krein-Rutman theorem and the variational characteristic, we obtain the existence and asymptotic behaviors of principal eigenvalue. Then a spreading-vanishing dichotomy is proved to hold, and the criteria for spreading and vanishing are derived. Lastly, comparing our results with those in the existing works, we discuss the effect of nonlocal reaction term on spreading and vanishing, finding that the more nonlocal reaction terms a model has, the harder spreading happens.</description>

      <title>Linear stability analysis for a system of singular amplitude equations arising in biomorphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear stability of exponential periodic solutions of a system of singular amplitude equations associated with convective Turing bifurcation in the presence of conservation laws, as arises in modern biomorphology models, binary fluids, and elsewhere. Consisting of a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation coupled with a singular convection-diffusion equation in "mean modes" associated with conservation laws, these were shown previously by the authors to admit a constant-coefficient linearized stability analysis as in the classical Ginzburg-Landau case -- albeit now singular in wave amplitude epsilon -- yielding useful necessary conditions for stability, both of the exponential functions as solutions of the amplitude equations, and of the associated periodic pattern solving the underlying PDE. Here, we show by a delicate two-parameter matrix perturbation analysis that (strict) satisfaction of these necessary conditions is also sufficient for diffusive stability in the sense of Schneider, yielding a corresponding result, and nonlinear stability, for the underlying PDE. Moreover, we show that they may be interpreted as stability along a non-normally hyperbolic slow manifold approximated by Darcy-type reduction, together with attraction along transverse mean modes, connecting with finite-time approximation theorems of Hacker-Schneider-Zimmerman.</description>

      <title>New results on biorthogonal families in cylindrical domains and controllability consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider moment problems equivalent to null controllability of some linear parabolic partial differential equations in space dimension higher than one. For these moment problems, we prove existence of an associated biorthogonal family and estimate its norm. The considered setting requires the space domain to be a cylinder and the evolution operator to be tensorized. Roughly speaking, we assume that the so-called Lebeau-Robbiano spectral inequality holds but only for the eigenvectors of the transverse operator. In the one dimensional tangent variable we assume the solvability of block moment problem as introduced in [Benabdallah, Boyer and Morancey - \textit{Ann. H. Lebesgue.} 3 (2020)]. We apply this abstract construction of biorthogonal families to the characterization of the minimal time for simultaneous null controllability of two heat-like equations in a cylindrical domain. To the best of our knowledge, this result is unattainable with other known techniques.</description>

      <title>Kru\v{z}kov-type uniqueness theorem for the chemical flood conservation law system with local vanishing viscosity admissibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the uniqueness of solutions of the initial-boundary value problem in the quarter-plane for the chemical flood conservation law system in the class of piece-wise $\mathcal C^1$-smooth functions under certain restrictions. The vanishing viscosity method is used locally on the discontinuities of the solution to determine admissible and inadmissible shocks. The Lagrange coordinate transformation is utilized in order to split the equations. The proof of uniqueness is based on an entropy inequality similar to the one used in the classical Kru\v{z}kov's theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the limit behavior of the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow as its cone angle tends to zero. More precisely, we prove that as the cone angle tends to zero, the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow converges to a unique K\"ahler-Ricci flow, which is smooth outside the divisor and admits cusp singularity along the divisor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the stability of the generalized Lagrangian mean curvature flow of graph case in the cotangent bundle, which is first defined by Smoczyk-Tsui-Wang. By new estimates of derivatives along the flow, we weaken the initial condition and remove the positive curvature condition in Smoczyk-Tsui-Wang's work. More precisely, we prove that if the graph induced by a closed $1$-form is a special Lagrangian submanifold in the cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold, then the generalized Lagrangian mean curvature flow is stable near it.</description>

      <title>Quantitative instability for stochastic scalar reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the instability of stochastic scalar reaction diffusion equations, driven by a multiplicative noise that is white in time and smooth in space, near to zero, which is assumed to be a fixed point for the equation. We prove that if the Lyapunov exponent at zero is positive, then the flow of non-zero solutions admits uniform bounds on small negative moments. The proof builds on ideas from stochastic homogenisation. We require suitable corrector estimates for the solution to a Poisson problem involving an infinite-dimensional projective process, together with a linearisation step that hinges on quantitative parametrix-like arguments. Overall, we are able to construct an appropriate Lyapunov functional for the nonlinear dynamics and address some problems left open in the literature.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear parabolic forward-backward problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the well-posedness of several linear and nonlinear equations with a parabolic forward-backward structure, and to highlight the similarities and differences between them.
  The epitomal linear example will be the stationary Kolmogorov equation $yu_x -u_{yy}=f$, which we investigate in a rectangle, supplemented with boundary conditions on the "parabolic boundary" of the domain. We first prove that this equation admits a finite number of singular solutions associated with regular data. These singular solutions, of which we provide an explicit construction, are localized in the vicinity of two points. Hence, the solutions to the Kolmogorov equation associated with a smooth source term $f$ are regular if and only if $f$ satisfies a finite number of orthogonality conditions. This is similar to well-known phenomena in elliptic problems in polygonal domains.
  We then extend this theory to a Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck system, and to two quasilinear equations: the Burgers type equation $u u_x - u_{yy} = f$ in the vicinity of the linear shear flow, and the Prandtl system in the vicinity of a recirculating solution, close to the line where the horizontal velocity changes sign. We therefore revisit part of a recent work by Iyer and Masmoudi. For the two latter quasilinear equations, we introduce a geometric change of variables which changes the quasilinear system into a semilinear one. In these new variables, the linear differential operator is very close to the Kolmogorov one. Stepping on the linear theory, we prove existence and uniqueness of regular solutions for data within a manifold of finite codimension, corresponding to some nonlinear orthogonality conditions.</description>

      <title>Bounded solutions for non-parametric mean curvature problems with nonlinear terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove existence of nonnegative bounded solutions for the non-autonomous prescribed mean curvature problem in non-parametric form on an open bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^N$. The mean curvature, that depends on the location of the solution $u$ itself, is asked to be of the form $f(x)h(u)$, where $f$ is a nonnegative function in $L^{N,\infty}(\Omega)$ and $h:\mathbb{R}^+\mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$ is merely continuous and possibly unbounded near zero. As a preparatory tool for our analysis we propose a purely PDE approach to the prescribed mean curvature problem not depending on the solution, i.e. $h\equiv 1$. This part, which has its own independent interest, aims to represent a modern and up-to-date account on the subject. Uniqueness is also handled in presence of a decreasing nonlinearity. The sharpness of the results is highlighted by mean of explicit examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a sufficient condition under which solutions to the 3D forced Navier--Stokes equations satisfy an $L^p$-in-time version of the Kolmogorov 4/5 law for the behavior of the averaged third order longitudinal structure function along the vanishing viscosity limit. The result has a natural probabilistic interpretation: the predicted behavior is observed on average after waiting for some sufficiently generic random time. The sufficient condition is satisfied e.g. by the solutions constructed by Bru\`e, Colombo, Crippa, De~Lellis, and Sorella. In this particular case, our results can be applied to derive a bound for the exponent of the third order absolute structure function in accordance with the Kolmogorov turbulence theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper concerns about the uniform decaying property (abbreviated by UDP) of solutions for an anisotropic viscoelastic system in the form of integrodifferential system (abbreviated by VID system) with mixed type boundary condition. The mixed type condition consists of the homogeneous displacement boundary condition and a homogeneous traction boundary condition or with a dissipation. By using a dissipative structure of this system, we will prove the UDP in a unified way for the two cases, which are, when the time derivative of relaxation tensor decays with polynomial order and it decays with exponential order.</description>

      <title>The Method of Moving Spheres on the Hyperbolic Space and the Classification of Solutions and the prescribed Q-curvature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of solutions to semilinear partial differential equations, as well as the classification of critical points of the corresponding functionals, have wide applications in the study of partial differential equations and differential geometry. The classical moving plane method and the method of moving sphere on the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ provide an effective approach to capture the symmetry of solutions. As far as we know, the moving sphere method has yet to be developed on the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$. In the present paper, we focus on the following equation \begin{equation*}
  P_k u = f(u) \end{equation*} on hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^n$, where $P_k$ denotes the GJMS operators on $\mathbb{H}^n$ and $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies certain growth conditions. We develop a moving sphere approach on $\mathbb{H}^n$ to obtain the symmetry propertyas well as the classification of positive solutions to the above equation. Our methods also rely on the Helgason-Fourier analysis and Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities on hyperbolic space together with a Kelvin transform we introduce on the hyperbolic space in this paper. We also present applications to the higher order prescribed $Q$-curvature problem on the hyperbolic space.</description>

We prove existence and uniqueness of continuous solutions if the initial conditions are continuous. We discuss several qualitative and quantitative properties of the solutions.

      <title>An FIO-based approach to $L^p$-bounds for the wave equation on $2$-step Carnot groups: the case of M\'etivier groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a homogeneous left-invariant sub-Laplacian on a $2$-step Carnot group. We devise a new geometric approach to sharp fixed-time $L^p$-bounds with loss of derivatives for the wave equation driven by $\mathcal{L}$, based on microlocal analysis and highlighting the role of the underlying sub-Riemannian geodesic flow. A major challenge here stems from the fact that, differently from the Riemannian case, the conjugate locus of a point on a sub-Riemannian manifold may cluster at the point itself, thus making it indispensable to deal with caustics even when studying small-time wave propagation.
  Our analysis of the wave propagator on a $2$-step Carnot group allows us to reduce microlocally to two conic regions in frequency space: an anti-FIO region, which seems not amenable to FIO techniques, and an FIO region. For the latter, we construct a parametrix by means of FIOs with complex phase, by adapting a construction from the elliptic setting due to Laptev, Safarov and Vassiliev, which remains valid beyond caustics. A substantial problem arising here is that, after a natural decomposition and scalings, one must deal with the long-time behaviour and control of $L^1$-norms of the corresponding contributions to the wave propagator, a new phenomenon that is specific to sub-elliptic settings.
  For the class of M\'etivier groups, we show how our approach, in combination with a variation of the key method of Seeger, Sogge and Stein for proving $L^p$-estimates for FIOs, yields $L^p$-bounds for the wave equation, which are sharp up to the endpoint regularity. In particular, we extend previously known results for distinguished sub-Laplacians on groups of Heisenberg type, by means of a more general and robust approach. The study of the wave equation on wider classes of $2$-step Carnot groups via this approach will pose further challenges that we plan to address in subsequent works.</description>

Abstract: We derive the renormalised equation for the quasi-generalised KPZ equation with space-time white noise. We complement the program initiated by Gerencs\'er and Hairer for solving quasi-linear equations using regularity structures by an algebraic machinery that gives a systematic tool to remove non-local counterterms and provide a precise expression of the renormalised equation that is consistent with the semilinear case. The solution theory satisfies the chain rule and a natural notion of It\^o isometry, which can be combined to obtain global in time solution.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce explicit formulae for the coproducts at play for multi-indices in ODEs and in singular SPDEs. The two coproducts described correspond to versions of the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer and extraction/contraction coproducts with multi-indices. The main idea is to use the fact that these coproducts are the adjoints of dual products for which one has explicit simple formulae. We are able to derive the explicit formulae via an inner product defined from a symmetry factor easily computable for multi-indices.</description>

      <title>Full Field Inversion of the Attenuated Wave Equation: Theory and Numerical Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard photoacoustic tomography (PAT) provides data that consist of time-dependent signals governed by the wave equation, which are measured on an observation surface. In contrast, the measured data from the recently invented full-field PAT is the Radon transform of the solution of the wave equation on a spatial domain at a single instant in time. While reconstruction using classical PAT data has been extensively studied, not much is known about the full-field PAT problem. In this paper, we study full-field photoacoustic tomography with spatially variable sound speed and spatially variable damping. In particular, we prove the uniqueness and stability of the associated single-time full-field wave inversion problem and develop algorithms for its numerical inversion using iterative and variational regularization methods. Numerical simulations are presented for both full-angle and limited-angle data cases</description>
