      <title>Dynamically Tunable Membrane Metasurfaces for Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared spectroscopy enables biochemical sensing by identifying vibrational molecular fingerprints, but it faces limitations in instrumentation portability and analytical sensitivity. Optical metasurfaces with strong mid-IR photonic resonances provide an attractive solution towards on-chip spectrometry and sensitive molecular detection, yet their static nature hinders their anticipated impact. Here, we introduce and demonstrate dynamically tunable silicon membrane metasurfaces exhibiting high-Q transmissive resonances in the fingerprint region. By harnessing silicon's thermo-optical properties, we achieve continuous modulation of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-like modes that emerge upon the interference of quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) and surface lattice modes. We measure a spectral tuning rate of 0.06 $cm^{-1}/K$ by continuously sweeping the sharp EIT resonances over a 23.5 $cm^{-1}$ spectral range across a temperature range of 300-700 K. This dynamic transmission control enables non-contact chemical analysis of polymer films by detecting characteristic absorption bands of polystyrene (1450 and 1492 $cm^{-1}$) and Poly(methyl methacrylate) (1730 $cm^{-1}$) without bulky spectrometers. When analyte molecules fill the metasurface-generated photonic cavities, we demonstrate vibrational strong coupling between the Poly(methyl methacrylate)'s carbonyl band and the EIT mode, manifested in the Rabi splitting of $\sim$ 43 $cm^{-1}$. Our results establish a new photonic platform that unites spectral precision, strong field enhancement, and reconfigurability, offering diverse potential for compact mid-IR spectroscopy, molecular sensing, and programmable polaritonic photonics.</description>

      <title>Realization of Weyl elastic metamaterials with spin skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological elastic metamaterials provide a topologically robust way to manipulate the phononic energy and information beyond the conventional approaches. Among various topological elastic metamaterials, Weyl elastic metamaterials stand out, as they are unique to three dimensions and exhibit numerous intriguing phenomena and potential applications. To date, however, the realization of Weyl elastic metamaterials remains elusive, primarily due to the full-vectoral nature of elastic waves and the complicated couplings between polarizations, leading to complicated and tangled three-dimensional (3D) bandstructures that unfavorable for experimental demonstration. Here, we overcome the challenge and realize an ideal, 3D printed, all-metallic Weyl elastic metamaterial with low dissipation losses. Notably, the elastic spin of the excitations around the Weyl points exhibits skyrmion textures, a topologically stable structure in real space. Utilizing 3D laser vibrometry, we reveal the projection of the Weyl points, the Fermi arcs and the unique spin characteristics of the topological surface states. Our work extends the Weyl metamaterials to elastic waves and paves a topological way to robust manipulation of elastic waves in 3D space.</description>

      <title>Effect of current on terahertz plasmons in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz transmittance spectra of plasmonic crystals based on two-dimensional electron gas in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures were studied in grating-gate and gateless plasmonic crystals as a function of lateral bias. The decrease of the plasmon resonance frequencies (redshift) with increase of the lateral current was observed for both types of structures. We show that the change of the electron concentration profile and Joule heating are the main phenomena responsible for the shift of plasma resonant frequency. These results are important for designing plasmonic resonances based filters, detectors, and emitters operating under voltage bias conditions.</description>

      <title>Barium Calcium Zirconium Titanate Thin Film-Based Capacitive Thermoelectric Converter for Low-Grade Waste Heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A capacitive thermoelectric device can harvest thermal energy and convert it to electrical energy by employing a temperature-dependent dielectric material whose permittivity sharply changes with temperature. Electricity can be generated by fluctuating the temperature of the capacitor. Currently, capacitive thermoelectric devices are not broadly used, which can be attributed to the low efficiency of the existing solutions, the lack of dielectric materials with suitable temperature non-linearity of the dielectric permittivity, and the complexity of modulating heat flux on the dielectric material. Here, we propose a device based on (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Ti0.92Zr0.08)O3 and (Ba0.73Ca0.27)(Ti0.98Zr0.02)O3 thin films. The estimated power output under different operation conditions and dynamic workload of an Intel E5-2630 microprocessor show that these thin film materials are promising and can potentially be used for a capacitive thermoelectric converter.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Optical Actuation of n-GaAs Cantilevers via Surface Piezoelectric Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical behavior of any semiconductor microstructure is inevitably coupled to light. In the case of micro mechanical resonators (MEMs), carrier generation can affect the quality factor of the resonance through electron-phonon scattering and ohmic losses, but it may also inject energy into the structure and induce movement. Thus, semiconductor MEMs may be regarded as intrinsically optomechanical systems. Here, we report on the optical actuation of a simple-clamped n-GaAs cantilever. This is achieved through modulated nanowatt LED illumination at the resonance frequency. We propose that the mechanism responsible for the coupling between light and movement is piezoelectrically induced stress in the surface depletion layer. Motion may be detected using two methods: by measuring the piezoelectric voltage generated due to deformation or the current arising due to the capacitance changes. In the latter case, a bias voltage must be applied to the device, which leads to nonlinear dynamics. Our results indicate that photothermal and electrostatic effects can be ruled out because i) we measure a very small drift of the resonance frequency with the light modulation offset which, together with finite-element simulations, indicates photothermal effects are not responsible for actuation, ii) we observe a phase shift under different bias voltage polarities, which rules out electrostatic actuation and iii), static measurements performed using an optical profilometer confirm the piezoelectric nature of the interaction with light. In summary, we find homogeneous low power LED illumination to be an effective, simple and convenient method of actuation for piezoelectric semiconductor based MEMs.</description>

      <title>Synergistic control of radical generation in a radio frequency atmospheric pressure plasma jet via voltage waveform tailoring and structured electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synergy between voltage waveform tailoring and structured electrodes is investigated in a radio-frequency (RF) atmospheric-pressure microplasma jet operated in helium with a 0.1% oxygen admixture. The device incorporates rectangular trenches in both electrodes and is driven by "Peaks" and "Valleys" waveforms synthesized from four harmonics (base frequency $f_{\rm b} = 13.56$~MHz, $V_{\rm pp} = 500$~V, $P=$1.2~W). Two-dimensional plasma fluid simulations, together with spatially and temporally resolved optical diagnostics (Phase-Resolved Optical Emission Spectroscopy and Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy), are used to demonstrate that the combination of asymmetric voltage waveforms with electrode structuring leads to strong spatial localization of electron power absorption and radical generation. This synergy results in a single pronounced maximum inside a trench at either the powered or grounded electrode, depending on the applied waveform, unlike a symmetric excitation, which produces a spatially symmetric enhancement at both electrodes. The effect is attributed to the interplay between waveform-induced sheath dynamics and geometric focusing provided by the trenches, enabling electrically reversible and selective enhancement of electron power absorption at a chosen location.</description>

      <title>Coercive Field Reduction in Ultra-thin Al1-XScXN via Interfacial Engineering with a Scandium Electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectrics are promising for next-generation non-volatile memory applications due to their high remnant polarization as well as fast switching and scalability to nanometer thicknesses. As device dimensions shrink, the coercive field in ultra-thin ferroelectric films increases, which challenges low-voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase and improves ferroelectric performance. Robust ferroelectricity is observed in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, dynamic switching behavior is analyzed using the KAI model. At low frequencies (less than 16.7 kHz), capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents (0.036 and 0.028, respectively), indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent (0.093), indicating stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.036. Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction is used to measure strain differences in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, revealing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain, and switching behavior in ultra-thin films.</description>

      <title>Constructive interference at the edge of quantum ergodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum observables in the form of few-point correlators are the key to characterizing the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. In experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented to restore sensitivities of quantum observables. Using a 103-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we characterize ergodic dynamics using the second-order out-of-time-order correlators, OTOC$^{(2)}$. In contrast to dynamics without time reversal, OTOC$^{(2)}$ are observed to remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long time scales. Furthermore, by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution and randomizing the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture, we observe substantial changes in OTOC$^{(2)}$ values. This indicates that OTOC$^{(2)}$ is dominated by constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in configuration space. The observed interference mechanism endows OTOC$^{(2)}$ with a high degree of classical simulation complexity, which culminates in a set of large-scale OTOC$^{(2)}$ measurements exceeding the simulation capacity of known classical algorithms. Further supported by an example of Hamiltonian learning through OTOC$^{(2)}$, our results indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Runaway electron-induced plasma facing component damage in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Roadmap article addresses the critical and multifaceted challenge of plasma-facing component (PFC) damage caused by runaway electrons (REs) in tokamaks, a phenomenon that poses a significant threat to the viability and longevity of future fusion reactors such as ITER and DEMO. The dramatically increased RE production expected in future high-current tokamaks makes it difficult to avoid or mitigate REs when a plasma discharge terminates abnormally. Preventing damage from the intense localised heat loads REs can cause requires a holistic approach that considers plasma, REs and PFC damage. Despite decades of progress in understanding the physics of REs and the thermomechanical response of PFCs, their complex interplay remains poorly understood. This document aims to initiate a coordinated, interdisciplinary approach to bridge this gap by reviewing experimental evidence, advancing diagnostic capabilities, and improving modelling tools across different scales, dimensionalities and fidelities. Key topics include RE beam formation and transport, damage mechanisms in brittle and metallic PFCs, and observations in major facilities such as JET, DIII-D, WEST and EAST. The Roadmap emphasises the urgency of predictive, high-fidelity modelling validated against well-diagnosed controlled experiments, particularly in the light of recent changes in ITER's wall material strategy and the growing importance of private sector initiatives. Each section of the article is written to provide a concise overview of one area of this multidisciplinary subject, with an assessment of the status, a look at current and future challenges, and a brief summary. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to guide future mitigation strategies and design resilient components that can withstand the loads imposed by REs, thus ensuring the safe and sustainable operation of the next generation of fusion power plants.</description>

      <title>Broadband Tunable Deep-UV Emission from AI-Optimized Nonlinear Metasurface Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces represent a pivotal advancement in nonlinear optics, leveraging high-Q resonant cavities to enhance harmonic generation. Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLMs) further amplify this potential by intensifying light-matter interactions within individual meta-atoms at the nanoscale. However, maximizing nonlinear efficiency demands extreme field confinement through optimized designs of large geometric and material parameters, which exceed traditional simulation's computational ability. To overcome this, we introduce NanoPhotoNet-NL, an AI-driven design tool employing a hybrid deep neural network (DNN) that synergizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. This framework accelerates nonlinear MLM design speed by four orders of magnitude while maintaining over 98.3% prediction accuracy relative to physical simulators. The optimized MLMs achieve quality factors exceeding 50, enabling broadband third-harmonic generation (THG) in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) from wavelengths 200 nm to 260 nm via parametric sweeps. Furthermore, NanoPhotoNet-NL facilitates dynamically tunable DUV nanolight sources with 20 nm spectral coverage in the UVC band using low-loss nonlinear phase change materials. This work marks a transformative leap in nonlinear metasurface engineering, unlocking high-performance, reconfigurable platforms for nonlinear and quantum optical nanodevices.</description>

Abstract: Polarization optical fiber sensors are based on modifications of fiber birefringence by an external measurand (e.g. strain, pressure, acoustic waves). Yet, this means that different input states of polarization will result in very distinct behaviors, which may or may not be optimal in terms of sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. To tackle this challenge, this manuscript presents an optimization technique for the input polarization state using the Fisher information formalism, which allows for achieving maximal precision for a statistically unbiased metric. By first measuring the variation of the Mueller matrix of the optical fiber in response to controlled acoustic perturbations induced by piezo speakers, we compute the corresponding Fisher information operator. Using maximal information states of the Fisher information, it was possible to observe a significant improvement in the performance of the sensor, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio from 4.3 to 37.6 dB, attaining an almost flat response from 1.5 kHz up to 15 kHz. As a proof-of-concept for dynamic audio signal detection, a broadband acoustic signal was also reconstructed with significant gain, demonstrating the usefulness of the introduced formalism for high-precision sensing with polarimetric fiber sensors.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic media with artificial periodic modulation-magnonic crystals (MCs) - enable tunable spin-wave dynamics and band structure engineering. Nanoscaling enhances these capabilities, making magnonic nanocrystals promising for both fundamental studies and applications. Here, we report on the design, fabrication, and characterization of one-dimensional YIG MCs with nanoholes ($d \approx $ 150 nm) spaced $a \approx 1 \mu$m apart. Micro-focused Brillouin light scattering and propagating spin-wave spectroscopy, supported by TetraX and MuMax$^3$ simulations, reveal spin-wave transmission over 5 $\mu$m in the Damon-Eshbach configuration, and the formation of pronounced band gaps with rejection levels up to 26 dB. Detailed analysis of the spin-wave dispersion uncovered complex mode interactions, including two prominent anticrossings at 3.1 and 18.7 rad/$\mu$m, between which the spin-wave energy is predominantly carried by the $n$ = 2 mode, enabling efficient transmission. The results advance the development of functional MCs and open pathways toward 2D magnonic nanoarrays and magnonic RF nanodevices.</description>

      <title>A Taylor Series Approximation Model for Characterizing the Output Resistance of a GFET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mobility-degradation-based model for the drain-to-source or output resistance of a graphene field-effect-transistor is linearized here using a Taylor series approximation. This simplification is shown to be valid from magnitudes of the gate voltage not significantly higher than the Dirac voltage, and it enables the analytical determination of the transconductance parameter, the voltage related to residual charges, and a bias-independent series resistance of the GFET. Furthermore, a continuous representation of the device's static response is achieved when substituting the extracted parameters into the model, regardless the transfer characteristic symmetry with respect to the Dirac voltage.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the mystery of enhanced open-circuit voltages in nanotextured perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have reached power conversion efficiencies that rival those of established silicon photovoltaic technologies. Nanotextures in perovskite solar cells optimise light trapping and scattering, thereby improving optical absorption. In addition, nanotextures have been experimentally shown to enhance electronic performance, in particular, by increasing the open-circuit voltage $V_{\text{OC}}$ -- a phenomenon that, until now, has remained not fully understood. This study investigates the underlying reasons by combining multi-dimensional optical and charge-transport simulations for a single-junction perovskite solar cell. Our results reveal that the increased open-circuit voltage is not driven by optical effects but by the textured geometry itself. For voltages near $V_{\text{OC}}$, texturing one of the absorber/transport layer interfaces increases the imbalance between electron and hole densities in the absorber, thereby reducing Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, which is the dominant loss mechanism in this study. While idealised solar cells benefit unconditionally from increasing texture height, in realistic cells there is an optimal texture height which maximizes the power conversion efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the opto-electronic advantages of texturing and offer guidance for the design of next-generation textured perovskite-based solar cells, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Failure modes of irregular ceramic foam under compression: Development of a new image based strut segmentation strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work investigates the failure modes of the microstructure of an irregular ceramic foam subjected to uniaxial compression loading. The foam material is manufactured using the direct foaming method and has polydispersed pores homogeneously distributed in the microstructure. The effective stress-strain curve and the macroscopic strength of the material differs significantly with the predictions of the Gibson-Ashby model that assumes a regular microstructure. The objective of this work is to determine the reasons. The work builds upon an image segmentation algorithm that utilizes a skeletonization method followed by geometric pruning strategies to isolate the struts in the foam microstructure. In this work, a novel pruning strategy defined by a physics-based significance measure is proposed, which identifies the struts whose failure leads to macroscopic failure of the material. The stresses in the struts are calculated by a finite element simulation, which is then utilized to determine their failure modes. This also reveals the relationship between the strut orientation and their failure modes.The energy dissipated by the individual failure modes as the loading is increased shows that there are two dominant modes which are different from the bending failure reported in the Gibson-Ashby model. These failure modes are mixed compression-tension and pure compression.</description>
