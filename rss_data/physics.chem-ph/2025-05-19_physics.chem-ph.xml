      <title>Electrochemical performance and diffusion kinetics of a NASICON type Na$_{3.3}$Mn$_{1.2}$Ti$_{0.75}$Mo$_{0.05}$(PO$_4$)$_3$/C cathode for low-cost sodium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the electrochemical performance and diffusion kinetics of a newly designed NASICON type Na$_{3.3}$Mn$_{1.2}$Ti$_{0.75}$Mo$_{0.05}$(PO$_4$)$_3$/C composite material as a cathode for cost-effective sodium-ion batteries. A novel strategy of small Mo doping successfully stabilizes the sample having high Mn content in single phase rhombohedral symmerty. The high-resolution microscopy analysis reveals nanocrystallites of around $\sim$18 nm, uniformly embedded within the semi-graphitic carbon matrix, which enhances the surface electronic conductivity and effectively shortens the sodium-ion diffusion path. More importantly, we demonstrate a stable electrochemical behavior, with enhanced discharge capacity of 124 mAh/g at 0.1 C, having good reversibility and retaining 77\% of its capacity after 300 cycles, and 70\% even after 400 cycles at 2 C. The sodium-ion diffusion coefficients, estimated using both galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry are found to lie within the range of $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-11}$~cm$^2$/s. Additionally, the bond-valence site energy mapping predicted a sodium-ion migration energy barrier of 0.76 eV. A detailed distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis is used to deconvolute the electrochemical impedance spectra into distinct processes based on their characteristic relaxation times. Notably, the solid-state diffusion of sodium ions within the bulk electrode, with a relaxation time of $\sim$50 s, shows a consistent trend with the diffusion coefficients obtained from GITT and Warburg-based evaluations across the state of charge.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Coupled Circuits to Capture Dynamics of Ionic Transport in Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic transport within charged nanopores is commonly represented by resistor-capacitor transmission line circuits, where charging electrical double layers are modeled as capacitors, and the resistance to ionic current is modeled as resistors. However, these circuits fail to account for oscillations observed in experimental Nyquist plots of impedance, which are attributed ad hoc to effects such as complex porous structures or chemical reactions. Here, we show that diffusivity asymmetry between ions in confinement - overlooked in previous studies - produces Nyquist plots with two turns. Additionally, we demonstrate that ionic transport is more accurately described by magnetically coupled inductor-resistor circuits than by a simple resistor-capacitor circuit. Our results show that an impedance response of ionic transport in nanopores for arbitrary Debye lengths is better captured by two Warburg elements in parallel than a single Warburg element.</description>

      <title>Quantum Statistical Mechanics of Electronically Open Molecules: Reduced Density Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reduced density operator for electronically open molecules by explicitly averaging over the environmental degrees of freedom of the composite Hamiltonian. Specifically, we include the particle-number non-conserving (particle-breaking) interactions responsible for the sharing of electrons between the molecule and the environment, which are neglected in standard formulations of quantum statistical mechanics. We propose an unambiguous definition of the partial trace operation in the composite fermionic Fock space based on composite states in a second quantization framework built from a common orthonormal set of orbitals. Thereby, we resolve the fermionic partial trace ambiguity. The common orbital basis is constructed by spatial localization of the full orbital space, in which the full composite Hamiltonian naturally partitions into a molecule Hamiltonian, an environment Hamiltonian, and an interaction Hamiltonian. The new reduced density operator is based on the approximation of commutativity between the subsystem Hamiltonians (i.e., molecule and environment Hamiltonians) and the interaction Hamiltonian, which we show corresponds to excluding certain electron transfer channels and neglecting electron transfer relaxation effects. The reduced density operator can be viewed as a generalization of the grand canonical density operator. We are prompted to define the generalized chemical potential, which aligns with the standard interpretation of the chemical potential, apart from the possibility of fractional rather than strictly integer electron transfer in our framework. In contrast to standard approaches, our framework enables an explicit consideration of the electron occupancy in the environment at any level of theory, irrespective of the model used to describe the molecule.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of ionic liquids under shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic behavior of ionic liquids under shear flow, using a coarse-grained model of C4mim-PF6 as a prototypical example. The importance of long-ranged electrostatics is assessed as a function of shear rate by comparing Ewald and reaction field treatments. An appropriate comparison is achieved through the implementation of the proper Lees-Edwards boundary conditions within the ESPResSo++ simulation software. Our results demonstrate that while structural properties are relatively insensitive to the electrostatic treatment, the more accurate treatment via the Ewald approach is essential for studies of dynamics, in particular, at lower shear rates. Furthermore, we identify a critical shear rate beyond which structural and dynamical properties begin to deviate from equilibrium behavior, while remaining largely unchanged below this threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that the dynamic heterogeneity of the liquid decreases as a function of increasing shear rate, which can be primarily explained by the faster dynamics induced by the shear flow. These results hold relevance for investigations of process-dependent properties of ionic-liquid-based materials.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal dielectric properties of water: the role of electronic delocalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlocal dielectric properties of liquid water are studied in the context of {\it ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory. We calculate the dielectric response from the charge structure factor of the liquid using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We show that the dielectric response function of {\it ab initio} simulations differs significantly from that of classical force-fields, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, it exhibits a larger amplitude and a wider range of responding wave numbers. We suggest that the difference is due to the localisation of the electronic charge density inherent in classical force files and Wannier post-treatment of DFT densities. The localised charge models do not reproduce the shape of the response function even for $q$ corresponding to intermolecular distances, and could lead to a significant underestimation of the dielectric response of the liquid by a factor of 10.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified quantum geometric framework to understand reactive quantum dynamics. The critical roles of the quantum geometry of adiabatic electronic states in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic quantum dynamics are unveiled. A numerically exact, divergence-free topological quantum molecular dynamics method is developed through a discrete local trivialization of the projected electronic Hilbert space bundle over the nuclear configuration space. In this approach, the singular electronic quantum geometric tensor-Abelian for adiabatic dynamics and non-Abelian for non-adiabatic dynamics-is fully encoded in the global electronic overlap matrix. With numerical illustrations, it is demonstrated that atomic motion-whether adiabatic or non-adiabatic-is governed not only by the variation in electronic energies with nuclear configurations (potential energy surface) but also by the variation in electronic states (electronic quantum geometry).</description>

      <title>A Direct Diabatic States Construction Method with Consistent Orbitals for Valence and Rydberg States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel methodology termed Direct Diabatic States Construction (DDSC), which integrates fragment wavefunctions into an anti-symmetric wavefunction for the entire system. Using a fragment-localized state-consistent molecular orbital (FL-SC MO), this approach enables direct construction of all diabatic states at the same root. Each diabatic state is formed as a linear combination of a set of diabatic configurations. The validity and effectiveness of DDSC have been demonstrated through its application to the LiH molecule. The results show that this method is suitable for constructing both valence and Rydberg diabatic states. One of the key advantages of DDSC is its ability to directly compute diabatic couplings, which can be converted to non-adiabatic coupling (NAC) vectors along the reaction coordinate. The DDSC method efficiently builds the diabatic potential energy matrix (DPEM), especially for systems with clear fragment partitions and weak inter-fragment interactions, such as charge transfer reactions.</description>

      <title>Second roton feature in the strongly coupled electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the dynamic properties of the finite temperature uniform electron gas (UEG) over a broad range of densities, $2\leq r_s\leq300$. We demonstrate that the direct analysis of the imaginary-time density--density correlation function (ITCF) allows for a rigorous assessment of the density and temperature dependence of the previously reported roton-type feature [T.~Dornheim, \emph{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{121}, 255001 (2018)] at intermediate wavenumbers. We clearly resolve the emergence of a second roton at the second harmonic of the original feature for $r_s\gtrsim100$, which we identify as an incipient phonon dispersion. Finally, we use our highly accurate PIMC results for the ITCF as the basis for an analytic continuation to compute the dynamic structure factor, which additionally substantiates the existence of the second roton in the strongly coupled electron liquid. Our investigation further elucidates the complex interplay between quantum delocalization and Coulomb coupling in the UEG. All PIMC results are freely available online and provide valuable benchmarks for other theoretical methodologies and approximations.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality-dependent electronic and vibrational dynamics in low-dimensional organic-inorganic tin halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo-induced dynamics of electronic processes in materials are driven by the coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here we construct 1D and 2D organic-inorganic tin halides to investigate the functional role of dimensionality to exciton-phonon coupling (EPC) and exciton self-trapping. The results show that the 1D system has strong EPC leading to excitation-independent self-trapped exciton (STE) emission, while the 2D system exhibits over ten times weaker EPC resulting in free exciton emission. By performing femtosecond transient absorption experiments, we directly resolve the room-temperature vibrational wavepackets in the 1D system, some of which propagate along the STE potential energy surface. A combination of wagging and asymmetric stretching motions (~106 cm-1) in tin iodide is identified as such a mode inducing exciton self-trapping. While no room-temperature wavepackets are observed in the 2D system. These findings uncover the interplay between the dimensionality-dependent EPC and electronic/nuclear dynamics, offering constructive guidance to develop multifunctional organic-inorganic metal halides.</description>

      <title>Coherent Spectroscopic Probes of Topology: A Velocity-Gauge Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a velocity-gauge formalism for computing nonlinear current response functions in periodic systems and apply it to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as a minimal topological testbed. By retaining the full minimal coupling Hamiltonian and avoiding the rotating wave approximation, we construct gauge-consistent expressions for the linear and third-order current susceptibilities using retarded Green's functions. Our results reveal how nonlinear optical spectra encode not only energy-level transitions but also interband phase coherence and topological winding. In the topological phase, the third-order response exhibits characteristic phase inversions and spectral asymmetries that are absent in the trivial phase. These features reflect geometric changes in the Bloch eigenstates and highlight the role of virtual pathways in shaping the nonlinear signal. Our framework offers a robust and extensible platform for modeling nonlinear light-matter interactions in topological materials beyond the dipole approximation and the standard Coulomb-gauge formulation in molecular spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Reactant Entanglement in the Coherent Control of Ultracold Bimolecular Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a crucial resource for achieving quantum advantages in quantum computation, quantum sensing, and quantum communication. As shown in this Letter, entanglement is also a valuable resource for the coherent control of the large class of bimolecular chemical reactions. We introduce an entanglement-enhanced coherent control scheme, in which the initial preparation of the superposition state is divided into two steps: the first entangles the reactants, and the second is responsible for coherent control. This approach can overcome the limitations of traditional coherent control of scattering caused by non-interfering pathways, known as satellite terms. By tuning the amount of entanglement between reactants, the visibility of coherent control in chemical reactions can be modulated and optimized. Significantly, there exists an optimal amount of entanglement, which ensures complete indistinguishability of the reaction pathways, maximizing the extent of control. This entanglement-enhanced coherent control scheme is computationally illustrated using the ultracold KRb + KRb reaction, where a perfect control over the parity of the product rotational states is achieved.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay Between Formation Mechanisms and Luminescence of Lignin Carbon Quantum Dots from Spruce Biomass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the intricate relationship between the formation mechanisms and luminescent properties of lignin-derived carbon quantum dots (LG-CQDs) synthesized from spruce biomass by hydrothermal treatment. A comprehensive understanding of LG-CQD structure and its photoluminescence requires insights into the native architecture of lignin and the distribution of its acidolysis-derived fragments. Research showed how these lignin-derived units interact with dopant molecules in three different approaches during synthesis, contributing to core and surface structures that govern the optical behavior. Our findings reveal a clear correlation between structural features and luminescent properties, emphasizing the role of surface chemistry in tuning emission characteristics. These insights provide a foundation for the rational design of LG-CQDs with tailored luminescent properties, advancing their potential applications in sustainable optoelectronics, sensing, and bioimaging.</description>

      <title>Beyond real: Alternative unitary cluster Jastrow models for molecular electronic structure calculations on near-term quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-term quantum devices require wavefunction ans\"atze that are expressive while also of shallow circuit depth in order to both accurately and efficiently simulate molecular electronic structure. While unitary coupled cluster (e.g., UCCSD) has become a standard, the high gate count associated with the implementation of this limits its feasibility on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. K-fold unitary cluster Jastrow (uCJ) ans\"atze mitigate this challenge by providing $O(kN^2)$ circuit scaling and favorable linear depth circuit implementation. Previous work has focused on the real orbital-rotation (Re-uCJ) variant of uCJ, which allows an exact (Trotter-free) implementation. Here we extend and generalize the $k$-fold uCJ framework by introducing two new variants, Im-uCJ and g-uCJ, which incorporate imaginary and fully complex orbital rotation operators, respectively. Similar to Re-uCJ, both of the new variants achieve quadratic gate-count scaling. Our results focus on the simplest $k=1$ model, and show that the uCJ models frequently maintain energy errors within chemical accuracy. Both g-uCJ and Im-uCJ are more expressive in terms of capturing electron correlation and are also more accurate than the earlier Re-uCJ ansatz. We further show that Im-uCJ and g-uCJ circuits can also be implemented exactly, without any Trotter decomposition. Numerical tests using $k=1$ on $H_2$, $H_3^+$, $Be_2$, $C_2H_4$, $C_2H_6$ and $C_6H_6$ in various basis sets confirm the practical feasibility of these shallow Jastrow-based ans\"atze for applications on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Hole States in Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock Approaches: A Time-Domain Generalization of Extended Koopmans' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a time-domain generalization of the extended Koopmans' theorem within the framework of the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) theory. This formulation naturally yields well-defined time-dependent hole states formed by removing one electron from the multielectron system, enabling the instantaneous construction of reduced density matrices for the photofragments during MCTDHF simulations with negligible computational overhead. Leveraging this foundation, we derive the equation of motion for the time-dependent Dyson orbitals and develop a systematic approach to extract hole-resolved observables directly from the time-dependent \textit{ab initio} wavefunctions, such as channel-resolved photoelectron momentum distributions. The proposed method is universally applicable to both projection-based and flux-based schemes, offering a powerful tool for disentangling correlated electron-hole dynamics in ultrafast multichannel ionization processes.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Hole States in Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock Approaches: Applications in Photoionization of Water Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By simulating the real-time multielectron wavefunction with the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) approach, we conduct an \textit{ab initio} study of the single-photon ionization process of a body-fixed water molecule ($\mathrm{H_2O}$) driven by attosecond pulses. To this end, we present a full-dimensional implementation of the MCTDHF method based on one-center expansions, allowing for the simulation of arbitrarily polarized lasers and multi-center polyatomic potentials. With a rigorous definition of the time-dependent hole state (TDHS) using the time-domain generalization of extended Koopmans' theorem (TD-EKT), we derive the reduced ion density matrix within the MCTDHF framework, which inherently encodes the total and channel-resolved photoionization cross sections of $\mathrm{H_2O}$. The cross sections obtained are benchmarked against existing experimental and theoretical results, validating the TDHS formalism. Furthermore, by adjusting the phase delay and intensity ratio of a pair of orthogonally polarized attosecond pulses, we explore the ultrafast control of attosecond coherence between electronic states of $\mathrm{H_2O^+}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole-dipole resonance energy transfer for heavy element quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. When organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are easier to be satisfied. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for heavy element quenching in liquid scintillator solution.</description>

      <title>Computing excited states of molecules using normalizing flows</title>

Abstract: Calculations of highly excited and delocalized molecular vibrational states are computationally challenging tasks, which strongly depends on the choice of coordinates for describing vibrational motions. We introduce a new method that leverages normalizing flows -- parametrized invertible functions -- to learn optimal vibrational coordinates that satisfy the variational principle. This approach produces coordinates tailored to the vibrational problem at hand, significantly increasing the accuracy and enhancing basis-set convergence of the calculated energy spectrum. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated in calculations of the 100 lowest excited vibrational states of H$_2$S, H$_2$CO, and HCN/HNC. The method effectively captures the essential vibrational behavior of molecules by enhancing the separability of the Hamiltonian and hence allows for an effective assignment of approximate quantum numbers. We demonstrate that the optimized coordinates are transferable across different levels of basis-set truncation, enabling a cost-efficient protocol for computing vibrational spectra of high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>chemtrain: Learning Deep Potential Models via Automatic Differentiation and Statistical Physics</title>

Abstract: Neural Networks (NNs) are effective models for refining the accuracy of molecular dynamics, opening up new fields of application. Typically trained bottom-up, atomistic NN potential models can reach first-principle accuracy, while coarse-grained implicit solvent NN potentials surpass classical continuum solvent models. However, overcoming the limitations of costly generation of accurate reference data and data inefficiency of common bottom-up training demands efficient incorporation of data from many sources. This paper introduces the framework chemtrain to learn sophisticated NN potential models through customizable training routines and advanced training algorithms. These routines can combine multiple top-down and bottom-up algorithms, e.g., to incorporate both experimental and simulation data or pre-train potentials with less costly algorithms. chemtrain provides an object-oriented high-level interface to simplify the creation of custom routines. On the lower level, chemtrain relies on JAX to compute gradients and scale the computations to use available resources. We demonstrate the simplicity and importance of combining multiple algorithms in the examples of parametrizing an all-atomistic model of titanium and a coarse-grained implicit solvent model of alanine dipeptide.</description>

      <title>Learning Equivariant Non-Local Electron Density Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07972</link>

Abstract: The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</description>

      <title>Mol-LLaMA: Towards General Understanding of Molecules in Large Molecular Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in task transfer, they often struggle to accurately analyze molecular features due to limited knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we present Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules and exhibits explainability and reasoning ability. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental molecular features, taking into account the essential abilities for molecular reasoning. Further, to improve molecular understanding, we propose a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and providing informative responses, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.
