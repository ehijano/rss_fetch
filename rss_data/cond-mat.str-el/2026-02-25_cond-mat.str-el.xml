      <title>Elliptic mirror of the quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toroidal sigma models of magneto-transport are analyzed, in which integer and fractional quantum Hall effects automatically are unified by a {holomorphic modular symmetry}. By exploiting a quantum equivalence called \emph{mirror symmetry}, these models are mapped to tractable mirror models (also elliptic), in which topological protection is provided by more familiar winding numbers. Phase diagrams and scaling properties of elliptic models are compared to some of the experimental and numerical data accumulated over the past three decades. The geometry of scaling flows extracted from quantum Hall experiments is in good agreement with modular predictions, including the location of many quantum critical points. One conspicuous model %(arguably the simplest and most natural one) has a critical delocalization exponent $\nu_{\rm tor} = 18 \ln 2 /(\pi^2 G^4) = 2.6051\dots$ ($G$ is Gauss' constant) that is in excellent agreement with the value $\nu_{\rm num} = 2.607\pm\,.004$ calculated in the numerical Chalker-Coddington model, suggesting that these models are in the same universality class. The real delocalization exponent may be disentangled from other scaling exponents in finite size scaling experiments, giving an experimental value $\nu_{\rm exp} = 2.3\pm 0.2$. The modular model suggests how these theoretical and experimental results may be reconciled, but in order to determine if these theoretical models really are in the quantum Hall universality class, improved finite size scaling experiments are urgently needed.</description>

      <title>Real-space construction and classification for time-reversal symmetric crystalline superconductors in 2D interacting fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline symmetry and time-reversal symmetry are commonly present in real superconducting materials. However, the topological classification of systems respecting these symmetries, particularly for interacting fermions, remains incomplete. In this work, we systematically classify time-reversal symmetry-protected crystalline topological superconductors in two-dimensional interacting fermionic systems using an explicit real-space construction. Among the resulting phases, we identify intrinsically interacting fermionic topological superconductors, i.e., phases that cannot be realized in either free-fermion or interacting bosonic systems. For spinless fermions with protecting symmetry group $C_4 \times Z_2^T$ or $D_4 \times Z_2^T$ (plus fermion parity), the intrinsic sector has a $Z_4$ classification. The corresponding root phases generating this $Z_4$ classification admit a transparent real-space construction in terms of decorated 1D blocks. These blocks are 1D fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) phases, realizable as double Majorana chains. We further find the corresponding $Z_4$ spinless intrinsic phases for wallpaper groups $p4$, $p4m$, and $p4g$. We also find an additional $Z_2$ intrinsically interacting phase for spinless fermions with wallpaper group $pm$, which is absent with the corresponding point-group symmetry alone. Moreover, these intrinsic phases naturally give rise to higher-order FSPT phases that support corner zero modes. Finally, we verify the crystalline equivalence principle for generic 2D interacting FSPT systems with both crystalline and internal symmetries.</description>

      <title>Kondo breakdown as an entanglement transition driven by continuous measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the breakdown of Kondo screening by a local magnetic field from the perspective of a measurement-driven entanglement transition in a monitored quantum system. Here, the Kondo coupling leads to the growth in entanglement of an impurity spin with it's fermionic environment, while the local field plays the role of a continuous observer. Using a non-perturbative Unitary Renormalization Group (URG) approach, we derive coupled renormalization-group flow equations for the Kondo exchange and the local field, and obtain a field-dependent RG phase diagram. The RG flows separate a low-energy Kondo-screened phase, where the impurity is absorbed into the Fermi sea and forms an entangled singlet with the conduction bath, from a polarized local-moment phase in which screening is frustrated and impurity-bath entanglement is suppressed. We identify the fixed-point Hamiltonians governing the two phases and the critical regime, and relate the transition to the emergence of a novel non-Fermi liquid. Various impurity signatures such as the spectral function and thermalisation of impurity observables are used to characterise this entanglement transition. These results offer insight into the interplay of decoherence and measurement in governing the dynamics of a prototypical quantum system.</description>

      <title>Parameterizing DFT+U+V from Hybrid Functionals: A Wannier-Function-Based Approach for Strongly Correlated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to parameterize DFT+$U$+$V$ from hybrid-functional calculations using Wannier-function projections. The method constructs a common localized Wannier basis for both semilocal DFT and hybrid-functional calculations, then determines effective on-site ($U$) and intersite ($V$) Hubbard parameters by minimizing the Hamiltonian mismatch within the correlated subspace. This procedure yields interaction parameters that reproduce the hybrid-functional electronic structure at a fraction of the computational cost and allow efficient structural relaxations and further many-body calculations. We validate the workflow on three oxide systems with different electronic characters: MgO (wide-gap insulator), NiO (antiferromagnetic charge-transfer insulator), and V$_2$O$_5$ (d$^0$ transition-metal oxide). In all cases, the mapped DFT+$U$+$V$ parameters reproduce hybrid-functional band gaps, densities of states, and magnetic moments and improve upon semilocal DFT while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Properties of the One-Dimensional Dimerized Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties of the one-dimensional dimerized Fermi-Hubbard model. Using a matrix-product-state approach, we compute the ground state and identify two insulating phases at 1/2- and 3/4-filling, along with a metallic phase, whose mechanisms can be characterized by their entanglement spectra. Our findings indicate that the two insulating phases are distinct, implying that the phase at 1/2-filling has a charge gap arising from the band gap, which is enhanced by repulsive interactions, while the phase at 3/4-filling exhibits a Mott gap resulting from particle interactions. This difference between the two insulating phases is reflected in the scaling properties of the half-chain entanglement entropy and the distribution of the entanglement spectrum.</description>

      <title>Probing frustrated spin systems with impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effective interaction between two localized spin impurities embedded in a frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1\!-\!J_2$ Heisenberg chain. Treating the impurity spins as classical moments coupled locally to the host, we combine second--order perturbation theory with large--scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations to determine the impurity--impurity interaction as a function of separation, coupling strength, and magnetic frustration. In the weak--coupling regime, we show that the interaction is governed by the the static spin susceptibility of the host and exhibits oscillatory power--law decay in the gapless phase, modified by universal logarithmic corrections at the SU(2)--symmetric critical point. In the gapped dimerized phase, the interaction decays exponentially with distance. For intermediate and strong impurity--host coupling, we observe a crossover to a boundary--dominated regime characterized by pronounced parity effects associated with the length of the chain segment between impurities, signaling a breakdown of the simple RKKY--like description. Our results establish impurity--impurity interactions as a sensitive probe of frustrated quantum spin liquids and provide a controlled framework for distinguishing gapless and gapped phases through local perturbations.</description>

      <title>Minimal loop currents in doped Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $t$-$J$ model, variational wave functions can generally be constructed based on an accurate description of antiferromagnetism (AFM) at half-filling and an exact phase-string sign structure under doping. The single-hole-doped and two-hole-doped states, as determined by variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulations, display sharply contrasting behaviors. The single-hole state constitutes a ``cat state'' that resonates strongly between a quasiparticle component and a local loop-current component, with approximately equal weights. In the ground state, the quasiparticle spectral weight $Z_{\mathbf{k}}$ peaks at momenta $\mathbf{k}_0 \equiv (\pm\frac{\pi}{2},\pm\frac{\pi}{2})$. The total-energy dispersion versus $\mathbf{k}$ agrees remarkably well with the Green function Monte Carlo results. However, Landau's one-to-one correspondence hypothesis for quasiparticles breaks down here with the incoherent component exhibiting intrinsic magnetization originating from a minimal $2\times2$ loop current that forms a $4\times4$ pattern on the square lattice--a finding in excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. In the two-hole ground state, a new pairing mechanism is revealed: the two holes are automatically fused into a tightly bound object consisting of an incoherent $d_{xy}$ pairing along the diagonal direction by compensating the local loop currents. This hole pair is again a ``cat state'' that resonates strongly between the incoherent $d_{xy}$ and a coherent $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Cooper channel to gain substantial hopping energy. Its size extends over an area of about $4\times 4$ lattice spacings, much smaller than the divergent AFM correlation length, implying that it should survive as a minimal superconducting building block even in the dilute doping regime. Experimental implications and the generalization to the finite-doping case are briefly addressed.</description>

      <title>Stochastic tensor contraction for quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many computational methods in ab initio quantum chemistry are formulated in terms of high-order tensor contractions, whose cost determines the size of system that can be studied. We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Qubit Noise Spectroscopy of Superconducting Dynamics in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An applied magnetic field affects a superconductor in two ways -- by promoting pairing fluctuations, and by inducing topological defects called vortices that carry quantized magnetic flux. A quantitative characterization of the resultant field-induced superconducting dynamics with spatio-temporal resolution remains challenging, particularly in two-dimensional materials. In this work, we analyze magnetic noise measured by the depolarization rate of a proximate single spin-qubit as a non-invasive probe of such dynamical fluctuations. We demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the magnetic noise spectrum near $T_c$ deviates from predictions based on quasiparticle excitations due to critical superconducting fluctuations, which in turn are enhanced by a weak applied field. By analyzing the magnetic noise due to vortex dynamics, we further show that noise spectroscopy is not only able to distinguish between different vortex phases, but also extract key physical quantities of interest, such as oscillation frequencies of pinned vortices, phonon dispersion of vortex lattices and vortex diffusivity in a vortex liquid. Complementing recent work on noise magnetometry of quasiparticle excitations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in two-dimensional superconductors without an applied field, our work highlights the ability of noise spectroscopy to reveal a wealth of superconducting dynamical phenomena in an applied field.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates: itinerant perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates from an itinerant perspective. Starting from a tight binding fit to recent ARPES measurements on compressively strained thin films, we incorporate the standard set of onsite repulsive interactions among partially filled $e_g$ orbitals: intra-orbital $U$, inter-orbital $U'$, Hund's coupling $J_H$ and a pair hopping $J_P$. We obtain the effective pairing interaction by dressing these bare interactions with particle-hole fluctuations via the RPA. In the strong Hund's coupling regime, we find that $s$-wave superconductivity and $(\pi/2, \pi/2)$ SDW order are the favored ground states. With weaker Hund's coupling, we find that $d$-wave pairing and $(\pi, \pi)$ SDW are the leading ground states. Our results are qualitatively consistent with earlier DMRG studies, and point to the key role played by Hund's coupling in determining the nature of superconductivity and magnetism in this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Known holographic dictionaries, especially AdS/CFT, rely on symmetry matching between the bulk and the boundary. We take a step toward a holographic dictionary with no symmetry requirement and without assuming the geometry being asymptotically AdS. Starting from any interacting Majorana generalized free field on a $(0+1)$d boundary and its two-point function data, we derive a concise analytic formula for the dual $(1+1)$d bulk geometry, borrowing techniques from unitary matrix integral and inverse scattering. Using this formula, we compute the near-horizon curvature, give conditions for positive versus negative curvature, and identify simple boundary models with de Sitter or anti-de Sitter near-horizon duals. We also study the large-$q$ SYK model, finding an unusual temperature dependence of the near-horizon curvature, related to the discrepancy between physical temperature and the ``fake disk'' temperature. We also construct, directly from boundary operators, approximate algebras generated by null translations and boost that become exact at the bifurcate horizon.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Barriers from Computational Complexity: Matrix-Product-State Approach to Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We approach the 3-SAT satisfiability problem with the quantum-inspired method of imaginary time propagation (ITP) applied to matrix product states (MPS) on a classical computer. This ansatz is fundamentally limited by a quantum entanglement barrier that emerges in imaginary time, reflecting the exponential hardness expected for this NP-complete problem. Strikingly, we argue based on careful analysis of the structure imprinted onto the MPS by the 3-SAT instances that this barrier arises from classical computational complexity. To reveal this connection, we elucidate with stochastic models the specific relationship between the classical hardness of the $\sharp$P $\supseteq$ NP-complete counting problem $\sharp$3-SAT and the entanglement properties of the quantum state. Our findings illuminate the limitations of this quantum-inspired approach and demonstrate how purely classical computational complexity can manifest in quantum entanglement. Furthermore, we present estimates of the non-stabilizerness required by the protocol, finding a similar resource barrier. Specifically, the necessary amount of non-Clifford operations scales superlinearly in system size, thus implying extensive resource requirements of ITP on different architectures such as Clifford circuits or gate-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford symmetry protected topological higher-order cluster states in multi-qubit measurement-based quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cluster state is a strongly entangled state, which is a source of measurement-based quantum computation. It is generated by applying controlled-Z (CZ) gates to the state $\left\vert ++\cdots +\right\rangle $. It is protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{ \text{odd}}$ symmetry. By applying general quantum gates to the state $ \left\vert ++\cdots +\right\rangle $, we systematically obtain a general short-range entangled cluster state. If we use a non-Clifford gate such as the controlled phase-shift gate, we obtain a non-Clifford cluster state. Furthermore, if we use the controlled-controlled Z (CCZ) gate instead of the CZ gate, we obtain non-Clifford cluster states with five-body entanglement. We generalize it to the C$^{N}$Z gate, where $(2N+1)$-body entangled states are generated. The $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{odd}}$ symmetry is non-Clifford for $N\geq 3$. We demonstrate that there emerge $2^{2N}$ fold degenerate ground states for an open chain, indicating the emergence of $N$ free spins at each edge. They can be used as an $N$-qubit input and an $N$-qubit output in measurement-based quantum computation. We also study the non-invertible symmetry, the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation and the string-order parameter in addition to the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{odd}}$ symmetry in these models.</description>

For device fabrication, compounds that can be epitaxially grown on III-V semiconductors are particularly attractive. We present a first-principles investigation of four Co-based and two Ni-based Heusler compounds that are lattice-matched to InAs. The results of density functional theory (DFT) using semi-local and hybrid functionals are compared to quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ (QPGW). We also consider DFT with machine-learned Hubbard $U$ corrections [npj Computational Materials 6, 180 (2020)] with a new Bayesian optimization (BO) objective function to determine the $U$ values that yield the closest agreement with the QPGW band structure and magnetic moments. We find that DFT+U(BO) can adequately reproduce the key QPGW features in most cases. Our results reveal a strong method dependence of the degree of spin polarization at the Fermi level and, in some cases, even the dominant spin channel (majority or minority). Of the materials studied here, Co$_2$TiSn and Co$_2$ZrAl are the most likely to be half-metals, and Co$_2$MnIn is likely to be a near-half-metal.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-enhanced electron-phonon coupling in FeSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions among lattice, charge, and spin degrees of freedom fundamentally shape material properties. In FeSe, symmetry-breaking perturbations serve as highly sensitive probes of these couplings. Previous work has shown that defects and isoelectronic substitution can substantially alter these interactions, giving rise to additional phonon modes. In this study, uniaxial strain is employed as a tunable symmetry-breaking control parameter to probe the intrinsic lattice response in the absence of disorder. The temperature evolution of phonon excitations was examined with fine temperature resolution in the vicinity of the nemato-structural transition temperature $T_s$, under strain applied along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ and $\langle 100 \rangle$ crystallographic directions. A subtle asymmetry of the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode appears in the unstrained crystal within a narrow temperature window around $T_s$, originating from the emergence of an additional mode in the fully symmetric channel. With applied strain, this feature becomes more distinctly resolved. The anomaly is attributed to modifications of the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom driven by the ordering fluctuations right above the nematic transition. These fluctuations enhance susceptibility for phonon-electron-phonon coupling in the vicinity of the X and R points of the Brillouin zone and promote two-phonon scattering close to the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode. The presence of this two-phonon scattering depends on both the strength and the direction of the applied strain, indicating a high sensitivity of FeSe to local symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Efficient two-color Floquet control of the RKKY interaction in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in real materials can mask the intrinsic spin-dependent properties of hosts. They interact indirectly through the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism, which limits the use of isolated impurity spins in applications such as qubits and spintronics. Suppressing the RKKY interaction would therefore enable access to the host's unperturbed behavior while simultaneously isolating impurity spins for functional use. Although single-color laser driving can suppress the RKKY interaction, it typically requires strong fields that may be impractical or destabilizing. To overcome these limitations, we show that two-color laser driving provides efficient and tunable control over all components of the RKKY interaction using two weak laser fields. Focusing on two-dimensional Rashba altermagnets, we show that interference between one- and two-photon processes produces altermagnet-specific Floquet corrections. These include additional AC Stark shifts, magnetizations, spin-orbit renormalization, and emergent in-plane Zeeman fields that are absent under single-color driving and in non-altermagnetic systems. Notably, two-color driving induces a finite $z$-component of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, stabilizing in-plane chiral magnetism and related textures in Rashba altermagnets. These effects enable tunable, near-complete on-off switching of the Heisenberg, Ising, and DM interactions through a Lifshitz-like modulation of the Fermi surface. We also show that the tuning process is highly sensitive to the chirality of both beams. We further map phase diagrams for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic impurity alignment with clockwise and counterclockwise canting as functions of Rashba coupling and altermagnetic order. Finally, we discuss candidate material platforms and experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Topological Floquet Green's function zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum emulation using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and an increased interest in topological Green's function zeros in condensed matter systems, we here study Green's function zeros in topological Floquet systems. We concentrate on interacting Kitaev-like Floquet chains (or equivalently transverse field Ising circuits) and introduce Floquet Green's-function-based topological invariants for the corresponding symmetry class BDI. In the vicinity of special points in the free fermion phase diagram and using tailor-made interactions which lead to the Floquet version of symmetric mass generation, we analytically calculate both edge and bulk Green's functions. Just as in the case of continuum time evolution, topological bands of Green's function zeros may also contribute to the topological invariant. However, contrary to the case of continuum time evolution, Floquet Green's functions can have zeros even in the absence of interactions. Finally, we also discuss an implementation of this Floquet system in a digital quantum emulator: We present a circuit which encodes the interaction under consideration and pinpoint the observables carrying information about the topological Green's function boundary zeros.</description>

      <title>Disentangling pre-transitional fluctuations in metallic VO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: VO2 features concomitant structural and metal-insulator transitions. This poses a challenge for understanding the underlying mechanism: is the transition triggered by a structural or by an electronic instability? The two scenarios are expected to produce very different pre-transitional fluctuations above TC. By combining magnetic susceptibility, IR reflectivity and X-ray diffuse scattering measurements, we observe that metallic VO2 features strong electronic and structural fluctuations towards the insulating monoclinic phase. By measuring resonant diffuse X-ray scattering across the Vanadium K-edge, we search for a potential decoupling between electronic and structural ordering in these fluctuations, finding no evidence of it. While our results do not completely rule out pure electronic fluctuations, they constrain them, favoring the interpretation that the VO2 metal-insulator transition is triggered by a structural instability. Our work offers a novel approach to solve similar problems in other strongly correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: We report the study of phases and transitions of SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field on the triangular lattice. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 &lt;= N &lt;= 8, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from parton large-N mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U and the number of flavor N . We construct the critical theory for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid and calculate the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N . These results could be validated in synthetic systems such as moire superlattices and cold atom platforms.</description>

      <title>Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16298v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</description>

      <title>Structures of group-15 elemental solids from an effective boundary theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an effective description for the crystal structures of pnictogen elemental solids. In these materials, each atom contains three valence electrons in $p$ orbitals. They are shared between neighbouring atoms to form valence bonds. We propose a trivalent network model on the simple cubic lattice. As a generalization of a dimer model, we impose a constraint that three dimers must touch every site. We argue that intra-orbital Coulomb repulsion prohibits the formation of two adjacent, parallel dimers. This leads to a tripod-like local configuration at every site. More importantly, it forces every line of the cubic lattice to have alternating dimers and blanks. There is no dynamics as dimers cannot be locally rearranged. A bulk-boundary mapping emerges whereby bonds in the interior are fully described by Ising variables on three bounding planes -- a simple example of holography that may be realized in real materials. To describe the energetics of bonding, we formulate a minimal model in terms of boundary Ising spins. Symmetries reduce the problem to that of three identical, independent, two-dimensional Ising models. An antiferromagnetic Ising-ground-state corresponds to the A7 structure seen in antimony and grey arsenic. An antiferromagnetic phase within a bilayer describes the structure of phosphorene. By stacking such bilayers, we obtain the A17 structure of black phosphorus. The stripe phase of the Ising models describes the cubic gauche structure of nitrogen. As a testable signature, we demonstrate that single impurities will induce long-ranged domain walls.</description>

      <title>Excitons and Optical Response in Excitonic Insulator Candidate TiSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the charge density wave (CDW) phase in TiSe$_2$ is a highly debated topic, with lattice and excitonic correlations proposed as the main driving mechanisms. One of the proposed scenarios is the excitonic insulator (EI) mechanism, where soft electronic mode drives the phase transition. However, the existence of this purely electronic mode is controversial. Here, we perform fully ab-initio calculations of the electron excitation spectra in TiSe$_2$ with electron-hole excitonic effects included via Bethe-Salpeter equations. In the normal high-temperature phase the excitation spectra is dominated by the exciton mode at 1.6 eV, while no well-defined soft electronic modes that could support the EI phase are present. In the CDW phase, the structural distortions induce a CDW band-gap opening between Ti-$d$ and Se-$p$ states, which supports the formation of the two low-energy excitonic modes in the optical spectrum at 0.4 eV and 80 meV. Close to the transition temperature $T_{\rm CDW}$, these two excitonic modes are softened and approach zero energy. These results suggest that the EI mechanism is not a main driving force in the formation of the CDW phase in TiSe$_2$, but there is a region in the phase diagram near $T_{\rm CDW}$ where EI fluctuations could be relevant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless quantum matter stems from low-energy descriptions using conformal field theory. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the underlying quantum geometry by considering finite many-body systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that probe the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. The former is less sensitive to decoherence than the latter, so it can provide robust experimental signatures of our predictions. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the emergent effective description. This is supported both by numerical simulations of gapless lattice models, and by exact results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, probing the full dynamical parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We present an infrared spectroscopy study of the layered topological semimetal TaNiTe$_5$, a material with a quasi-one-dimensional structure and strong in-plane anisotropy. Despite its structural features, infrared reflectivity and electronic transport measurements along the $a$ and $c$ crystallographic axes show metallic behavior without evidence of reduced dimensionality. Optical conductivity reveals an anisotropic but conventional metallic response with low scattering rates and a single sharp infrared-active phonon mode at $396$ cm$^{-1}$ ($49$ meV). Ab initio calculations closely match the experimental optical data and confirm a three-dimensional electronic structure. Our results demonstrate that TaNiTe$_5$ behaves as a three-dimensional anisotropic semimetal in its electronic and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Additional quantum many-body scars of the spin-$1$ $XY$ model with Fock-space cages and commutant algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, characterized by the coexistence of atypical non-thermal eigenstates within an otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum. In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-resolved Mott crossover and entanglement in the half-filled Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction-driven reorganization of spin and charge correlations in finite Hubbard clusters using exact diagonalization. Focusing on half-filled and lightly doped square lattices, we analyze spin-resolved charge-gaps, local observables, two-point correlation functions, entanglement measures, principal component analysis (PCA) of correlation matrices and quantum-geometry-based distance metrics. At half-filling, we observe the emergence of a robust Mott gap whose spin-dependent component is controlled by the effective exchange energy scale J~4t^2/U at strong coupling, confirming that residual spin dynamics govern the separation between the lowest-spin and the next higher-spin charge excitation channels. Distinct cluster geometries and boundary conditions reveal how spin-singlet versus finite-spin ground-state influence charge and spin responses. Upon one-hole doping, the spin-resolved charge-gaps collapses, indicating restored compressibility and metallic behavior. PCA and quantum-geometry-based analysis provide complementary data-driven and wavefunction-based perspectives on correlation-driven Mott crossover phenomena. Our results demonstrate that finite-size Hubbard clusters exhibit clear signatures of the Mott physics, spin-charge interplay and emergent exchange energy scales, offering a unified microscopic picture of interaction-induced electronic reorganization.</description>

      <title>Jordan-Wigner Transformation for the Description of Strong Correlation in Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seniority is a useful way of organizing Hilbert space for strongly correlated systems. The exact zero-seniority wave function, doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), provides accurate results (given the right orbitals) for many strongly correlated electronic systems but has a combinatorial computational cost. In many cases, pair coupled cluster doubles provides a polynomial-cost approximation that closely reproduces the energies of DOCI, but it breaks down in some cases and, as shown herein, it does not provide particularly good density matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that by using the Jordan-Wigner transformation to turn the seniority zero problem back into a fermionic one, we can provide mean-field variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and a few small molecular dissociation examples, with polynomial cost, both for the energies and for density matrices, all while being protected from collapse. This success is rooted in the proof we provide showing that the Hartree-Fock wave function on the Jordan-Wigner--transformed Hamiltonian transforms back to variational coupled cluster doubles in the seniority zero representation, but restricted to have determinant rather than permanent amplitude coefficients, without compromising its overall accuracy.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Shastry-Sutherland Model under Magnetic Field</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the $T$-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, we perform the state-of-the-art thermal tensor-network computation on the Shastry-Sutherland model under a magnetic field. Our simulation results suggest the existence of a symmetric intermediate phase with $T$-linear specific heat at low temperature, occupying a large parameter space and between the plaquette-singlet phase and antiferromagnetic phase at low fields and other symmetry-breaking phases at high fields before the system is fully polarized. Such an unexpected novel state bears an astonishing similarity to the experimental findings in the material. It opens the door to further investigations of the possible liberation of deconfined magnetized Dirac spinons by the competing interactions in this highly frustrated quantum magnet model, and by the combined effects of magnetic field and pressure in the associated Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Magnetopological mechanics in Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological boundary modes, a hallmark of quantum topological phases, remarkably occur in classical mechanical systems through an interesting correspondence with the quantum case. Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagom\'e lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes. We expect this work to inspire interests in the Maxwell lattice Mott insulating materials and the coupling between lattices and electronic orders.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab initio auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is a systematically improvable many-body method, but its application to extended solids has been severely limited by unfavorable computational scaling and memory requirements that obstruct direct access to the thermodynamic and complete-basis-set limits. By combining tensor hypercontraction with $\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $\mathcal O(N^3)$ and $\mathcal O(N^2)$, respectively, with an arbitrary basis, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Oddities in the Entanglement Scaling of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Evidence for Strongly Correlated Superconductivity Driven by Structural Variations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct first-principles simulations of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a nickelate in which recent experiments have shown signs of high-temperature superconductivity. Within the hydrostatic pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in effective on-site repulsion in the maximally localised Wannier functions comprising the Ni $e_g$ bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase to an interplay between orbital localisation and competing screening channels arising from structural variations. Our results indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations, which show a close correspondence with the critical temperature. Including finite temperatures up to 100 K, $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics simulations then provide new insights into the debated structural phase diagram and further clarify the origin of the right-triangular superconducting dome. Finally, we study Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to confirm the crucial role of the $A$-site cation in shaping the pressure-driven evolution of electronic correlations.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium transport through an interacting monitored quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between strong correlations and Markovian dephasing, resulting from monitoring the charge or spin degrees of freedom of a quantum dot described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model. Using the Auxiliary master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics. Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Chern band in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e flat bands in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a platform for exploring interaction-driven topological phases, where a single isolated band often forms a Chern band. However, non-Abelian degenerate Chern bands with internal symmetries such as $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ have so far been realized only in highly engineered systems. Here, we show that a doubly degenerate non-Abelian Chern band with Chern number $|C|=1$ emerges spontaneously at filling $\nu=2$ in rhombohedral 3-, 4-, and 5-layer graphene, regardless of the presence of an hBN substrate. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we map out phase diagrams as functions of displacement field and electronic periodicity, and analytically demonstrate that the Fock term drives spontaneous symmetry breaking and generates non-Abelian Berry curvature. We further show that this non-Abelian topology is characterized by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge flux threading the noncontractible cycles of the Brillouin zone, leading to a global non-Abelian holonomy. Our findings unveil a new class of interaction-driven non-Abelian topological phases, distinct from quantum anomalous Hall and fractional Chern phases.</description>

      <title>Construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states in the SU($N$) Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.</description>
