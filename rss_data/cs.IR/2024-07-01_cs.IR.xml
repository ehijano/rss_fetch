      <title>Doc2Token: Bridging Vocabulary Gap by Predicting Missing Tokens for E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the "vocabulary mismatch" issue in information retrieval is a central challenge for e-commerce search engines, because product pages often miss important keywords that customers search for. Doc2Query[1] is a popular document-expansion technique that predicts search queries for a document and includes the predicted queries with the document for retrieval. However, this approach can be inefficient for e-commerce search, because the predicted query tokens are often already present in the document. In this paper, we propose Doc2Token, a technique that predicts relevant tokens (instead of queries) that are missing from the document and includes these tokens in the document for retrieval. For the task of predicting missing tokens, we introduce a new metric, "novel ROUGE score". Doc2Token is demonstrated to be superior to Doc2Query in terms of novel ROUGE score and diversity of predictions. Doc2Token also exhibits efficiency gains by reducing both training and inference times. We deployed the feature to production and observed significant revenue gain in an online A/B test, and launched the feature to full traffic on Walmart.com.

      <title>Learning Interpretable Legal Case Retrieval via Knowledge-Guided Case Reformulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal case retrieval for sourcing similar cases is critical in upholding judicial fairness. Different from general web search, legal case retrieval involves processing lengthy, complex, and highly specialized legal documents. Existing methods in this domain often overlook the incorporation of legal expert knowledge, which is crucial for accurately understanding and modeling legal cases, leading to unsatisfactory retrieval performance. This paper introduces KELLER, a legal knowledge-guided case reformulation approach based on large language models (LLMs) for effective and interpretable legal case retrieval. By incorporating professional legal knowledge about crimes and law articles, we enable large language models to accurately reformulate the original legal case into concise sub-facts of crimes, which contain the essential information of the case. Extensive experiments on two legal case retrieval benchmarks demonstrate superior retrieval performance and robustness on complex legal case queries of KELLER over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Rateless Stochastic Coding for Delay-constrained Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint source-channel coding with distortion and perception constraints from a rateless perspective, the purpose of which is to settle the balance between reliability (distortion/perception) and effectiveness (rate) of transmission over uncertain channels. We find a new finite-blocklength bound for the achievable joint source-channel code rate with the above two constraints. To achieve a superior rateless characteristic of JSCC coding, we perform multi-level optimization on various finite-blocklength codes. Based on these two, we then propose a new JSCC coding scheme called rateless stochastic coding (RSC). We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed RSC can achieve variable rates of transmission maintaining an excellent trade-off between distortion and perception.</description>

      <title>TocBERT: Medical Document Structure Extraction Using Bidirectional Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text segmentation holds paramount importance in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It plays an important role in several NLP downstream tasks like information retrieval and document summarization. In this work, we propose a new solution, namely TocBERT, for segmenting texts using bidirectional transformers. TocBERT represents a supervised solution trained on the detection of titles and sub-titles from their semantic representations. This task was formulated as a named entity recognition (NER) problem. The solution has been applied on a medical text segmentation use-case where the Bio-ClinicalBERT model is fine-tuned to segment discharge summaries of the MIMIC-III dataset. The performance of TocBERT has been evaluated on a human-labeled ground truth corpus of 250 notes. It achieved an F1-score of 84.6% when evaluated on a linear text segmentation problem and 72.8% on a hierarchical text segmentation problem. It outperformed a carefully designed rule-based solution, particularly in distinguishing titles from subtitles.</description>

      <title>Interactive Topic Models with Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topic models are widely used to analyze document collections. While they are valuable for discovering latent topics in a corpus when analysts are unfamiliar with the corpus, analysts also commonly start with an understanding of the content present in a corpus. This may be through categories obtained from an initial pass over the corpus or a desire to analyze the corpus through a predefined set of categories derived from a high level theoretical framework (e.g. political ideology). In these scenarios analysts desire a topic modeling approach which incorporates their understanding of the corpus while supporting various forms of interaction with the model. In this work, we present EdTM, as an approach for label name supervised topic modeling. EdTM models topic modeling as an assignment problem while leveraging LM/LLM based document-topic affinities and using optimal transport for making globally coherent topic-assignments. In experiments, we show the efficacy of our framework compared to few-shot LLM classifiers, and topic models based on clustering and LDA. Further, we show EdTM's ability to incorporate various forms of analyst feedback and while remaining robust to noisy analyst inputs.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Neural Framework for Classification and its Explanation in Large Unstructured Legal Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic legal judgment prediction and its explanation suffer from the problem of long case documents exceeding tens of thousands of words, in general, and having a non-uniform structure. Predicting judgments from such documents and extracting their explanation becomes a challenging task, more so on documents with no structural annotation. We define this problem as "scarce annotated legal documents" and explore their lack of structural information and their long lengths with a deep-learning-based classification framework which we call MESc; "Multi-stage Encoder-based Supervised with-clustering"; for judgment prediction. We explore the adaptability of LLMs with multi-billion parameters (GPT-Neo, and GPT-J) to legal texts and their intra-domain(legal) transfer learning capacity. Alongside this, we compare their performance and adaptability with MESc and the impact of combining embeddings from their last layers. For such hierarchical models, we also propose an explanation extraction algorithm named ORSE; Occlusion sensitivity-based Relevant Sentence Extractor; based on the input-occlusion sensitivity of the model, to explain the predictions with the most relevant sentences from the document. We explore these methods and test their effectiveness with extensive experiments and ablation studies on legal documents from India, the European Union, and the United States with the ILDC dataset and a subset of the LexGLUE dataset. MESc achieves a minimum total performance gain of approximately 2 points over previous state-of-the-art proposed methods, while ORSE applied on MESc achieves a total average gain of 50% over the baseline explainability scores.</description>

      <title>GRILLBot In Practice: Lessons and Tradeoffs Deploying Large Language Models for Adaptable Conversational Task Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of building real-world multimodal assistants for complex real-world tasks. We describe the practicalities and challenges of developing and deploying GRILLBot, a leading (first and second prize winning in 2022 and 2023) system deployed in the Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge. Building on our Open Assistant Toolkit (OAT) framework, we propose a hybrid architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialised models tuned for specific subtasks requiring very low latency. OAT allows us to define when, how and which LLMs should be used in a structured and deployable manner. For knowledge-grounded question answering and live task adaptations, we show that LLM reasoning abilities over task context and world knowledge outweigh latency concerns. For dialogue state management, we implement a code generation approach and show that specialised smaller models have 84% effectiveness with 100x lower latency. Overall, we provide insights and discuss tradeoffs for deploying both traditional models and LLMs to users in complex real-world multimodal environments in the Alexa TaskBot challenge. These experiences will continue to evolve as LLMs become more capable and efficient -- fundamentally reshaping OAT and future assistant architectures.</description>

      <title>Transparency, Privacy, and Fairness in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems have become a pervasive part of our daily online experience, and are one of the most widely used applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Therefore, regulations and requirements for trustworthy artificial intelligence, for example, the European AI Act, which includes notions such as transparency, privacy, and fairness are also highly relevant for the design of recommender systems in practice. This habilitation elaborates on aspects related to these three notions in the light of recommender systems, namely: (i) transparency and cognitive models, (ii) privacy and limited preference information, and (iii) fairness and popularity bias in recommender systems. Specifically, with respect to aspect (i), we highlight the usefulness of incorporating psychological theories for a transparent design process of recommender systems. We term this type of systems psychology-informed recommender systems. In aspect (ii), we study and address the trade-off between accuracy and privacy in differentially-private recommendations. We design a novel recommendation approach for collaborative filtering based on an efficient neighborhood reuse concept, which reduces the number of users that need to be protected with differential privacy. Furthermore, we address the related issue of limited availability of user preference information, e.g., click data, in the settings of session-based and cold-start recommendations. With respect to aspect (iii), we analyze popularity bias in recommender systems. We find that the recommendation frequency of an item is positively correlated with this item's popularity. This also leads to the unfair treatment of users with little interest in popular content. Finally, we study long-term fairness dynamics in algorithmic decision support in the labor market using agent-based modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>GEO: Generative Engine Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new paradigm of search engines that use generative models to gather and summarize information to answer user queries. This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improves $\textit{user}$ utility and $\textit{generative search engine}$ traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over $\textit{when}$ and $\textit{how}$ their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to $40\%$ in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.</description>

      <title>JMLR: Joint Medical LLM and Retrieval Training for Enhancing Reasoning and Professional Question Answering Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17887v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable potential in medical knowledge acquisition and question-answering. However, LLMs can potentially hallucinate and yield factually incorrect outcomes, even with domain-specific pretraining. Previously, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has limited success in addressing hallucinations. Unlike previous methods in RAG where the retrieval model was trained separately from the LLM, we introduce JMLR (for Jointly trains LLM and information Retrieval) during the fine-tuning phase. The synchronized training mechanism enhances JMLR's ability to retrieve clinical guidelines and leverage medical knowledge to reason and answer questions and reduces the demand for computational resources. We evaluated JMLR on the important medical question-answering application. Our experimental results demonstrate that JMLR-13B (70.5%) outperforms a previous state-of-the-art open-source model using conventional pre-training and fine-tuning Meditron-70B (68.9%) and Llama2-13B with RAG (67.7%) on a medical question-answering dataset. Comprehensive evaluations reveal JMLR-13B enhances reasoning quality and reduces hallucinations better than Claude3-Opus. Additionally, JMLR-13B (148 GPU hours) also trains much faster than Meditron-70B (42630 GPU hours). Through this work, we provide a new and efficient knowledge enhancement method for healthcare, demonstrating the potential of integrating retrieval and LLM training for medical question-answering systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent successes in virtual screening have been made possible by large models and extensive chemical libraries. However, combining these elements is challenging: the larger the model, the more expensive it is to run, making ultra-large libraries unfeasible. To address this, we developed a target-agnostic, efficacy-based molecule search model, which allows us to find structurally dissimilar molecules with similar biological activities. We used the best practices to design fast retrieval system, based on processor-optimized SIMD instructions, enabling us to screen the ultra-large 40B Enamine REAL library with 100\% recall rate. We extensively benchmarked our model and several state-of-the-art models for both speed performance and retrieval quality of novel molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual question answering lack in visual grounding and complexity, particularly in evaluating spatial reasoning skills. We introduce FlowVQA, a novel benchmark aimed at assessing the capabilities of visual question-answering multimodal language models in reasoning with flowcharts as visual contexts. FlowVQA comprises 2,272 carefully generated and human-verified flowchart images from three distinct content sources, along with 22,413 diverse question-answer pairs, to test a spectrum of reasoning tasks, including information localization, decision-making, and logical progression. We conduct a thorough baseline evaluation on a suite of both open-source and proprietary multimodal language models using various strategies, followed by an analysis of directional bias. The results underscore the benchmark's potential as a vital tool for advancing the field of multimodal modeling, providing a focused and challenging environment for enhancing model performance in visual and logical reasoning tasks.</description>
