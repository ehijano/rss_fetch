      <title>The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Crisis: Implications on Antidepressant Access for Low-Income Americans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression affects more than 280 million people worldwide, with poorer communities having disproportionate burden as well as barriers to treatment. This study examines the role of pharmacy pricing caps in access to antidepressants among poorer Americans through bibliometric analysis of the 100 most cited articles on antidepressant pricing and access in the Web of Science Core Collection. We used tools like Bibliometrix and VOSviewer to visualize publication trends, dominant contributors, thematic clusters, and citation networks in the literature. Findings highlight intransigent inequalities in access to antidepressants based on astronomically high drug pricing as well as systemic inequalities against racial and ethnic minorities in particular. Branded antidepressant high prices are associated with low initiation of therapy as well as regimen compliance, heightened mental illness outcomes, as well as increased health utilization. This work uncovers critical gaps in the literature and demands immediate policy action to make antidepressants affordable as well as appropriately accessible to marginalized communities.</description>

      <title>Identifying economic narratives in large text corpora -- An integrated approach using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts. Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling. Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs to pursue similar objectives.</description>

      <title>How does online shopping affect offline price sensitivity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise of e-commerce has transformed consumer behavior, prompting questions about how online adoption influences offline shopping. We examine whether consumers who adopt online shopping with a retailer become more price-sensitive in their subsequent offline purchases with that retailer. Using transaction-level data from a large Brazilian pet supplies retailer operating both online and offline, we compare ''adopters'' - customers who began shopping online after a period of offline-only purchasing - with ''non-adopters'' who remained offline-only. We estimate a discrete choice logit model with individual-level heterogeneity, using a novel algorithm to handle high-dimensional fixed effects and address price endogeneity. We then apply a staggered difference-in-differences approach to the estimated price elasticities and obtain the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). We find that offline price sensitivity increases significantly after online adoption in three out of four product categories, particularly in items with low switching costs, such as pet hygiene. Counterfactual pricing simulations show that incorporating these behavioral spillovers into pricing strategies can increase firm profits by up to 4.1%. These results underscore the importance of recognizing cross-channel effects in consumer behavior and contribute to the literature on pricing and multichannel retailing by identifying online adoption as a key driver of offline price sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The Economic Value of Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to introduce an economic perspective in the social logic of space. Firstly, we describe the economic model of a linear city to show how depth can generate value by creating local monopolies in less integrated spaces. Then, a new syntactic measure, the d-value, is proposed to capture the relation between the depth of some space from outside and the mean depth of all spaces from outside. An application to a public housing estate suggests that economic activities and services may be located in spaces with a d-value close to one. The article is complemented by a Prolog programme with a special predicate to compute the d-value.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Gotthard Base Tunnel on Road Traffic: A Synthetic Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The opening of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in 2017, the longest railway tunnel in the world, marked a milestone in Swiss transport policy. The tunnel, a part of the New Rail Link through the Alps, serves as a key instrument of the so-called "modal shift policy," which aims to transfer transalpine freight traffic from road to rail. The reduction in travel time by train between northern and southern Switzerland raised expectations that a substantial share of tourist-oriented passenger traffic would also shift from car to rail. In this paper, we conduct a causal analysis of the impact of the Gotthard Base Tunnel's opening at the end of 2016 on the number of cars using the parallel Gotthard motorway section in the subsequent years. To this end, we apply the synthetic control and the synthetic difference-in-differences methods to construct a synthetic Gotthard motorway section based on a weighted combination of other alpine road crossings (a so-called donor pool) that did not experience the construction of a competing rail infrastructure. Our results reveal only a modest but statistically significant decline in the number of cars between the actual and the synthetic Gotthard motorway in the short run. Given the consistently strong and increasing demand for the new rail connection through the Gotthard Base Tunnel, we infer a substantial induced short-run demand effect resulting from the rail travel time savings.</description>

      <title>"Generate" the Future of Work through AI: Empirical Evidence from Online Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT, demonstrate zero-shot learning capabilities across a wide range of downstream tasks. Owing to their general-purpose nature and potential to augment or even automate job functions, these systems are poised to reshape labor market dynamics. However, predicting their precise impact \textit{a priori} is challenging, given AI's simultaneous effects on both demand and supply, as well as the strategic responses of market participants. Leveraging an extensive dataset from a leading online labor platform, we document a pronounced displacement effect and an overall contraction in submarkets where required skills closely align with core LLM functionalities. Although demand and supply both decline, the reduction in supply is comparatively smaller, thereby intensifying competition among freelancers. Notably, further analysis shows that this heightened competition is especially pronounced in programming-intensive submarkets. This pattern is attributed to skill-transition effects: by lowering the human-capital barrier to programming, ChatGPT enables incumbent freelancers to enter programming tasks. Moreover, these transitions are not homogeneous, with high-skilled freelancers contributing disproportionately to the shift. Our findings illuminate the multifaceted impacts of general-purpose AI on labor markets, highlighting not only the displacement of certain occupations but also the inducement of skill transitions within the labor supply. These insights offer practical implications for policymakers, platform operators, and workers.</description>

      <title>The Surprising Irrelevance of Total-Value-Locked on Cryptocurrency Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common assumption in cryptocurrency markets is a positive relationship between total-value-locked (TVL) and cryptocurrency returns. To test this hypothesis we examine whether the returns of TVL-sorted portfolios can be explained by common cryptocurrency factors. We find evidence that portfolios formed on TVL exhibit returns that are linear functions of aggregate crypto market returns, that is they can be replicated with appropriate weights on the crypto market portfolio. Thus, strategies based on TVL can be priced with standard asset pricing tools. This result holds true both for total TVL and a simple TVL measure that removes a number of ways TVL may be overstated.</description>
