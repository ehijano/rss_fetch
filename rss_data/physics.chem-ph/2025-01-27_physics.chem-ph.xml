      <title>On the Estimation of Centre of Mass in Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculation of the centre of mass of a group of particles in a periodically-repeating cell is an important aspect of chemical and physical simulation. One popular approach, described by Bai and Breen, calculates the centre of mass via the projection of the individual particles' coordinates onto a circle. This approach, which is mathematically equivalent to finding the first moment of the Fourier series of the mass density, suffers from some numerical error. Here we discuss this inaccuracy and propose an extension that overcomes it, enabling improved accuracy across computational simulation.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear X-ray spectra of chiral molecules: X-ray Circular Dichroism, Sum- and Difference-Frequency Generation of fenchone and cysteine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in X-ray light sources at synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) present exciting opportunities to probe molecular chirality using novel nonlinear spectroscopies with element-sensitivity. Circular dichroism (CD) and sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG/DFG) are established techniques for probing molecular asymmetry in optical regime, with SFG/DFG offering unique advantages due to their background-free nature and independence from circularly polarized light sources. Extending them into the X-ray domain provides deeper insights into local structural asymmetries by leveraging the localized nature of core orbitals. In this work, we simulate X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray circular dichroism (XCD) and nonlinear optical/X-ray SFG and DFG (OX SFG/DFG) signals for two prototypical chiral molecules, fenchone and cysteine. Our multi-reference simulations reproduce experimental data when available and reveal how novel X-ray spectroscopies exploit the site- and element-sensitivity of X-rays to uncover molecular asymmetry. The XCD spectra show strong asymmetries at chiral centers, while distant atoms contribute less. The OX SFG/DFG signals, under fixed resonant optical excitation, strongly depend on core transition and valence excitation energies. This dependence allows us to introduce two-dimensional (2D) chirality-sensitive valence-core spectroscopy, which provides insight into the overlap between valence orbitals and local molecular asymmetry. Finally, our estimates using realistic laser and X-ray pulse parameters demonstrate that such nonlinear experiments are feasible at XFELs, offering a promising tool for investigating the geometric and electronic structures of chiral molecules.</description>

      <title>Non-selective evaporation mechanism of binary aerosol generating agent on porous atomizer and its experimental verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explain the similarity between e-cigarette aerosol and e-liquid composition despite differing component boiling points, a non-selective evaporation mechanism for binary aerosol generating agents was investigated using phase diagrams and capillary evaporation theory. Experiments including evaporation temperature measurement, airflow heating, and capillary evaporation observation validated the non-selective evaporation process. Key findings: 1) Non-selective evaporation occurs due to liquid convection obstruction in capillaries, forming an evaporation layer with a composition distinct from the main liquid phase. Stable non-selective evaporation arises when the gas-phase composition matches the liquid-phase components transferred to the evaporation layer. 2) Evaporation temperature (T) deviated significantly from the bubble point temperature (Tb) and aligned closely with the dew point temperature (Tc), indicating a stable evaporation layer with a unique composition. 3) Surface heating and porous material experiments demonstrated significant deviations from ideal selective evaporation in water/methanol, water/propylene glycol, and propylene glycol/glycerol systems, highlighting the roles of "surface heating" and "mass transfer resistance" in non-selective evaporation. 4) A two-stage capillary evaporation experiment revealed a transition in evaporation rate, confirming a shift in the evaporation layer's composition during stable non-selective evaporation. 5) Particle tracing confirmed unidirectional liquid flow in capillaries, with micro-convection near the meniscus, further supporting the "evaporation layer" concept. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of non-selective evaporation in e-cigarette aerosols.</description>

      <title>Polarizable Water Model with Ab Initio Neural Network Dynamic Charges and Spontaneous Charge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating water accurately has been a challenge due to the complexity of describing polarization and intermolecular charge transfer. Quantum mechanical (QM) electronic structures provide an accurate description of polarization in response to local environments, which is nevertheless too expensive for large water systems. In this study, we have developed a polarizable water model integrating Charge Model 5 atomic charges at the level of second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, predicted by an accurate and transferable Charge Neural Network (ChargeNN) model. The spontaneous intermolecular charge transfer has been explicitly accounted for, enabling a precise treatment of hydrogen bonds and out-of-plane polarization. Our ChargeNN water model successfully reproduces various properties of water in gas, liquid and solid phases. For example, ChargeNN correctly captures the hydrogen-bond stretching peak and bending-libration combination band, which are absent in the spectra using fixed charges, highlighting the significance of accurate polarization and charge transfer. Finally, the molecular dynamical simulations using ChargeNN for liquid water and a large water droplet with a $\sim$4.5 nm radius reveal that the strong interfacial electric fields are concurrently induced by the partial collapse of the hydrogen-bond network and surface-to-interior charge transfer. Our study paves the way for QM-polarizable force fields, aiming for large-scale molecular simulations with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Parallel Multi-Coordinate Descent Methods for Full Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a multi-threaded parallel coordinate descent full configuration interaction algorithm (mCDFCI), for the electronic structure ground-state calculation in the configuration interaction framework. The FCI problem is reformulated as an unconstrained minimization problem, and tackled by a modified block coordinate descent method with a deterministic compression strategy. mCDFCI is designed to prioritize determinants based on their importance, with block updates enabling efficient parallelization on shared-memory, multi-core computing infrastructure. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm by computing an accurate benchmark energy for the chromium dimer in the Ahlrichs SV basis (48e, 42o), which explicitly includes $2.07 \times 10^9$ variational determinants. We also provide the binding curve of the nitrogen dimer under the cc-pVQZ basis set (14e, 110o). Benchmarks show up to $79.3\%$ parallel efficiency on 128 cores.</description>

      <title>Encapsulation-Induced Alignment in Endofullerenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods for creating endofullerenes have been steadily improving since their discovery, allowing for new types of endofullerenes to be created in larger numbers. When a molecule is trapped in a fullerene, the fullerene creates a harmonic trapping potential that leaves most of the fundamental properties of the internal molecule intact. The fullerene cage does create a preferred axis for the internal molecule, which we refer to as the encapsulation-induced alignment of the molecule. We explore the alignment of AlF and N2 inside of C60 by first computing the interaction between the internal molecule and the fullerene cage using ab initio electronic structure methods. Our results show that the internal molecules are found to be strongly aligned despite finding that all the calculated spectroscopic constants are relatively unaffected by the fullerene cage.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory and simulations across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

      <title>Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01068v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic energy levels in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of the training process, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>
