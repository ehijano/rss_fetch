      <title>Long-term behavior of casino games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the ratio of total return (or total profit) to total amount bet in a casino game. While the limit is well understood when the sequence of wagers is independent and identically distributed, here we consider the case in which bet sizes vary over time and may depend on past outcomes. We propose a general framework that yields such results under mild conditions on the conditional expectations of bets, returns, and profits. The set-up applies to many casino games (including compound games and those in which wagers are not immediately resolved), expressing the long-term behavior in terms of intrinsic parameters, namely return to player (RTP) and house advantage (HA). As an application, we examine the roulette win documented in Leigh's (1976) Thirteen against the Bank and attempt to quantify the likelihood that the story is true.</description>

      <title>Minimax Duality in Game-Theoretic Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game-theoretic probability uses the structure of gambles to define a concept like probability, but which is more flexible and robust. We show that results in game-theoretic probability can be thought of as minimax theorems for specific zero-sum games between two players, Gambler and World. The traditional measure-theoretic versions arise when World must play first. This perspective suggests the possibility of a more general minimax theorem from which a wide array of game-theoretic results would follow. After developing a new framing of game-theoretic probability via gamble spaces, we prove such a theorem for finite time. Applying this minimax theorem to games derived from existing measure-theoretic statements, we prove several existing and novel game-theoretic statements. This general minimax theorem can be thought of as a composite Ville's theorem, as we discuss along with future directions.</description>

      <title>Boundary behavior of continuous-state interacting multi-type branching processes with immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study continuous-state interacting multi-type branching processes with immigration (CIMBI processes), where inter-specific interactions -- whether competitive, cooperative, or of a mixed type -- are proportional to the product of their type-population masses. We establish sufficient conditions for the CIMBI process to never hit the boundary $\partial\mathbb{R}_{+}^{d}$ when starting from the interior of $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{d}$. Additionally, we present two results concerning boundary attainment. In the first, we consider the diffusion case and prove that when the constant immigration rate is small and diffusion noise is present in each direction, the CIMBI process will almost surely hit the boundary $\partial\mathbb{R}_{+}^{d}$. In the second result, under similar conditions on the constant immigration rate and diffusion noise, but with jumps of finite activity, we show that the CIMBI process hits the boundary $\partial\mathbb{R}_{+}^{d}$ with positive probability.</description>

      <title>From multitype branching Brownian motions to branching Markov additive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of multitype branching L\'evy processes, where particles move according to type-dependent L\'evy processes, switch types via an irreducible Markov chain, and branch according to type-dependent laws. This framework generalizes multitype branching Brownian motions.
  Using techniques of Markov additive processes, we develop a spine decomposition. This approach further enables us to prove convergence results for the additive martingales and derivative martingales, and establish the existence and uniqueness of travelling wave solutions to the corresponding multitype FKPP equations. In particular, applying our results to the on-off branching Brownian motion model resolves several open problems posed by Blath et al.(2025).</description>

Abstract: By using the weak convergence method, we establish the large and moderate deviation principles for the multivalued McKean-Vlasov SDEs with non-Lipschitz coefficients driven by L\'{e}vy noise in this paper.

      <title>Win rates at first-passage times for biased simple random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the win rate $R_{N_d}/N_d$ of a biased simple random walk $S_n$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ at the first-passage time $N_d=\inf\{n\ge 0:S_n=d\}$, with $p=P[X_1=+1]\in[1/2,1)$. Using generating-function techniques and integral representations, we derive explicit formulas for the expectation and variance of $R_{N_d}/N_d$ along with monotonicity properties in the threshold $d$ and the bias $p$. We also provide closed-form expressions and use them to design unbiased coin-flipping estimators of $\pi$ based on first-passage sampling; the resulting schemes illustrate how biasing the coin can dramatically improve both approximation accuracy and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Marginal flows of non-entropic weak Schr\"odinger bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dynamic formulation of divergence-regularized optimal transport with weak targets on the path space. In our formulation, the classical relative entropy penalty is replaced by a general convex divergence, and terminal constraints are imposed in a weak sense. We establish well-posedness and a convex dual formulation of the problem, together with explicit structural characterizations of primal and dual optimizers. Specifically, the optimal path measure is shown to admit an explicit density relative to a reference diffusion, generalizing the classical Schr\"odinger system. For the pure Schr\"odinger case, i.e., when the transport cost is zero, we further characterize the flow of time marginals of the optimal bridge, recovering known results in the entropic setting and providing new descriptions for non-entropic divergences including the chi-divergence.</description>

      <title>Mixing time of the random walk on the giant component of the random geometric graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random geometric graph obtained by placing a Poisson point process of intensity 1 in the d-dimensional torus of side length n^(1/d) and connecting two points by an edge if their distance is at most r. We consider the case of d&gt;=2 and r in [r_min, r_max], where r_min&lt;r_max are any constants with r_min&gt;r_g and r_g is a constant above which this graph has a giant component with high probability. We show that, with high probability, the mixing time and the relaxation time of the simple random walk on the giant component in this case are both of order n^(2/d) and that therefore there is no cutoff. We also obtain bounds for the isoperimetric profile of subsets of the giant component of at least polylogarithmic size.</description>

      <title>Learning from Neighbors with PHIBP: Predicting Infectious Disease Dynamics in Data-Sparse Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.</description>

      <title>Understanding Scaling Laws in Deep Neural Networks via Feature Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to scaling laws that predict consistent gains as model, data, and compute grow; however, large models can exhibit training instability and diminishing returns, suggesting that scaling laws describe what success looks like but not when and why scaling succeeds or fails. A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.</description>

      <title>Modeling gap acceptance behavior allowing for perceptual distortions and exogenous influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work on gap acceptance is based on the premise that the decision to accept/reject a gap happens in a person's mind and therefore must be based on the perceived gap and not the measured gap. The critical gap must also exist in a person's mind and hence, together with the perceived gap, is a latent variable. Finally, it is also proposed that the critical gap is influenced by various exogenous variables such as subject and opposing vehicle types, and perceived waiting time. Mathematical models that (i) incorporate systematic and random distortions during the perception process and (ii) account for the effect of the various influencing variables are developed. The parameters of these models are estimated for two different gap acceptance data sets using the maximum likelihood technique. The data is collected as part of this study. The estimated parameters throw valuable insights into how these influencing variables affect the critical gap. The results corroborate the initial predictions on the nature of influence these variables must exert and give strength to the gap acceptance decision-making construct proposed here. This work also proposes a methodology to estimate a measurable/observable world emulator of the latent variable critical gap. The use of the emulator critical gap provides improved estimates of derived quantities like the average waiting time of subject vehicles. Finally, studies are also conducted to show that the number of rejected gaps can work as a reasonable surrogate for the influencing variable, waiting time.</description>

      <title>Closed-form empirical Bernstein confidence sequences for scalars and matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a new closed-form variance-adaptive confidence sequence (CS) for estimating the average conditional mean of a sequence of bounded random variables. Empirically, it yields the tightest closed-form CS we have found for tracking time-varying means, across sample sizes up to $\approx 10^6$. When the observations happen to have the same conditional mean, our CS is asymptotically tighter than the recent closed-form CS of Waudby-Smith and Ramdas [38]. It also has other desirable properties: it is centered at the unweighted sample mean and has limiting width (multiplied by $\sqrt{t/\log t}$) independent of the significance level. We extend our results to provide a CS with the same properties for random matrices with bounded eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Explicit numerical approximations for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations in finite and infinite time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the stochastic particle method, this paper establishes an easily implementable explicit numerical method for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs) with superlinear growth coefficients. The paper establishes the theory on the propagation of chaos in the Lq sense. The optimal uniform-in-time strong convergence rate 1/2-order of the numerical solutions is obtained for the interacting particle system. Furthermore, it is proved that the numerical solutions capture the long-term dynamical behaviors of MV-SDEs precisely, including moment boundedness, stability, and ergodicity. Moreover, a unique numerical invariant probability measure is yielded, which converges to the underlying invariant probability measure of MV-SDEs in the L2-Wasserstein distance. Finally, several numerical experiments are carried out to support the main results.</description>

      <title>Pointwise explicit estimates for derivatives of solutions to linear parabolic PDEs with Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive explicit pointwise bounds for the spatial derivative $\left| \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} \right|$ of solutions to linear parabolic PDEs with Neumann boundary conditions. The bound is fully explicit in the sense that it depends only on the coefficients of the PDE and the domain, including closed-form expression for all constants. The proof is purely probabilistic. We first extend to time inhomogeneous diffusions a result concerning the derivative of the solution of a reflected SDE. Then, we combine it with the spectral expansion of the law of the first hitting time to a boundary for a reflected diffusion. The main motivation comes from optimal control where, in order to apply verification theorems, precise gradient estimates are often required when closed-form solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This result will be used in a forthcoming work to rigorously prove that the conjectured optimal strategy for the sailboat trajectory optimization problem is indeed optimal far from the buoy. We also state a sufficient condition for $\limsup_{t\rightarrow \infty} \left| \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}(t,x) \right|$ to be bounded, which only involves the coefficients of the problem and the first eigenvalue of the spectral expansion.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limits of Line Models in Degenerate Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a 2-dimensional model of random walk in random environment known as line model. The environment is described by two independent families of i.i.d. random variables dictating rates of jumps in vertical, respectively horizontal directions, and whose values are constant along vertical, respect. horizontal lines. When jump rates are heavy-tailed in one of the directions, we prove that the random walk becomes superdiffusive in that direction, with an explicit scaling limit written as a two-dimensional Brownian motion time-changed (in one of the components) by a process introduced by Kesten and Spitzer in 1979. In the case of a fully degenerate environment, a sufficient condition for non-explosion is provided, and conjectures on the associated scaling limit are formulated.</description>

      <title>Koenigs functions in the subcritical and critical Markov branching processes with Poisson probability reproduction of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Special functions have always played a central role in physics and in mathematics, arising as solutions of nonlinear differential equations, as well as in the theory of branching processes, which extensively uses probability generating functions. The theory of iteration of real functions leads to limit theorems for the discrete-time and real-time Markov branching processes. The Poisson reproduction of particles in real time is analysed through the integration of the Kolmogorov equation. These results are further extended by employing graphical representations of Koenigs functions under subcritical and critical branching mechanisms. The limit conditional law in the subcritical case and the invariant measure for the critical case are discussed, as well. The obtained explicit solutions contain the exponential Bell polynomials and the modified exponential-integral function $\rm{Ein} (z)$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control Problems Motivated by Sailboat Trajectory Optimization</title>

Abstract: We develop a mathematical model for sailboat navigation that can play the same role that the Black and Scholes model plays in mathematical finance: it captures essential features of sailboat navigation, it can provide insights that might not be available otherwise, and it is a source of interesting mathematical problems. In our model, the motion of the sailboat, which would travel at speed $v&gt;0$ in a constant wind, is the solution of a system of two stochastic differential equations driven by a Brownian motion on a circle with speed $\sigma &gt; 0$. We formulate two stochastic control problems, in which the objective is to reach a circular upwind target of radius $\eta \geq 0$ as quickly as possible. In the first problem, there is a tacking cost $c &gt; 0$, while in the second problem, we assume that $c=0$. We establish the viability of both models (assuming that $\eta &gt; 0$ in the second model), that is, their value functions are finite, and we obtain bounds on these value functions related to the parameters of the problem. The first problem falls into the class of impulse control problems, while the second one involves singular controls. In this second case, since the state equation for the optimally controlled motion has discontinuous coefficients and is driven by a degenerate diffusion, standard results on existence and uniqueness of strong solutions do not apply, and we provide a proof via the Yamada-Watanabe argument.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Universality, Low-Degree Polynomials, and Max-Cut in Sparse Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universality, namely distributional invariance, is a well-known property for many random structures. For example, it is known to hold for a broad range of variational problems with random input. Much less is known about the algorithmic universality of specific methods for solving such variational problems. Namely, whether algorithms tuned to specific variational tasks produce the same asymptotic behavior across different input distributions with matching moments.
  In this paper, we establish algorithmic universality for a class of models, which includes spin glass models and constraint satisfaction problems on sparse graphs, provided that an algorithm can be coded as a low-degree polynomial (LDP). We illustrate this specifically for the case of the Max-Cut problem in sparse Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n,d/n)$. We use the fact that the Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, which is an effective algorithm for finding near-ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, is well approximated by an LDP. We then establish our main universality result: the performance of the LDP based algorithms exhibiting a certain connectivity property, is the same in the mean-field (SK) and in the random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,d/n)$ setting, up to an appropriate rescaling. The main technical challenge we address in this paper is showing that the output of an LDP algorithm on $\mathbb{G}(n,d/n)$ is truly discrete, namely, that it is close to the set of points in the binary cube. This is achieved by establishing universality of coordinate-wise statistics of the LDP output across disorder ensembles, which implies that proximity to the cube transfers from the Gaussian to the sparse graph setting.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional double-spending attack models ignore the revenue losses stemming from the orphan blocks. On the other hand, selfish mining literature usually ignores the chance of the attacker to double-spend at no-cost in each attack cycle. In this paper, we give a rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack where the goal of the adversary is to double-spend while mining selfishly. To do so, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, the adversary gets a free shot at double-spending. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the probability of double-spending is. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Inference Time Scaling for Solving High-Dimensional PDE via Defect Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is a critical challenge where modern data-driven solvers often lack reliability and rigorous error guarantees. We introduce Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning (SCaSML), a framework that systematically improves pre-trained PDE solvers at inference time without any retraining. Our core idea is to use defect correction method that derive a new PDE, termed Structural-preserving Law of Defect, that precisely describes the error of a given surrogate model. Since it retains the structure of the original problem, we can solve it efficiently with traditional stochastic simulators and correct the initial machine-learned solution. We prove that SCaSML achieves a faster convergence rate, with a final error bounded by the product of the surrogate and simulation errors. On challenging PDEs up to 160 dimensions, SCaSML reduces the error of various surrogate models, including PINNs and Gaussian Processes, by 20-80%. Code of SCaSML is available at https://github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantization on Spherical Surfaces: Continuous and Discrete Models -- A Beginner-Friendly Expository Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This expository paper provides a unified and pedagogical introduction to optimal quantization for probability measures supported on spherical curves and discrete subsets of the sphere, emphasizing both continuous and discrete settings. We first present a detailed geometric and analytical foundation for intrinsic quantization on the unit sphere, including definitions of great and small circles, spherical triangles, geodesic distance, Slerp interpolation, the Frechet mean, spherical Voronoi regions, centroid conditions, and quantization dimensions. Building upon this framework, we develop explicit continuous and discrete quantization models on spherical curves, namely great circles, small circles, and great circular arcs supported by rigorous derivations and pedagogical exposition. For uniform continuous distributions, we compute optimal sets of $n$-means and the associated quantization errors on these curves; for discrete distributions, we analyze antipodal, equatorial, tetrahedral, and finite uniform configurations, illustrating convergence to the continuous model. The central conclusion is that for a uniform probability distribution supported on a one-dimensional geodesic subset of total length $L$, the optimal $n$-means form a uniform partition and the quantization error satisfies $V_n = L^2/(12n^2)$. The exposition emphasizes geometric intuition, detailed derivations, and clear step-by-step reasoning, making it accessible to beginning graduate students and researchers entering the study of quantization on manifolds. This article is intended as an expository and tutorial contribution, with the main emphasis on geometric reformulation and pedagogical clarity of intrinsic quantization on spherical curves, rather than on the development of new asymptotic quantization theory.</description>

      <title>Invariance of the Hausdorff Dimension of McMullen-Bedford Carpets under Coordinate Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a generalization of the self-affine carpets of Bedford and McMullen where the defining iterated function system includes coordinate reflections. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension is invariant under such reflections. The argument is framed within a probabilistic context, utilizing the thermodynamic formalism for self-affine measures. We derive the upper bound using the standard covering argument and the lower bound via the variational principle and the Ledrappier-Young formula. A key step in our analysis is the rigorous treatment of the symbolic factor entropy associated with the projection onto the less contracted coordinate. We demonstrate that this entropic quantity is invariant under the action of the reflection group, provided the grid structure satisfies the Strong Separation Condition. We provide a complete derivation of the dimension formula, optimizing the dimension over Bernoulli measures on the symbolic space.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations arising in Consensus-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the mean-field description of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), a derivative-free particle optimization method. Such a description is provided by a non-local SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, whose fields lack of global Lipschitz continuity. We propose a novel approach to prove the well-posedness of the mean-field CBO equation based on a truncation argument. The latter is performed through the introduction of a cut-off function, defined on the space of probability measures, acting on the fields. This procedure allows us to study the well-posedness problem in the classical framework of Sznitman. Through this argument, we recover the established result on the existence of strong solutions, and we extend the class of solutions for which pathwise uniqueness holds.</description>
