      <title>High-energy radiation from the pulsar Equatorial Current Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars emit beams of radiation that reveal the extreme physics of neutron star magnetospheres. Yet, their understanding remains incomplete. Recent global Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations have raised several questions that led us to question their validity and their extrapolation to realistic particle Lorentz factors, electric and magnetic fields. We want to generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation from first principles. We propose a novel method to study the Equatorial Current Sheet (ECS) where most of the particle acceleration and the high-energy radiation is expected to originate. We first determine its shape and external magnetic field with a steady-state ideal force-free solution. Then, we consider the extra electric and magnetic field components that develop when dissipation is considered. Finally, we study the particle acceleration and radiation that is due to these extra field components for realistic field and particle parameters. We generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation and compare them with those obtained via PIC simulations. These sky maps may also be closely reproduced using the ECS of the split-monopole solution beyond the light cylinder. The ECS is probably stabilized by the normal magnetic field component that is due to the global magnetospheric reconnection. Our method helps us better understand the origin of the pulsed high-energy radiation in the pulsar magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>From Observations to Simulations: A Neural-Network Approach to Intracluster Medium Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison between {\it XMM-Newton} velocity maps of the Virgo, Centaurus, Ophiuchus and A3266 clusters and synthetic velocity maps generated from the Illustris TNG-300 simulations. Our goal is to constrain the physical conditions and dynamical states of the intracluster medium (ICM) through a data-driven approach. We employ a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify the most analogous simulated cluster to each observed system based on the morphology of their line-of-sight velocity maps. The model learns a high-dimensional similarity metric between observations and simulations, allowing us to capture subtle kinematic and structural patterns beyond traditional statistical tests. We find that the best-matching simulated halos reproduce the observed large-scale velocity gradients and local kinematic substructures, suggesting that the ICM motions in these clusters arise from a combination of gas sloshing, AGN feedback, and minor merger activity. Our results demonstrate that deep learning provides a powerful and objective framework for connecting X-ray observations to cosmological simulations, offering new insights into the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters and the mechanisms driving turbulence and bulk flows in the hot ICM.</description>

      <title>High-Order Photon Rings around Kerr Naked Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of higher-order photon rings of an accreting Kerr naked singularity (KNS) with dimensionless spin parameter $a=1.01$; i.e., a horizonless, overly spinning compact object. Motivated by horizon-scale very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and future missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), we analyze image morphology and interferometric visibilities to identify observational signatures that differentiate KNS from Kerr black holes. We find that higher-order photon rings are tightly concentrated within the nominal ``shadow'' region and that the shadow develops a pronounced gap at sufficiently large observer inclination. These morphological differences produce measurable deviations in the complex visibilities relative to Kerr black hole predictions. Our results indicate that photon-ring structure and visibility-domain diagnostics at horizon-resolving baselines can provide a direct observational test of the presence (or absence) of an event horizon and thus offer a concrete avenue to test general relativity with future horizon-scale observations.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Fast-Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models: II. Quasi-Equipartition and the Impact of Various Angular Reconstruction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore in a consistent fashion the effects of fast flavor conversion (FFC) in 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. In addition, we investigate the impact of various angular reconstruction methods and compare the ``3-species'' and ``4-species'' neutrino transport schemes. We find that the FFC effects are insensitive to the different methods tested and that the FFC alters supernova hydrodynamics is only minor ways. We also present a ``quasi-equipartition'' approximation which can be used to estimate the FFC-altered neutrino properties by post-processing the neutrino signals extracted from no-oscillation CCSN simulations. The relative errors in neutrino number and energy luminosities of this phenomenological method are less than 2\% for 1D models, and less than 10\% for 2D models. This method provides a simple way to include the effects of FFC on neutrino signals without implementing a complex and expensive FFC scheme or redoing simulations.</description>

      <title>Is there a retrograde accretion disk around 4U 1626$-$67? Tracking torque reversals with a state-space model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray timing studies of the persistent, Galactic, accretion-powered pulsar 4U 1626$-$67 reveal torque reversals, during which the pulse frequency $\nu(t)$ alternates between multiyear episodes of secular acceleration and deceleration, separated by transitions lasting $\lesssim 150 \, \rm{days}$. Here an unscented Kalman filter is applied to track the $\nu(t)$ fluctuations observed in 22.7 years (3340 samples) of publicly available Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory and Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope data to test the canonical picture of magnetocentrifugal accretion for consistency with prograde-prograde and retrograde-prograde accretion disk configurations on either side of the 2008 torque reversal. It is found that the retrograde-prograde model is preferred, with a log Bayes factor equal to 0.44 and maximum a posteriori log likelihood ratio equal to 2.5. The mass accretion rate $Q(t)$ and magnetocentrifugal fastness $\omega(t)$ transition smoothly between episodes of deceleration and acceleration; $Q(t)$ shifts by $\leq 0.34 \, {\rm dex}$ across the reversal, and one measures $\omega(t) \approx 0.25$ and $\omega(t) \approx 0.30$ during deceleration and acceleration, respectively. The angular acceleration $\dot{\Omega}(t)$ satisfies $-9 \lesssim \dot{\Omega}(t)/(10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}) \lesssim -5$ and $2 \lesssim \dot{\Omega}(t)/(10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}) \lesssim 9$ before and after the 2008 reversal, respectively, compared to $\dot{\Omega} \approx -3.0 \times 10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}$ before reversal and $\dot{\Omega} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}$ after reversal, as inferred from previous long-term X-ray timing and spectral analysis of 4U 1626$-$67.</description>

      <title>The Intermediate Mass Black Hole in Omega Centauri: Constraints on Accretion from JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze JWST observations of the central region of the globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri (NGC 5139, $\omega$ Cen hereafter), around the position of the candidate IMBH inferred by Haberle et al. (2024a) from the motion of fast-moving stars in multi-epoch HST observations. We performed PSF-fitting photometry for sources in NIRCam (F200W and F444W) and MIRI (F770W and F1500W) and constructed UV to IR SEDs for sources within the central region of the cluster by using HST photometry from oMEGACat (Haberle et al. 2024b). None of the SEDs of reliably measured sources within this region resembles the SEDs computed from models of Pesce et al. 2021 for IMBHs accreting from intracluster medium at low rates. Our JWST limits place constraints on combinations of IMBH mass and accretion efficiency, either due to the amount of material available to be accreted, or due to the fraction of accreting matter that actually falls into the IMBH. Our non-detection then does not contradict the mass range of the IMBH inferred from the fast moving stars. We discuss these constraints in the context of the model of Pesce et al. 2021. We find that JWST limits are more restrictive than the existing radio limits for IMBH masses $\lesssim 20,000 M_{\odot}$. It is also possible that the faint IMBH emission is dominated by the light of a nearby star. Tighter limits on accretion onto the candidate IMBH can be placed with deeper observations, a more precise localization of the IMBH, and better measurements of the local intracluster medium density and temperature at the center of the cluster.</description>

      <title>The diverse morphology of gravitational wave signals from merging neutron-star white-dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sufficiently compact neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) binary systems, orbital decay means the white dwarf eventually fills its shrinking Roche lobe, initiating a phase of mass transfer. The exchange of angular momentum-both internal and external-plays a critical role in determining the binary's evolutionary outcome. For neutron stars with relatively low magnetic fields and spin frequencies, whether the orbital separation continues to shrink depends on the interplay between gravitational wave (GW) radiation and mass transfer dynamics. We compute the orbital evolution of NSWD binaries across a broad parameter space, incorporating four key variables. Our results reveal distinct boundaries in the NS-WD mass-mass diagram: binaries with white dwarf masses above these thresholds undergo rapid orbital decay and direct coalescence. The dependence of these boundaries on system parameters indicates that Roche-lobe-filling NSWD binaries can follow multiple evolutionary pathways -- a phenomenon we refer to as branched or polymorphic evolution. NSWD binary systems emit strong and diverse GW signals, many of which would be detectable by space-based GW observatories. The morphology of the evolving GW waveform provides a direct diagnostic for the NSWD binary configuration, including any contribution from an accretion disk. Our models can provide critical waveform templates for identifying merging binary signals in real-time GW data.</description>

      <title>Impact of Cosmic Ray Distribution on the Growth and Saturation of Bell Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) streaming in weakly magnetized plasmas can drive large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations via nonresonant streaming instability (NRSI), or Bell instability. Using one-dimensional kinetic simulations, we investigate how mono-energetic and power-law CR momentum distributions influence the growth and saturation of NRSI. The linear growth is governed solely by the CR current and is largely insensitive to the CR distribution. However, the saturation depends strongly on the CR distribution and is achieved through CR isotropization, which quenches the driving current. Mono-energetic CRs effectively amplify the magnetic field and isotropize. For power-law distributions, the lowest-energy CRs dominate current relaxation and magnetic growth, while the highest-energy CRs remain weakly scattered, limiting their contribution to saturation. In the absence of low-energy CRs, high-energy particles amplify magnetic fields effectively and isotropize. We provide a modified saturation prescription accounting for these effects and propose a layered CR-confinement scenario upstream of astrophysical shocks, relevant to particle acceleration to high energies.</description>

      <title>Broad-band temporal and spectral study of TeV blazar TXS 0518+211</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a long-term broad-band temporal and spectral study of a TeV BL Lac source TXS 0518+211 by analyzing nearly 16 years (MJD 54682 -- 60670) of simultaneous optical, UV and X-ray light curves from Swift-XRT/UVOT and gamma-ray light curves from Fermi-LAT. Based on the availability of simultaneous multi-wavelength data and considering flux level as the depiction of AGN-jet activity we identified 11 epochs (named as Epoch-A to Epoch-K) and investigated temporal as well as spectral variability during these epochs to understand the emission properties in this source. The fractional variability analysis reveals that, in all epochs, X-ray light curve exhibits relatively high degree of variability in compared to the optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves. The flux-flux plots among different bands, in general, show weak to moderate correlation with Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.29 to 0.58. Notably, during Epoch-I, we detect a possible orphan flare exhibiting increase in the X-ray flux level ($\sim$ 2.4 times of the total average flux) but with no corresponding counterpart seen in the optical, UV bands. In contrast, during Epoch-K, we detect a significant decrease in the X-ray flux but no corresponding decrease in optical, UV and gamma-ray bands. Overall, our study reveals several changes in the flux states and complex nature of jet dominated emission processes. In all the epochs, two-zone leptonic model provides a better description of the broad-band emission in this TeV BL Lac source.</description>

      <title>The Faintest, Extremely Variable X-ray Tidal Disruption Event from a Supermassive Black Hole Binary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs), which occur when stars enter the tidal radii of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and are subsequently torn apart by their tidal forces, represent intriguing phenomena that stimulate growing research interest and pose an increasing number of puzzles in the era of time-domain astronomy. Here we report an unusual X-ray transient, XID 935, discovered in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, the deepest X-ray survey ever. XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016. Not monotonically decreasing during this period, its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor $&gt; 27$ within 2 months, from $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}&lt;10^{40.87}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (10 October 2014 -- 4 January 2015) to $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}=10^{42.31\pm 0.20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (16 March 2015). The X-ray position of XID 935 is located at the center of its host galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of 0.251, whose optical spectra do not display emission characteristics associated with an active galactic nucleus. The peak 0.5--2.0 keV flux is the faintest among all the X-ray-selected TDE candidates to date. Thanks to a total exposure of $\sim 9.5$ Ms in the X-ray bands, we manage to secure relatively well-sampled, 20-year-long X-ray light curves of this deepest X-ray-selected TDE candidate. We find that a partial TDE model could not explain the main declining trend. An SMBH binary TDE model is in acceptable accordance with the light curves of XID 935; however, it fails to match short-timescale fluctuations exactly. Therefore, the exceptional observational features of XID 935 provide a key benchmark for refining quantitative TDE models and simulations.</description>

      <title>Probing the Nature of High-Redshift Long GRB 250114A and Its Magnetar Central Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 250114A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) which triggered the Swift/BAT with a spectroscopic high-redshift at $z = 4.732$. The light curve of the prompt emission is composed of three distinct emission episodes, which are separated by quiescent gaps ranging from tens to hundreds of seconds. While the X-ray light curve exhibits the canonical X-ray emission which is composed of several power-law segments superposition of a giant X-ray flare. More interestingly, there is still significant X-ray emission during the quiescent time in the prompt emission, suggesting a continuously active central engine whose power fluctuates across the $\gamma$-ray detectability threshold. In this paper, we propose a magnetar as the central engine of GRB 250114A by fitting the X-ray light curve, and infer a magnetic field strength $B_{\rm p}=13.24^{+1.73}_{-5.84} \, \times10^{15}\ \mathrm{G}$ and an initial spin period $P_{0}=14.31^{+0.93}_{-3.16} \, \mathrm{ms}$ of magnetar, with a jet correction, fall within a reasonable range. Furthermore, we also compare the prompt emission, X-ray afterglow, $E_{\mathrm p}$-$E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso}}$, and $\varepsilon-$distribution of GBR 250114A with those of other high-$z$ sample-GRBs, and find no significant statistical differences between them.</description>

      <title>Compton-induced $\gamma$-ray Cascade Emissions in Radio Galaxy NGC 1275</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among active galactic nuclei (AGNi), blazars are the brightest emitters of high-energy (HE, $E \geq 100$ MeV) to very-high-energy (VHE, $E \geq 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-rays from their jets. Radio galaxies, being the misaligned parent population of the blazar class, were historically not detected at these frequencies. However, advances in experiments and observatories have led to their detection in the HE--VHE $\gamma$-ray band. In this work, we leverage and refine a Monte-Carlo photon and electron-positron (e$^\pm$) pair tracking code in the AGN environment of the radio galaxy NGC 1275. In the code, we consider the isotropic broad-line region (BLR) and anisotropic Shakura-Sunyaev (SS) accretion disk radiation fields, with mild magnetic fields in the AGN environment. We find that cascade $\gamma$-rays from inverse-Compton scattering by relativistic e$^\pm$ pairs of these external radiation fields can explain the Fermi Large Area Telescope's (LAT) and Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment's observations from the radio galaxy NGC 1275. We present a set of plausible parameters obtained from the code by fitting the source's spectral energy distribution (SED) during flaring events reported during the period December 2022 to January 2023.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of Using Fe XXIII Metastable Transitions as a Density Diagnostic for LMXB Disk Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) occasionally show signs of outflowing material from the accretion disk. Studying these outflows can inform the understanding of the geometry of the systems, as well as the dynamics and energetics of accretion. One key variable for determining the location of these disk winds is the density of the outflowing material. In this paper we explore a density diagnostic based upon the absorption of ionizing photons by density-sensitive metastable states of Fe XXIII. This can yield a blue shifted complex of absorption features in the region of $6.61-6.64$ keV. We use the photoionization code {\sc pion} to test how varying the ionizing spectrum affects the detectability and interpretation of these features. We base these ionizing spectral energy distributions on GX~13$+$1 to represent a bright thermally dominated spectrum; 4U 1735$-$44 representing a harder, fainter LMXB spectrum; and MAXI J1820$+$070 representing a black hole LMXB spectrum completely dominated by Comptonized emission. For each of these, we find that the regime where Fe XXIII can be used as a density diagnostic is with an ionization parameter $\log{(\xi/{\rm erg~cm~s^{-1}})}\sim2-3$ and an outflow density $\log{(n_H/{\rm cm^{-3})}}\gtrsim14$. The typical range of ionization parameters for LMXBs indicates that this technique is more feasibly achieved with BH LMXBs than their NS counterparts.</description>

      <title>Simulations of high-energy neutrino emissions from blazars with the LeHa-Paris code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of astrophysical sources responsible for high-energy cosmic neutrinos has long been a challenge. A significant milestone was achieved with the blazar TXS 0506+056, which was found to be in a flaring state of high gamma-ray emission and associated at the 3$\sigma$ level with a 290 TeV neutrino detected by IceCube in September 2017. This discovery motivated deeper exploration of the theoretical link between photon and neutrino emissions. In this context, simulations of proton-photon interactions in blazars and radiative processes are conducted using advanced numerical codes to predict neutrino spectra. The LeHa-Paris code, previously applied to TXS 0506+056, enables the computation of both leptonic and hadronic components of blazar spectral energy distributions, facilitating exploration of a broad parameter space. In this work, starting from the case of PKS 2155-304, one of the brightest and most studied High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs), known for its extreme variability and subject of multi-wavelength observational campaigns, a methodology has been developed to extend neutrino flux templates, optimized via LeHa-Paris, to the full class of HBLs. Afterwards, neutrino emission models for a subset of HBLs from the 3HSP catalogue are derived.</description>

      <title>Enhanced antineutrino emission from $\beta$ decay in core-collapse supernovae with self-consistent weak decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear weak-interaction rates are known to exert a prominent effect in the late-stages of stellar collapse. Despite their importance, most studies to date on core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have focused primarily on the effects of electron captures, generally neglecting $\beta$ decay contributions. In this Letter, we present the first CCSNe simulation incorporating global $\beta$ decay rates from a microscopic theory. These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $\beta$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We find a significant enhancement of antineutrino emissivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude due to the inclusion of $\beta$ decay rates, as well as 3 orders of magnitude for antineutrino luminosity. It is expected that these new rates could help us constrain the model uncertainties related to weak-interaction processes, improving the prediction of antineutrino signal during the final stages of stellar death and potentially influencing the late-stage evolution of massive stars.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up EFT Approach To Superdense Baryonic Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to arrive at the densest matter in massive compact stars starting from Walecka's linear $\omega$-$\sigma$ mean-field model is described in a series of arguments anchored on hidden local symmetry, hidden scale symmetry and emergent parity-doublet symmetry. I follow the bottom-up approach from chiral symmetry with pions, coupled to hidden local and scale symmetry degrees of freedom. Exploiting the renormalization-group treatment \`a la Shankar and Polchinski of the fermionic interactions on the Fermi sphere, leading to Landau-Migdal Fermi-liquid, one obtains a sort of generalized ``Density Functional" that allows via a topology change hadrons transform to quarks without phase changes at the center of massive stars. The highly dense matter is ``pseudo-conformal" with the sound velocity $v_{pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$ but the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is not equal to zero, hence the matter is non-conformal.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Complex Singlet Model with Phase Transition Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of probing the Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) with gravitational waves from the Electroweak phase transition. The study establishes a connection of the scalar potential parameters, the thermodynamic properties of the phase transition, with the directly measured stochastic gravitational-wave background in the presence of astrophysical background and foreground. Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>The relativistic tidal tensor: general solutions for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes and the Hills mass of naked singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal forces experienced on an orbit contain, in principle, information about the underlying spacetime an object is moving through. Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.</description>

      <title>Evidence For A Correlation Between Astrophysical Neutrinos and Radio Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use data from the first two epochs of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to search for evidence of a correlation between radio variability and the detection of astrophysical neutrinos. We find an excess number of associations between flaring radio sources and neutrinos that were detected between the first and second VLASS observations at $&gt;2\sigma$ confidence. This excess is consistent with radio flares contributing $\sim13\,\%$ of the astrophysical neutrinos observed by IceCube. Notably $&gt;80\,\%$ of the radio flares associated with neutrinos are not detected at either $\gamma$-ray or X-ray wavelengths, highlighting the importance of radio observations for identifying potential electromagnetic counterparts to astrophysical neutrinos. No excess in the number of associations between the wider radio-variable population and the IceCube neutrinos is seen when no time constraint is placed on the neutrino detection. We predict that data from future VLASS epochs will see an excess number of associations between radio flares and neutrinos at the $&gt;3\sigma$ level, and expected improvements to the positional constraints on the neutrinos may increase that confidence to $&gt;5\sigma$, should our results be representative.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect in the stationary cylinder with a radial heat flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conducting cylinder with a uniform magnetic field along its axis and radial temperature gradient is considered at the stationary state. At large temperature gradients the azimuthal Hall electrical current creates the axial magnetic field which strength may be comparable with the original one. It is shown, that the magnetic field, generated by the azimuthal Hall current, leads to the decrease of magnetic field originated by external sources, and this suppression increases with increase of the electromotive force, connected with a thermodiffusion. Obtained results can help to investigate influence of the Hall current on the coupled magneto-thermal evolution of magnetic and electric fields in neutron stars, white dwarfs, and, possibly, in a laboratory facilities.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Galactic Line Source of Axions: The Remarkable Case of 23Na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that $^{23}$Na is a potentially significant source of galactic axions. For temperatures $\gtrsim 7 \times 10^8$K -- characteristic of carbon burning in the massive progenitors of supernovae and ONeMg white dwarfs -- the 440 keV first excited state of $^{23}$Na is thermally populated, with its repeated decays pumping stellar energy into escaping axions. Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\approx 0.1 M_\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \times 10^4$y. Using MESA simulations, a galactic model, and sampling over progenitor masses, locations, and evolutionary stages, we find a continuous flux at earth of $\langle \phi_a \rangle \approx 22$/cm$^2$s for $g^\mathrm{eff}_{aNN} = 10^{-9}$. Some fraction of these axions convert to photons as they propagate through the galactic magnetic field, producing a distinctive 440 keV line $\gamma$ ray detectable by all-sky detectors like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). Assuming a 1$\mu$G galactic magnetic field and a sufficiently light axion mass, we find that COSI will be able to probe $| g_{aNN}^\mathrm{eff} g_{a \gamma \gamma} | \gtrsim1.8 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$ after two years of surveying.</description>

      <title>Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on charged particles and photon production in astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06766v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions. We derive modified expressions for radiated power and photon energy under LIV assumptions and incorporate them into first-order Fermi acceleration models. Our analysis reveals energy thresholds beyond which LIV, within a kinematic framework, significantly alters particle dynamics and photon spectra, introducing non-physical divergences that highlight limitations in perturbative approaches. We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations. Comparisons with observational data, particularly upper limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that future multi-messenger observations, together with the full analysis of particle's trajectories, could constrain LIV parameters through the non-detection of such excesses.</description>

      <title>Gamma rays as leptonic portals to energetic neutrinos: a new Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High center-of-mass electromagnetic~(EM) interactions could produce decaying heavy leptons and hadrons, leading to neutrino generation. These processes might occur in the most extreme astrophysical scenarios, potentially altering the expected gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes in both the hadronic and the leptonic pictures. For instance, neutrinos could arise from high-redshift EM cascades, triggered by gamma rays beyond $10^{18} \; \text{eV}$ scattering background photons, from radio to ultraviolet energy bands. Such energetic gamma rays are predicted in cosmogenic models and in scenarios involving non-standard physics. On astrophysical scales, leptonic production of neutrinos could take place in active galactic nuclei cores, where several-TeV gamma rays interact with the X-ray photons from the hot corona. We explore these scenarios within the CRPropa Monte Carlo code framework, developing dedicated tools to account for leptonic production and decay of heavy leptons and hadrons. In particular, the latter are performed by interfacing with the PYTHIA event generator. With these novel tools, we characterise the spectrum and flavour composition of neutrinos emerging from cosmological EM cascades and from leptonic processes in the core of active galactic nuclei. Finally, we investigate the leptonic production of neutrinos in the context of the IceCube detection of NGC~1068.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Tidal Disruption of Supernova in Galaxy Nuclear Region: A Novel Model for Ambiguous Nuclear Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients, including some extreme nuclear transients with very shallow light-curve declines and weak AGN activity in their host galaxies, have been reported. Stars form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk disappears in low-luminosity AGNs. We propose that the tidal disruption of a supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear transients that are more energetic and evolve more slowly than typical tidal disruption events (TDEs), without the black hole mass limit as in TDEs. In this scenario, the SMBH capture the supernova ejecta, which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington limit for SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$, while it remains sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity \(\gtrsim10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}\) in weak AGNs even with SMBH mass much larger than $10^{8}\,M_\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.</description>

      <title>Constraint on the Physical Origin of Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Emission via Its Nondetected Diffuse Neutrino Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical origin of prompt emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open question since it has been studied more than half a century. Three alternative models (i.e. dissipative photosphere, internal shock, and Internal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence, ICMART) have been proposed to interpret the observations of GRB prompt emission, but none of them can fully interpret all of the observational data collected so far. The question is what is the fraction of these three theoretical models in the prompt emission of GRBs. In this paper, we propose to utilize an innovative method and constrain the fraction of GRB prompt emission models via its nondetected diffuse neutrinos. By adopting two methods (e.g., summing up the individual GRB contributions and assumed luminosity functions of GRB) to calculate diffuse neutrino flux of GRBs for given the benchmark parameters of $\Gamma=300$ and $\varepsilon_{p} \text{/} \varepsilon_{e}=10$, both approaches indicate that most GRBs should be originated from the ICMART model. Moreover, we find that the fractions of the dissipative photosphere model, the internal shock model, and the ICMART model are constrained to be [0, $0.5\%$], [0, $1.1\%$], and [$98.9\%$, 1], respectively, for the method of summing up the individual GRB contributions. For the method of luminosity functions, the fractions of above three models are constrained to be [0, $6.1\%$], [0, $8.2\%$], and [$91.8\%$, 1], respectively. However, such fractions of different models are also dependent on the parameters of $\Gamma$ and $\varepsilon_{p} \text{/} \varepsilon_{e}$.</description>

Abstract: The present study explores the thermal evolution and emission properties of neutron stars within the framework of modified $f(R, T)$ gravity by solving the coupled energy-balance and heat-transport equations. We compute stellar mass and pressure profiles by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in both Einstein gravity and modified gravity, employing the APR, FPS, and SLy equations of state, with and without the strong magnetic field. Using these profiles, we assess the red-shifted surface temperature, $T_s^{\infty}$, as well as the photon and neutrino luminosities for each equation of state. We further examine the effects of the magnetic field, the choice of equation of state, and the underlying gravity theory framework on the cooling of neutron stars, particularly those of magnetized neutron stars or magnetars. Our results indicate that $f(R, T)$ gravity, particularly for the APR and SLy equations of state, exhibits improved agreement with the observed $T_s^{\infty}$ and photon luminosities than standard general relativity, regardless of magnetic-field strength. Moreover, it predicts the neutrino luminosities under both gravity models, all the chosen equations of state, and magnetic field configurations.</description>
