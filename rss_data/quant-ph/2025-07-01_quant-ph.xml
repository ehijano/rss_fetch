      <title>Spectral Bias in Variational Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence. We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs). Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes. Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement schemes tend to slow convergence.</description>

      <title>Metric formalism for precision assessment in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing measurement precision in quantum systems is vital for advancing technologies like quantum sensing and communication. Traditionally, quantum Fisher information (QFI) has been the key tool in determining precision limits within Hermitian quantum systems. However, recent research has expanded to non-Hermitian systems exhibiting real spectra. This study investigates various interpretations of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics such as the normalization and metric approaches. We demonstrate that owing to distinct types of dynamic behaviour, QFI expressions vary significantly depending on the formalism. In particular, the normalization formalism overestimates the enhancement and/or revivals in QFI, effectively post-selecting the most optimistic case of the evolution, which may give an overly favourable impression of the sensitivity and accuracy of quantum measurements. The metric-based interpretation maintains consistency with a Hermitian-like structure, offering a more stable and conservative assessment of measurement precision. This approach provides a more natural representation of the system's evolution, enabling a more accurate assessment of quantum measurement sensitivity without the need for post-selection. We support our claims by focussing on QFI dynamics for a qubit system, while advocating the metric interpretation as a more reliable guide for quantum metrology despite presenting both approaches as valid and complementary ways of understanding non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of measurement-free universal fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to perform quantum error correction (QEC) and robust gate operations on encoded qubits opens the door to demonstrations of quantum algorithms. Contemporary QEC schemes typically require mid-circuit measurements with feed-forward control, which are challenging for qubit control, often slow, and susceptible to relatively high error rates. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a universal toolbox of fault-tolerant logical operations without mid-circuit measurements on a trapped-ion quantum processor. We present modular logical state teleportation between two four-qubit error-detecting codes without measurements during algorithm execution. Moreover, we realize a fault-tolerant universal gate set on an eight-qubit error-detecting code hosting three logical qubits, based on state injection, which can be executed by coherent gate operations only. We apply this toolbox to experimentally realize Grover's quantum search algorithm fault-tolerantly on three logical qubits encoded in eight physical qubits, with the implementation displaying clear identification of the desired solution states. Our work demonstrates the practical feasibility and provides first steps into the largely unexplored direction of measurement-free quantum computation.</description>

      <title>A scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting resonators with high quality factors are extremely sensitive detectors of the complex impedance of materials and devices coupled to them. This capability has been used to measure losses in multiple different materials and, in the case of circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED), has been used to measure the coherent evolution of multiple different types of qubits. Here, we report on the implementation of a scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices. Our scanning setup enables tunable coherent coupling to systems of interest without the need for fabricating on-chip superconducting resonators. We measure the internal quality factor of our resonator sensor in the single-photon regime to be &gt; 10000 and demonstrate capacitive imaging using our sensor with zeptoFarad sensitivity and micron spatial resolution at milliKelvin temperatures. We then use our setup to characterize the energy spectrum and coherence times of multiple transmon qubits with no on-chip readout circuitry. Our work introduces a new tool for using circuit QED to measure existing and proposed qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Lamb-Dicke Dynamics of Interacting Rydberg Atoms Coupled to the Motion of an Optical Tweezer Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays provide a platform for quantum simulation and computation. In this work, we investigate the Lamb-Dicke dynamics of coupled Rydberg atoms for different trapping frequencies. We model the atomic motion by both internal and motional degrees of freedom, in which the motional states arise due to the oscillation of each atom in optical tweezer traps due to the light-atom interaction. In this setup, the internal states are coupled to a laser light with a Rabi frequency, while each internal state of each atom is also harmonically trapped with a trap frequency that depends on the internal state. The impact of the coherent motion of the optical tweezers on the collective dynamics of the many-body Rydberg atoms is explored for varying Lamb-Dicke parameters and with different trap frequencies. We see the occurrence of dynamical phases e.g., Rabi oscillations in the decoupled limit, the limit torus phase for magic trapping, and the limit cycle phase as the trap frequency is further increased.</description>

      <title>Entropic characterization of Tunneling and State Pairing in a Quasi-Exactly Solvable Sextic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the (de)localization properties of a quasi-exactly solvable (QES) sextic potential $V_{\text{QES}}(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x^6 + 2x^4 - 2(2\lambda + 1)x^2)$ as a function of the tunable parameter $\lambda \in [-\frac{3}{4}, 6]$. For $\lambda &gt; -\frac{1}{2}$, the potential exhibits a symmetric double-well structure, with tunneling emerging for the ground state level at $\lambda \approx 0.732953$. {For the lowest energy states \( n = 0,1,2,3 \), we construct physically meaningful variational wavefunctions that $i)$ respect parity symmetry under the transformation $ x \rightarrow -x $, $ii)$ exhibit the correct asymptotic behavior at large distances, and $iii)$ allow for exact analytical Fourier transforms. Variational energies match Lagrange Mesh and available exact analytical QES results with relative errors $\simeq 10^{-8}$ for $n = 0, 1, 2$ and $\simeq 10^{-6}$ for the third excited state $n=3$. We demonstrate that entropic measures (Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler, and Cumulative Residual Jeffreys divergences) surpass conventional variance-based methods in revealing tunneling transitions, wavefunction symmetry breaking, and quantum state pairing. Our results confirm that the Beckner-Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski entropic uncertainty relation holds across all examined values of $n$ and $\lambda$. The quality of the trial function is also validated by the small $\sim10^{-10}$ Cumulative Residual Jeffreys divergences from the exact QES solutions.</description>

      <title>Heavy-tailed open quantum systems reveal long-lived and ultrasensitive coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding random open quantum systems is critical for characterizing the performance of large-scale quantum devices and exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena. Various features in these systems, including spectral distributions, gap scaling, and decoherence, have been examined by modelling randomness under the central limit theorem. Here, we investigate random open quantum systems beyond the central limit theorem, focusing on heavy-tailed system-environment interactions. By extending the Ginibre unitary ensemble, we model system-environment interactions to exhibit a continuous transition from light-tailed to heavy-tailed distributions. This generalized configuration reveals unique properties-gapless spectra, Pareto principle governing dissipation, orthogonalization, and quasi-degeneracies-all linked to the violation of the central limit theorem. The synergy of these features challenges the common belief-the tradeoff between stability and sensitivity-through the emergence of long-lived and ultrasensitive quantum coherences that exhibit an enhancement of two orders of magnitude compared to predictions under the central limit theorem. The result, which is based on heavy-tailedness of open quantum systems, provides highly desirable platforms for quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Extended Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger Equation with Complex Frequency Modes for General Basis Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extended formulation of the non-Markovian stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with complex frequency modes (extended cNMSSE), enabling the treatment of open quantum system dynamics under general spectral densities. This extension employs complete non-exponential basis expansions for the bath correlation functions, thereby generalizing the applicability of the cNMSSE framework beyond environments with Debye-type spectral structures. By preserving the wavefunction-based description and favorable linear-scaling properties, the extended cNMSSE offers an efficient and flexible approach to simulate non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The method is implemented within a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved numerically via matrix product state (MPS) techniques. Benchmark simulations on four representative cases, including discrete spectra, Ohmic spectra with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral densities, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward-backward stochastic Schr\"odinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM). The extended cNMSSE thus provides a robust and scalable framework for accurate simulations of non-Markovian open quantum systems with general environments.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws of Quantum Information Lifetime in Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information is typically fragile under measurement and environmental coupling. Remarkably, we find that its lifetime can scale exponentially with system size when the environment is continuously monitored via mid-circuit measurements -- regardless of bath size. Starting from a maximally entangled state with a reference, we analytically prove this exponential scaling for typical Haar random unitaries and confirm it through numerical simulations in both Haar-random and chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of bath monitoring, the lifetime exhibits a markedly different scaling: it grows at most linearly -- or remains constant -- with system size and decays inversely with bath size. We further extend our findings numerically to a broad class of initial states. We discuss implications for monitored quantum circuits in the weak measurement limit, quantum algorithms such as quantum diffusion models and quantum reservoir computing, and quantum communication. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of resolving the predicted scaling regimes experimentally via noisy simulations of IBM Quantum hardwares.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a quantum sequence alignment algorithm for quantum bioinformatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22775v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of a quantum sequence alignment (QSA) algorithm on biological data in environments simulating noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. The approach to quantum bioinformatics adapts the original QSA algorithm proposed in 2000 to current capabilities and limitations of NISQ-era quantum computers and uses a genetic algorithm for state preparation (GASP) to create encoding circuits to load both database and target sequences into the quantum data registers. The implementation is tested in a simulated quantum computer environment to validate the approach and refine the GASP data-loading circuit designs. The results demonstrate the practicalities of deploying the QSA algorithm and exemplify the potential of GASP for data encoding in the realm of quantum circuit design, particularly for complex algorithms in quantum bioinformatics and other data-rich problems.</description>

      <title>Optimization by VarQITE on Adaptive Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) is a powerful method to derive the ground states of the systems. Only the damping of quantum states leads it; hence, reaching the ground state is guaranteed by nature without any external manipulation. Numerous QITE methods by many groups are used to improve speed and accuracy, derive excited states, and solve combined optimization problems. However, the QITE methods have not been used for quantum machine learning to predict the ideal values for multiple input values. Therefore, we propose a method for applying QITE methods for quantum machine learning and demonstrate fitting problems of elementary functions and classification problems on a 2-D plane. As a result, we confirmed that our method was more accurate than a quantum neural network in solving some problems. Our method can be used for other quantum machine learning algorithms; hence, it may be the milestone for applying QITE to quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Terahertz source-on-a-chip with decade-long stability using layered superconductor elliptical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of the DEJAMPS purification protocol in noisy entangled photon systems, a Monte Carlo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement purification is a critical enabling technology for quantum communication, allowing high-fidelity entangled pairs to be distilled from noisy resources. We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo study of the DEJMPS purification protocol applied to polarization-entangled photon pairs subject to both amplitude-damping noise (gamma) and dephasing noise (p). By sweeping (gamma, p) over a two-dimensional grid and performing repeated stochastic trials, we map out the average fidelity and average yield surfaces of the purified output, as well as the net gains (DF) and losses (DY) relative to the unpurified baseline. Our results show that a single round of DEJMPS purification can boost entanglement fidelity by up to 0.07 in high-noise regimes, while incurring a yield penalty of up to 0.55. Fidelity gains grow monotonically with both gamma and p, whereas yields decline more sharply under combined noise. Contour and 3D surface plots of DF(gamma, p) and (DY, gamma, p) vividly illustrate the trade-off between quality and quantity of distilled pairs. This two-parameter Monte Carlo characterization provides practical guidance for optimizing purification depth and operating points in real-world photonic networks, and represents, to our knowledge, the first detailed numerical charting of both fidelity and yield improvements across a continuous noise landscape for DEJMPS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction of a full-space quantum Hamiltonian from its effective Feshbach's model-space avatar is shown feasible. In a preparatory step the information carried by the effective Hamiltonian is compactified using a linear algebraic operation (matrix inversion). A ``universal'' coupled set of polynomial algebraic equations it then obtained. In a few simplest special cases their solution is given and discussed.</description>

      <title>On the polemic assessment of what Bell did</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their Nobel Prize-winning empirical falsification, the interpretation of the Bell inequality remains a subject of controversy. This article discusses and attempts to clarify the reasons John S. Bell and A. Einstein claimed that quantum entanglement implies puzzling nonlocal correlations that Einstein famously termed ``spooky action at a distance.'' The issue remains highly controversial and has roughly divided the scientific community into localists and nonlocalists. Without taking a stance for either side in the long-standing, polarized debate, we examine Bell's actual argument, highlighting the differences between his approach and the current orthodoxy.</description>

      <title>QTurbo: A Robust and Efficient Compiler for Analog Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulation leverages native hardware dynamics to emulate complex quantum systems with great efficiency by bypassing the quantum circuit abstraction. However, conventional compilation methods for analog simulators are typically labor-intensive, prone to errors, and computationally demanding. This paper introduces QTurbo, a powerful analog quantum simulation compiler designed to significantly enhance compilation efficiency and optimize hardware execution time. By generating precise and noiseresilient pulse schedules, our approach ensures greater accuracy and reliability, outperforming the existing state-of-theart approach.</description>

      <title>MPC in the Quantum Head (or: Superposition-Secure (Quantum) Zero-Knowledge)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MPC-in-the-head technique (Ishai et al., STOC 2007) is a celebrated method to build zero-knowledge protocols with desirable theoretical properties and high practical efficiency. This technique has generated a large body of research and has influenced the design of real-world post-quantum cryptographic signatures. In this work, we present a generalization of the MPC-in-the-head paradigm to the quantum setting, where the MPC is running a quantum computation. As an application of our framework, we propose a new approach to build zero-knowledge protocols where security holds even against a verifier that can obtain a superposition of transcripts. This notion was pioneered by Damgard et al., who built a zero-knowledge protocol for NP (in the common reference string model) secure against superposition attacks, by relying on perfectly hiding and unconditionally binding dual-mode commitments. Unfortunately, no such commitments are known from standard cryptographic assumptions. In this work we revisit this problem, and present two new three-round protocols in the common reference string model: (i) A zero-knowledge argument for NP, whose security reduces to the standard learning with errors (LWE) problem. (ii) A zero-knowledge argument for QMA from the same assumption.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Continuous Variable Terahertz Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocol that employs orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the terahertz (THz) band to enable high-throughput and secure quantum communication. By encoding quantum information across multiple subcarriers, the protocol enhances spectral efficiency and mitigates channel dispersion and atmospheric attenuation. We present a comprehensive security analysis under collective Gaussian attacks, considering both terrestrial free-space channels, accounting for humidity-induced absorption, and inter-satellite links, incorporating realistic intermodulation noise. Simulations show secret key rates (SKR) reaching ~72 bits per channel use in open-air conditions. While intermodulation noise imposes trade-offs, optimised modulation variance enables resilience and secure communication range. The maximum terrestrial quantum link extends up to 4.5 m due to atmospheric THz absorption, whereas inter-satellite links can support secure communication over distances exceeding 100 km, owing to minimal propagation channel losses in space. We evaluate the practical implementation of our protocol using recently developed on-chip coherent THz sources based on superconducting Josephson junctions. These compact, voltage-tunable emitters produce wideband coherent radiation, making them ideal candidates for integration in scalable quantum networks. By incorporating their characteristics into our simulations, we assess secure key generation under various environmental conditions. Our results show secure communication over distances up to 3 m in open air, and up to 26 km in cryogenic or vacuum environments. This work advances the prospect of compact, high-capacity CVQKD systems for both terrestrial and space-based THz quantum communication.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to multi-image quantum encryption/decryption using qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce groundbreaking techniques in image encryption, assuming the existence of quantum computing ressources functioning with qudits, where d is a power of 2. Our quantum representation of color multi-image is based on space-filling curves and allows to reduce the storage space. We generalize the quantum baker map, so that it may scramble two n-qudits. By doing so, we enlarge its parameter space exponentially, leading to a better security. We define two new concepts of mixed scrambling and mixed diffusion, and present a variety of schemes, depending on the needs of the users.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER) was recently proposed as a fast and robust single-qubit gate mechanism in $^{87}$Sr. Here, we demonstrate that ONER enables purely optical single-qudit control, addressing multiple hyperfine ground-state transitions within the ten-dimensional nuclear spin manifold. We show that ONER achieves high-fidelity spin manipulations, exceeding fidelities of 99.9%, while maintaining coherence even under realistic noise sources. These results establish ONER as a scalable and experimentally viable platform for high-dimensional quantum computing and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Feature Prediction in Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Networks with Applications in Information Hiding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental representation of complex, nonlinear structured data across various domains, including social networks and quantum systems. Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (QGRNNs) have been proposed to model quantum dynamics in graph-based quantum systems, but their applicability to classical data remains an open problem. In this paper, we leverage QGRNNs to process classical graph-structured data. In particular, we demonstrate how QGRNN can reconstruct node features in classical datasets. Our results show that QGRNN achieves high feature reconstruction accuracy, leading to near-perfect classification. Furthermore, we propose an information hiding technique based on our QGRNN, where messages are embedded into a graph, then retrieved under certain conditions. We assess retrieval accuracy for different dictionary sizes and message lengths, showing that QGRNN maintains high retrieval accuracy, with minor degradation as complexity increases. These findings demonstrate the scalability and robustness of QGRNNs for both classical data processing and secure information hiding, paving the way for quantum-enhanced feature extraction, privacy-preserving computations, and quantum steganography.</description>

      <title>Rotational-invariant quantum key distribution based on a quantum dot source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a cutting-edge field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to enable secure communication between parties involved. Single-photon quantum emitters offer remarkable on-demand photon emission, near-unitary indistinguishability, and low multiphoton generation, thereby enhancing the performance of QKD protocols. Standard approaches in which the polarization degree-of-freedom is exploited are limited by the precise alignment between the communicating parties. To overcome this obstacle, the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) of light represents a suitable candidate for encoding the information, as it allows the implementation of rotational-invariant photonic states that remove the need for a fixed physical reference frame between the communicating parties. Here, we report the implementation of an on-demand, rotational-invariant BB84-QKD protocol achieved by exploiting a bright quantum dot source, active time-to-spatial demultiplexing, and Q-plate devices with a space-variant pattern to encode hybrid photonic states. Our findings suggest a viable direction for the use of rotational-invariant hybrid states in on-demand QKD protocols, potentially enhancing security and robustness in complex operational scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the outstanding challenges in contemporary science and technology is building a quantum computer that is useful in applications. By starting from an estimate of the algorithm success rate, we can explicitly connect gate fidelity to quantum system size targets and define a quantitative roadmap that maximizes performance while avoiding distractions. We identify four distinct phases for quantum hardware and enabling technology development. The aim is to improve performance as we scale and increase the algorithmic complexity the quantum hardware is capable of running, the algorithmic radius, towards a point that sets us up for quantum advantage with deep noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing (NISQ) as well as building a large-scale error-corrected quantum computer (QEC). Our hope is that this document contributes to shaping the discussion about the future of the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the issue of estimating dynamical parameters in quantum electrodynamics. We numerically compute the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) of physical parameters in electron-muon and Compton scattering at tree level. In particular, we consider the estimation of centre-of-mass three-momentum magnitude and polar scattering angle through measurements on the internal degrees of freedom (helicity or polarisation) of the scattered particles. Computations are carried out for pure and maximally mixed initial states. The QFIM values are then used to compute the quantum Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds on the estimations at hand. Further, we compare such ultimate bounds to the classical Fisher information of local polarisation or helicity degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Maxwell's Equations: Circuit Design, "Black Hole" Barren Plateaus Mitigation, and GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving partial differential equations by embedding the governing physics into the loss function associated with deep neural network. In this work, a Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Network (QPINN) framework is proposed to solve two-dimensional (2D) time-dependent Maxwell's equations. Our approach utilizes a parameterized quantum circuit in conjunction with the classical neural network architecture and enforces physical laws, including a global energy conservation principle, during training. A quantum simulation library was developed to efficiently compute circuit outputs and derivatives by leveraging GPU acceleration based on PyTorch, enabling end-to-end training of the QPINN. The method was evaluated on two 2D electromagnetic wave propagation problems: one in free space (vacuum) and one with a dielectric medium. Multiple quantum circuit ans\"atze, input scales, and an added loss term were compared in a thorough ablation study. Furthermore, recent techniques to enhance PINN convergence, including random Fourier feature embeddings and adaptive time-weighting, were incorporated. Our results demonstrate that the QPINN achieves accuracy comparable, and even greater than the classical PINN baseline, while using a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters. This study also shows that adding an energy conservation term to the loss stabilizes training and improves the physical fidelity of the solution in the lossless free-space case. This added term helps mitigate a new kind of a barren plateau (BP) related phenomenon - ``black hole'' (BH) loss landscape for the quantum experiments in that scenario. By optimizing the quantum-circuit ansatz and embedding energy-conservation constraints, our QPINN achieves up to a 19 percent higher accuracy on 2D Maxwell benchmark problems compared to a classical PINN.</description>

      <title>Bending Hyperplanes, Nonlinear Entanglement Witnesses via Envelopes of Linear Witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are fundamental tools for detecting entanglement. However traditional linear witnesses often fail to identify most of the entangled states. In this work, we construct a family of nonlinear entanglement witnesses by taking the envelope of linear witnesses defined over continuous families of pure bipartite states with fixed Schmidt bases. This procedure effectively "bends" the hyperplanes associated with linear witnesses into curved hypersurfaces, thereby extending the region of detectable entangled states. The resulting conditions can be expressed in terms of the positive semi-definiteness of a family of matrices, whose principal minors define a hierarchy of increasingly sensitive detection criteria. We show that this construction is not limited to the transposition map and generalizes naturally to arbitrary Positive but not Completely Positive (PnCP) maps, leading to nonlinear analogues of general entanglement witnesses. We emphasize that the required measurements remain experimentally accessible, as the nonlinear criteria are still formulated in terms of expectation values over local operator bases. Through both analytical and numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear witnesses outperform their linear counterparts in detecting entangled states which may evade individual linear EWs in the construction. This approach offers a practical and conceptually elegant enhancement to entanglement detection in finite-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting and quantifying non-Markovianity via quantum direct cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the efficacy of the two recently introduced witnesses of non-Markovianity, namely that based on temporal correlations in pseudo-density matrix and temporal steering correlations in detecting information backflow. We show, through specific counterexamples taken from existing literature, that they can witness a process to be non-Markovian where trace distance and entropic distinguishability measures may fail. We further show that, since the pseudo-density matrix is directly related to the Choi matrix of a channel via the partial transpose, it can be generalized to quantify the total quantum memory in any indivisible process. Moreover, we make an interesting observation that temporal steerable correlations-based measure may not capture eternal non-Markovianity hence may not be proportional to Choi-matrix-based methods, while pseudo-density matrix-based measures introduced in this work faithfully capture eternal non-Markovianity. Our work highlights important distinction between weak and strong forms of quantum direct cause in quantum mechanics when applied to open system dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator scrambling, which governs the spread of quantum information in many-body systems, is a central concept in both condensed matter and high-energy physics. Accurately capturing the emergent properties of these systems remains a formidable challenge for classical computation, while quantum simulators have emerged as a powerful tool to address this complexity. In this work, we reveal a fundamental connection between operator scrambling and the reliability of quantum simulations. We show that the Trotter error in simulating operator dynamics is bounded by the degree of operator scrambling, providing the most refined analysis of Trotter errors in operator dynamics so far. Furthermore, we investigate the entanglement properties of the evolved states, revealing that sufficient entanglement can lead to error scaling governed by the normalized Frobenius norms of both the observables of interest and the error operator, thereby enhancing simulation robustness and efficiency compared to previous works. We also show that even in regimes where the system's entanglement remains low, operator-induced entanglement can still emerge and suppress simulation errors. Our results unveil a comprehensive relationship between Trotterization, operator scrambling, and entanglement, offering new perspectives for optimizing quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions and information-theoretic measures of a spin-oscillator system with non-Hermitian coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe some interesting properties of a spin-oscillator system with non-Hermitian coupling. As shown earlier, the Hilbert space of this problem can be described by infinitely-many closed two-dimensional invariant subspaces together with the global ground state. We expose the appearance of exceptional points (EP) on such two-dimensional subspaces together with quantum phase transitions marking the transit from real to complex eigenvalues. We analytically compute some information-theoretic measures for this intriguing system, namely, the thermal entropy as well as the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies using the framework of the so-called \(G\)-inner product. Such entropic measures are verified to be non-analytic at the points which mark the quantum phase transitions on the space of parameters -- a naive comparison with Ehrenfest's classification of phase transitions then suggests that these transitions are of the first order as the first derivatives of the entropies are discontinuous across such transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After publishing my book "Quantum Computing Architecture and Hardware for Engineers: Step by Step" [1] (now I call it Volume I), in which spin qubit and superconducting qubit quantum computers were covered, I decided to continue to write the second volume to cover the trapped ion qubit quantum computer, which was also taught in my EE274 class. I follow the same structure as in Volume I by discussing the physics, mathematics, and their connection to laser pulses and electronics based on how they fulfill the five DiVincenzo's criteria. I also think it would be a good idea to share the second volume on arXiv so that more people can read it for free, and I can continue to update the contents. As of July 2025, I have finished the trapped ion quantum computer part. In the future, I plan to write more critical topics in a step-by-step manner to bridge engineers who did not receive rigorous training in Physics to the quantum computing world.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the phase space formulation of the Jaynes-Cummings model through the explicit construction of the full Wigner function for a hybrid bipartite quantum system composed of a two-level atom and a quantized coherent field. By employing the Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence and the coadjoint orbit method, we derive an informationally complete quasi-probability distribution that captures the full dynamics of light-matter interaction. This approach provides a detailed phase space perspective of fundamental quantum phenomena such as Rabi oscillations, atomic population inversion, and entanglement generation. We further measure the purity of the reduced quantized field state by means of an appropriate Wigner function corresponding to the bosonic field part in order to investigate the entanglement dynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Decoherence, entanglement, and information in the electron double-slit experiment with monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a theoretical model of the double-slit experiment with electrons whose paths are monitored. This monitoring, inspired by a recent text by Maudlin, is performed by the Coulomb scattering of the electron by a proton. A simple quantum mechanical calculation is presented, inspired in part by a recent experimental demonstration of this famous thought experiment. The results illustrate the relationship between entanglement and the loss of coherence in the interference pattern. The tradeoff between the visibility of interference and the information gained by measurement is also explored. This calculation can provide advanced undergraduates insight into decoherence, entanglement, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Phase amplitude separation of wave function as local gauge transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum-mechanical wave function is complex, but all observations are real, expressible through expectation values and transition matrix elements that involve the wave functions. It can be useful to separate at the outset the amplitude and phase as real quantities that together carry the same information that is contained in the complex wave function. Two main avenues for doing so go way back in the history of the subject and have been used both for scattering and bound states. A connection is made here to gauge transformations of electrodynamics where the advent of quantum mechanics and later quantum field theory showed the central role that local gauge transformations play in physics.</description>

      <title>Ultra-sensitive magnetic sensor based on 3-dimensional rotation induced Berry phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-sensitivity magnetometers play a crucial role in various domains, including fundamental physics, biomedical imaging, and navigation. Levitated diamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers exhibit significant potential for magnetic sensing due to their high mechanical quality (Q) factor and long spin coherence time. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on electron spin-based measurements of alternating current (AC) magnetic fields. In this letter, we propose a novel approach for direct current (DC) magnetic field measurement based on the Berry phase generated by three-dimensional rotation. We analyze the adiabatic evolution of the 14N nuclear spin inside a levitated 3D rotating diamond with frequencies around MHz. Our finding reveals that the Berry phase exhibits high sensitivity to external parameters near rotation induced nuclear spin resonance. Using this mechanism, we theoretically demonstrate that the static magnetic field sensitivity can reach 10^(-7) T/Hz^(1/2)/N^(1/2) for 14N nuclear spins under the current experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing in capacitively coupled Kerr parametric oscillators using frequency-chirped drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parametric oscillations of two capacitively coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) with frequency-chirped two- and one-photon drives. The two-KPO system adiabatically evolves from the initial vacuum state to an oscillation state corresponding to a solution state in quantum-annealing applications. Frequency chirping dynamically changes the detuning between resonance and oscillation frequencies during parametric modulation and reduces unwanted population transfer to excited states caused by pure dephasing and photon loss. We observe that frequency chirping increases the success probability to obtain the solution state and that simulations taking into account pure dephasing reproduce experiments with and without frequency chirping. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of frequency chirping to a KPO-based quantum annealer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground states of Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Realization of a functioning dual-type trapped-ion quantum network node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped ions constitute a promising platform for implementation of a quantum network. Recently, a dual-type qubit scheme has been realized in a quantum network node where the communication qubits and the memory qubits are encoded in different energy levels of the same ion species, such that the generation of ion-photon entanglement on the communication qubits has negligible crosstalk error on the preloaded quantum information in the memory qubits. However, to achieve the versatile applications of a quantum network, a crucial component of the dual-type node, namely the entangling gate between the communication and the memory qubits, is still missing. Here we report a dual-type quantum network node equipped with ion-photon entanglement generation, crosstalk-free quantum memory and entangling gates between the dual-type qubits simultaneously. We demonstrate its practical applications including the quantum state teleportation and the preparation of multipartite entangled state. Our work achieves the necessary components of a dual-type quantum network node and paves the way toward its applications in a large-scale quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Alleviating CoD in Renewable Energy Profile Clustering Using an Optical Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional clustering problem of renewable energy profiles is typically formulated as a combinatorial optimization that suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD) on classical computers. To address this issue, this paper first proposed a kernel-based quantum clustering method. More specifically, the kernel-based similarity between profiles with minimal intra-group distance is encoded into the ground-state of the Hamiltonian in the form of an Ising model. Then, this NP-hard problem can be reformulated into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), which a Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) can naturally solve with significant improvement over classical computers. The test results from a real optical quantum computer verify the validity of the proposed method. It also demonstrates its ability to address CoD in an NP-hard clustering problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how observables with optimal sensitivity to environmental properties can be constructed explicitly from the master equation of an open-quantum system. Our approach does not rely on the explicit solution of the master equation. This makes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD), the operator of optimal sensitivity and key quantity in quantum metrology, available to a large class of systems of interest, both in and out-of-equilibrium. We validate our approach by reproducing the SLD for temperature in quantum Brownian motion and demonstrate its versatility by constructing the optimal observable for the non-equilibrium relaxation rate.</description>

      <title>Topologically noise robust network steering without inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks with independent sources allow observing quantum nonlocality or steering with just a single measurement per node of the network, or without any inputs. Inspired by the recently introduced notion of swap-steering, we consider here the triangle network scenario without inputs, where one of the parties is trusted to perform a well-calibrated measurement. In this scenario, we first propose a linear witness to detect triangle network swap-steering. Then, by using the correlations that achieve the maximum value of this inequality, and assuming that all the sources are the same, we can self-test the state generated by the sources and the measurements of the untrusted party. We then extend this framework to ring networks with an arbitrary number of nodes with one of them being trusted. Interestingly, this is the first example of a topologically robust, that is, one can observe steerability without assuming the network structure of the network, as well as noise-robust quantum advantage in a network. Additionally, by allowing the trusted party to perform tomography of their subsystems, we demonstrate that every bipartite entangled state will result in swap-steerable correlations in the ring network. For this purpose, we construct linear witnesses to detect ring network swap-steering corresponding to every bipartite entangled state.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Algorithm for Estimating Fidelity to a Pure State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optimal quantum algorithm for fidelity estimation between two quantum states when one of them is pure. In particular, the (square root) fidelity of a mixed state to a pure state can be estimated to within additive error $\varepsilon$ by using $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ queries to their state-preparation circuits, achieving a quadratic speedup over the folklore $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$. Our approach is technically simple, and can moreover estimate the quantity $\sqrt{\operatorname{tr}(\rho\sigma^2)}$ that is not common in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first query-optimal approach to fidelity estimation involving mixed states.</description>

      <title>An Exact Five-Step Method for Classicalizing N-level Quantum Systems: Application to Quantum Entanglement Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a general and exact method for classicalizing the dynamics of any $N$-level quantum system, transforming quantum evolution into a classical-like framework using the geometry of complex projective spaces $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$. The method can be expressed as five-step algorithmic procedure to derive a classical Hamiltonian and a symplectic structure for the Poisson brackets, yielding $N-1$ Hamilton's equations that precisely replicate the quantum dynamics, including complex phenomena like entanglement. We demonstrate the method's efficacy by classicalizing two interacting qubits in $\mathbb{CP}^3$, exactly reproducing quantum observables such as quantum probabilities, quaternionic population differences and the concurrence, capturing entanglement dynamics via a classical analog.</description>

      <title>Realignment Criterion: A necessary and sufficient condition for two-qubit $X$-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Computable Cross Norm (CCN), or realignment criterion, is a widely used method for entanglement detection in quantum systems; however, it typically provides only a necessary condition. In this work, we advance the applicability of the realignment criterion by deriving a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for detecting entanglement in two-qubit. $X$-states derive their name from the characteristic 'X' shape of their density matrix, which contains seven independent matrix parameters. Notably, they incorporate several important subclasses of entangled states, including Bell states, Werner states, and maximally entangled mixed states. $X$-states have proven highly useful in entanglement studies due to their sparse structure and the ease with which entanglement-related quantities can be computed. This refined criterion improves the identification of entangled states that the standard CCN approach fails to detect, thereby extending the utility of the method.</description>

Abstract: As hybrid quantum-classical models gain traction in machine learning, there is a growing need for tools that assess their effectiveness beyond raw accuracy. We present QMetric, a Python package offering a suite of interpretable metrics to evaluate quantum circuit expressibility, feature representations, and training dynamics. QMetric quantifies key aspects such as circuit fidelity, entanglement entropy, barren plateau risk, and training stability. The package integrates with Qiskit and PyTorch, and is demonstrated via a case study on binary MNIST classification comparing classical and quantum-enhanced models.

      <title>High-Performance Contraction of Quantum Circuits for Riemannian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on optimizing the gates of a quantum circuit with a given topology to approximate the unitary time evolution governed by a Hamiltonian. Recognizing that unitary matrices form a mathematical manifold, we employ Riemannian optimization methods -- specifically the Riemannian trust-region algorithm -- which involves second derivative calculations with respect to the gates. Our key technical contribution is a matrix-free algorithmic framework that avoids the explicit construction and storage of large unitary matrices acting on the whole Hilbert space. Instead, we evaluate all quantities as sums over state vectors, assuming that these vectors can be stored in memory. We develop HPC-optimized kernels for applying gates to state vectors and for the gradient and Hessian computation. Further improvements are achieved by exploiting sparsity structures due to Hamiltonian conservation laws, such as parity conservation, and lattice translation invariance. We benchmark our implementation on the Fermi-Hubbard model with up to 16 sites, demonstrating a nearly linear parallelization speed-up with up to 112 CPU threads. Finally, we compare our implementation with an alternative matrix product operator-based approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators ($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively in the symmetry-broken phase.</description>

      <title>Reducing Complexity of Shadow Process Tomography with Generalized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, including quantum computers, quantum networks and quantum sensors. Shadow process tomography (SPT) utilizes the Choi isomorphism to map QPT to shadow state tomography (SST), significantly reducing the sample complexity for extracting information from quantum processes. However, SPT relies on random unitary operators and complicates the determination of the optimal unitary operator that minimizes the shadow norm, which is the key factor influencing the sample complexity. In this work, we propose a generalized SPT framework that minimizes the shadow norm by replacing unitary operators with generalized measurements (POVMs). This approach, termed shadow process tomography with POVMs (POVM-SPT), uses convex optimization to identify the optimal POVM for minimizing the shadow norm, thereby further reducing sample complexity. We demonstrate the identification of the optimal POVM through numerical simulations and provide the corresponding optimization algorithms. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that POVM-SPT achieves a substantial reduction in shadow norm compared to conventional SPT, with an approximate 7-fold improvement for single-qubit input states and a remarkable $2^{180}$-fold enhancement for 64-qubit input states. These results reveal that POVM-SPT offers significant advantages in simplifying SPT tasks, particularly for large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Non-classicality of two-qubit quantum collision model: non-Markovian effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit quantum system in contact with an environment modeled by a microscopic collision model with added ancilla-ancilla collisions in the non-Markovian regime. Two schemes of the two-qubit collision model with carried-forward correlations are introduced. In one scheme, a single stream of ancillae interacts with only one of the qubits of the two-qubit system; in the other, both the qubits interact with two independent sequences of ancillae, which could be at the same or different temperatures. The system's non-Markovian evolution is examined using the trace distance measure, and the non-classicality of the system is studied using the Wigner function, non-classical volume, and concurrence. Also, interesting steady-state behavior is observed when both the independent ancillae are kept at the same temperature.</description>

      <title>Configurable photonic simulator for quantum field dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field simulators provide unique opportunities for investigating the dynamics of quantum fields through tabletop experiments. A primary drawback of standard encoding schemes is their rigidity: altering the theory, its coupling geometry, metric structure, or simulation time typically requires redesigning the experimental setup, which imposes strong constraints on the types of dynamics and theories that can be simulated. Here, we introduce the Optical Time Algorithm (OTA) as a unifying framework, enabling the efficient simulation of large classes of free quantum field dynamics using a single optical circuit design that separates the time from the Hamiltonian's structure. By modifying the parameters of the optical elements, our method allows us to engineer timescales, coupling graphs, spacetime metrics, and boundary conditions, thereby facilitating the implementation of relativistic and non-relativistic, real- and complex-valued, short- and long-range quantum field theories on both flat and curved spacetimes. We exploit the OTA's configurability to investigate the spreading of quantum correlations in space and time for theories with continuously varying coupling ranges. Relevant features predicted by quantum field theory can be observed on systems of $10-20$ modes, which paves the ground for experimental implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, the vector components of a time-varying (AC) magnetic field are measured in a phase sensitive manner. This allows for the determination of the magnetic field's polarization. This polarization contains useful information about the nearby magnetic environment, such as the response of lossy or anisotropic materials, or the reactance of electrical currents.</description>

      <title>Will it glue? On short-depth designs beyond the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a range of results on several groups of broad interest in quantum information science: the Clifford group, the orthogonal group, the unitary symplectic groups, and the matchgate group. For all of these groups, we prove that analogues of unitary designs cannot be generated by any circuit ensemble with light-cones that are smaller than the system size. This implies linear lower bounds on the circuit depth in one-dimensional systems. For the Clifford and orthogonal group, we moreover show that a broad class of circuits cannot generate designs in sub-linear depth on any circuit architecture. We show this by exploiting observables in the higher-order commutants of each group, which allow one to distinguish any short-depth circuit from truly random. While these no-go results rule out short-depth unitary designs, we prove that slightly weaker forms of randomness -- including additive-error state designs and anti-concentration in sampling distributions -- nevertheless emerge at logarithmic depths in many cases. Our results reveal that the onset of randomness in shallow quantum circuits is a widespread yet subtle phenomenon, dependent on the interplay between the group itself and the context of its application.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Open Quantum Dynamics with Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method to simulate open quantum many-body dynamics by combining time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) with quantum trajectory techniques. Our approach unravels the Lindblad master equation into an ensemble of stochastic Schr\"odinger equations for a variational ansatz, avoiding the exponential cost of density matrix evolution. The method is compatible with generic ansatz\"e, including expressive neural-network wavefunctions. We derive the nonlinear stochastic equations of motion for the variational parameters and employ suitable Stratonovich numerical solvers. To validate our approach, we simulate quenches in the locally dissipative long-range Ising model in a transverse field, accurately capturing non-equilibrium magnetization and spin squeezing dynamics relevant to trapped-ion and Rydberg atom experiments. The framework is computationally efficient, scalable on high-performance computing platforms, and can be readily integrated into existing tVMC implementations. This work enables large-scale simulations of complex, dissipative quantum systems in higher dimensions, with broad implications for quantum technology and fundamental science.</description>

      <title>Finite Gaussian assistance protocols and a conic metric for extremizing spacelike vacuum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a pure Gaussian tripartition, a range of entanglement between two parties ($AB$) can be purified through classical communication of Gaussian measurements performed within the third ($C$). To begin, this work introduces a direct method to calculate a hierarchic series of projective $C$ measurements for the removal of any $AB$ Gaussian noise, circumventing divergences in prior protocols. Next, a multimode conic framework is developed for pursuing the maximum (Gaussian entanglement of assistance, GEOA) or minimum (Gaussian entanglement of formation, GEOF) pure entanglement that may be revealed or required between $AB$. Within this framework, a geometric necessary and sufficient entanglement condition emerges as a doubly-enclosed conic volume, defining a novel distance metric for conic optimization. Extremizing this distance for spacelike vacuum entanglement in the massless and massive free scalar fields yields (1) the highest known lower bound to GEOA, the first that remains asymptotically constant with increasing vacuum separation and (2) the lowest known upper bound to GEOF, the first that decays exponentially mirroring the mixed $AB$ negativity. Furthermore, combination of the above with a generalization of previous partially-transposed noise filtering techniques allows calculation of a single $C$ measurement that maximizes the purified $AB$ entanglement. Beyond expectation that these behaviors of spacelike GEOA and GEOF persist in interacting theories, the present measurement and optimization techniques are applicable to physical many-body Gaussian states beyond quantum fields.</description>

      <title>Vortex Detection from Quantum Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum solutions to differential equations represent quantum data -- states that contain relevant information about the system's behavior, yet are difficult to analyze. We propose a toolbox for reading out information from such data, where customized quantum circuits enable efficient extraction of flow properties. We concentrate on the process referred to as quantum vortex detection (QVD), where specialized operators are developed for pooling relevant features related to vorticity. Specifically, we propose approaches based on sliding windows and quantum Fourier analysis that provide a separation between patches of the flow field with vortex-type profiles. First, we show how contour-shaped windows can be applied, trained, and analyzed sequentially, providing a clear signal to flag the location of vortices in the flow. Second, we develop a parallel window extraction technique, such that signals from different contour positions are coherently processed to avoid looping over the entire solution mesh. We show that Fourier features can be extracted from the flow field, leading to classification of datasets with vortex-free solutions against those exhibiting Lamb-Oseen vortices. Our work exemplifies a successful case of efficiently extracting value from quantum data and points to the need for developing appropriate quantum data analysis tools that can be trained on them.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Topology in a Single-Atom Synthetic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24020v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice of a single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the synthetic lattice, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the Fock-state lattice, we introduce a topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, representing the geometric phase difference between two sublattices, can also be computed using a phase-space parameter and corresponds directly to the phase-space winding number. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties-topologically protected fermionic states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.</description>

      <title>Quantum state-transfer and periodicity in discrete-time quantum walk under non-Markovian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum communication, quantum state transfer from one location to another in a quantum network plays a prominent role, where the impact of noise could be crucial. The idea of state transfer can be fruitfully associated with quantum walk on graphs. We investigate the consequences of non-Markovian quantum noises on periodicity and state transfer induced by a discrete-time quantum walk on graphs, governed by the Grover coin operator. Different bipartite graphs, such as the path graph, cycle graph, star graph, and complete bipartite graph, present periodicity and state transfer in a discrete-time quantum walk depending on the topology of the graph. We investigate the effect of quantum non-Markovian Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) and modified non-Markovian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise (OUN) on state transfer and periodicity. We demonstrate how the RTN and OUN noises allow state transfer and periodicity for a finite number of steps in a quantum walk. Our investigation brings out the feasibility of state transfer in a noisy environment.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of drive-induced unwanted state transitions in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave drives are essential for implementing control and readout operations in superconducting quantum circuits. However, increasing the drive strength eventually leads to unwanted state transitions which limit the speed and fidelity of such operations. In this work, we systematically investigate such transitions in a fixed-frequency qubit subjected to microwave drives spanning a 9 GHz frequency range. We identify the physical origins of these transitions and classify them into three categories. (1) Resonant energy exchange with parasitic two-level systems, activated by drive-induced ac-Stark shifts, (2) multi-photon transitions to non-computational states, intrinsic to the circuit Hamiltonian, and (3) inelastic scattering processes in which the drive causes a state transition in the superconducting circuit, while transferring excess energy to a spurious electromagnetic mode or two-level system (TLS) material defect. We show that the Floquet steady-state simulation, complemented by an electromagnetic simulation of the physical device, accurately predicts the observed transitions that do not involve TLS. Our results provide a comprehensive classification of these transitions and offer mitigation strategies through informed choices of drive frequency as well as improved circuit design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle states that the maximum entropy among all quantum states with a fixed mean energy is achieved only by the thermal state of given mean energy. In this notes, we prove the maximum entropy principle for quantum processes -- the entropy of a quantum channel with fixed mean energy is maximum if and only if the channel is absolutely thermalizing channel with the fixed output thermal state of that mean energy. This allows for an alternate approach to describe emergence of the absolute thermalization processes under energy constraints in the observable universe.</description>

      <title>SQUASH: A SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to Sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a circuit-level attack, SQUASH, a SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks. SQUASH is executed by inserting SWAP gate(s) into the variational quantum circuit of the victim HQNN. Unlike conventional noise-based or adversarial input attacks, SQUASH directly manipulates the circuit structure, leading to qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution. This attack is highly stealthy, as it does not require access to training data or introduce detectable perturbations in input states. Our results demonstrate that SQUASH significantly degrades classification performance, with untargeted SWAP attacks reducing accuracy by up to 74.08\% and targeted SWAP attacks reducing target class accuracy by up to 79.78\%. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability in HQNN implementations, underscoring the need for more resilient architectures against circuit-level adversarial interventions.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel for modeling spin-motion dephasing in Rydberg chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum channel to model the dissipative dynamics resulting from the coupling between spin and motional degrees of freedom in chains of neutral atoms with Rydberg interactions. The quantum channel acts on the reduced spin state obtained under the frozen gas approximation, modulating its elements with time-dependent coefficients. These coefficients can be computed exactly in the perturbative regime, enabling efficient modeling of spin-motion dephasing in systems too large for exact methods. We benchmark the accuracy of our approach against exact diagonalization for small systems, identifying its regime of validity and the onset of perturbative breakdown. We then apply the quantum channel to compute fidelity loss during transport of single-spin excitations across extended Rydberg chains in regimes intractable via exact diagonalization. By revealing the quantum-classical crossover, these results establish a bound on the maximum chain length for efficient entanglement distribution. The quantum channel significantly reduces the complexity of simulating spin dynamics coupled to motional degrees of freedom, providing a practical tool for estimating the impact of spin-motion coupling in near-term experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a pair of particles that interact in a one-dimensional setting via a delta-function potential. One of the particles is confined to a one-dimensional box, and the other particle is free. The free particle is incident from the left with specified energy, and it may cause changes in state of the confined particle before flying away to the left or to the right. We present a non-perturbative formulation and computational scheme that determines the probability of any such outcome, as a function of the initial state of the confined particle and the energy of the incident particle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate representations of the eigenstates of an array of coupled superconducting qubits is a crucial step in the design of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED)-based quantum processors. However, exact diagonalization of the device Hamiltonian is challenging for system sizes beyond tens of qubits. Here, we employ a variant of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, DMRG-X, to efficiently obtain localized eigenstates of a 2D transmon array without the need to first compute lower-energy states. We also introduce MTDMRG-X, a new algorithm that combines DMRG-X with multi-target DMRG to efficiently compute excited states even in regimes with strong eigenstate hybridization. We showcase the use of these methods for the analysis of long-range couplings in a multi-transmon Hamiltonian including qubits and couplers, and we discuss eigenstate localization. These developments facilitate the design and parameter optimization of large-scale superconducting quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Given the ability to apply an unknown quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system, we develop a quantum algorithm for transforming its singular values. The spectrum of a quantum channel as a superoperator is naturally tied to its Liouville representation, which is in general non-Hermitian. Our key contribution is an approximate block-encoding scheme for this representation in a Hermitized form, given only black-box access to the channel; this immediately allows us to apply polynomial transformations to the channel's singular values by quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). We then demonstrate an $O(d^2/\delta)$ upper bound and an $\Omega(d/\delta)$ lower bound for the query complexity of constructing a quantum channel that is $\delta$-close in diamond norm to a block-encoding of the Hermitized Liouville representation. We show our method applies practically to the problem of learning the $q$-th singular value moments of unknown quantum channels for arbitrary $q&gt;2, q\in \mathbb{R}$, which has implications for testing if a quantum channel is entanglement breaking.</description>

      <title>Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the peculiarities of electron transport in one-dimensional (1D) disordered chain at the presence of correlations between on-site interaction and tunneling integrals. In the considered models the disorder in host-lattice sites positions is caused by presence of defects, impurities, existence of electron-phonon interaction, e.t.c. It is shown, that for certain combination of parameters the localization of electron state, inherited by a various of 1D disordered systems, disappear and electron transport becomes possible. The parameters of this transport are established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is gaining strategic relevance beyond research-driven industries. However, many companies lack the expertise to evaluate its potential for real-world applications. Traditional training formats often focus on physical principles without demonstrating practical relevance, which limits success. This paper presents a user-centered workshop concept tailored to IT professionals without prior quantum knowledge. Using a business game set in a fictitious company, participants explore quantum technologies through relatable, application-driven scenarios. The flexible design allows customization for different organizational contexts. Evaluation results from a one-day implementation at the IT-Tage 2024 indicate clear learning progress and increased awareness of practical use cases. The approach effectively bridges the gap between complex quantum concepts and industry-specific application needs.</description>

Abstract: The entanglement bootstrap program has generated new quantum numbers associated with degrees of freedom living on gapped domain walls between topological phases in two dimensions. Most fundamental among these are the so-called "parton" quantum numbers, which give rise to a zoo of composite sectors. In this note, we propose a categorical description of partons. Along the way, we make contact with ideas from generalized symmetries and SymTFT.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch Band Theory for 2D Geometry-Dependent Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by boundary-localized eigenstates under open boundary conditions, represents the key feature of the non-Hermitian lattice systems. Although the non-Bloch band theory has achieved success in depicting the NHSE in one-dimensional (1D) systems, its extension to higher dimensions encounters a fundamental hurdle in the form of the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where the energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates rely on the lattice geometry. In this work, we establish the non-Bloch band theory for two-dimensional (2D) GDSE, by introducing a strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ) framework. Through taking two sequential 1D thermodynamic limits, first along a major axis and then along a minor axis, we construct geometry-dependent non-Bloch bands, unraveling that the GDSE originates from the competition between incompatible SGBZs. Based on our theory, we derive for the first time a crucial sufficient condition for the GDSE: the non-Bloch dynamical degeneracy splitting of SGBZ eigenstates, where a continuous set of degenerate complex momenta breaks down into a discrete set. Moreover, our SGBZ formulation reveals that the Amoeba spectrum contains the union of all possible SGBZ spectra, which bridges the gap between the GDSE and the Amoeba theory. The proposed SGBZ framework offers a universal roadmap for exploring non-Hermitian effects in 2D lattice systems, opening up new avenues for the design of novel non-Hermitian materials and devices with tailored boundary behaviors.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution of two Closely-spaced Electromagnetic Fields via Walsh-Modulated Dynamical Decoupling Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to quantum fluctuations, non-orthogonal quantum states cannot be distinguished with complete certainty, making their underlying physical parameters difficult to resolve. Traditionally, it has been believed that the linewidth of a system behaves like these quantum fluctuations to set the ultimate limit on frequency resolution as two oscillating electromagnetic fields are applied. Consequently, the measurement time required to resolve a frequency difference $\Delta \omega$ was assumed to diverge as $\Delta \omega \rightarrow 0$. Here, we show that linewidth does not play a defining role in resolving two closely spaced frequencies. Instead, the ultimate limit is set by parameter-independent quantum fluctuations, such as shot noise in our case. We propose and experimentally demonstrate the first general broadband protocol for super-resolution spectroscopy. Specifically, our protocol uses a Walsh-modulated dynamical decoupling (WMDD) sequence to encode $\Delta \omega$ between two unknown tones into a quantum state. This leverages phase information to suppress parameter-independent shot noise, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio and enabling super-resolution spectroscopy. With this approach, we resolve two randomly chosen oscillating electric fields of order 100 MHz separated by 5 Hz, with a measured frequency difference of 5.0(1.6) Hz using a measurement time per run of just 1 ms, representing an improvement of 200 beyond the traditional resolution limit. As such, our technique accelerates data acquisition by more than $10^5$ magnitude compared to conventional methods. Crucially, as our protocol is rooted in the motional Raman (quantum vector signal analyzer) framework, it is effective across an arbitrary frequency range and thus promises to enhance broadband sensing of electromagnetic fields and improve spectral efficiency of next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral superfluorescence from perovskite superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluorescence (SF), a many-body quantum optics phenomenon, emerges from the collective interactions among self-organized and cooperatively coupled emitters, producing intense burst of ultrashort coherent radiation1-4. While SF has been observed in several solid-state materials5-9, the spontaneous generation of circularly polarized (CP) chiral SF has not been realized. Here, we report room-temperature chiral CP-SF originating from edge states in large-area (&gt;100 um * 100 um), transferable vertically aligned chiral quasi-2D perovskite superlattices. Theoretical quantum optics calculations reveal that chirality-induced photon transport drives the transition from initially incoherent, weakly polarized spontaneous emission to highly polarized CP-SF, amplifying the circular polarization degree up to around 14%. Notably, the polarization helicity is found to flip between forward and backward propagation directions, a characteristic signature of a macroscopic CP dipole transition. Moreover, both the intensity and polarization degree of CP-SF can be tuned under weak magnetic fields, enabling precise control over solid-state quantum light emission at room temperature. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of chirality in establishing large-scale quantum coherence within chiral superlattices, thereby unveiling promising avenues for chirality-controlled quantum spin-optical applications 10,11.</description>

      <title>Dynamically-decoupled hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy of optical clock transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyper-Ramsey protocols have been successfully implemented on ultra-narrow optical clock transitions to reduce systematic frequency-shifts induced by AC-Stark shift and amplitude pulse variation. However, the compensation remains imperfect against laser probe intensity fluctuation, decoherence and unsuited for external quasi-static or low frequency noise perturbations. Here, we address these limitations by employing dynamical-decoupling methods composed by multiple rotary Hahn-echo pulses toggling probe frequency detunings between opposite signs during interrogating laser pulses. Time-optimized Uhrig sequences of refocusing pulses produce highly contrasted and robust hyper-Ramsey interferences against low-frequency noise distortions caused by environmental factors and imperfections in the probe parameters. Dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks pave the way to universal noise-resilient quantum sensors, unveiling fault-tolerant quantum metrology to track fundamental symmetries and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Exact treatment of rotation-induced modifications in two-dimensional quantum rings</title>

Abstract: We investigate the influence of rotation on the Fermi energy, magnetization, and persistent current in two-dimensional quantum rings. Using the Tan-Inkson confinement potential and incorporating rotational effects through a non-inertial coupling, we derive analytical expressions for the energy levels and examine the modifications induced by rotation. We then numerically explore how variations in angular velocity affect the Fermi energy, magnetization, and persistent current. Our results show that rotation has a significant impact on these physical properties, underscoring the importance of considering rotational effects in quantum ring systems. This suggests that rotation could serve as a control parameter in the development of new mesoscopic devices, without the need for additional fields or geometric modifications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optical and quantum mechanical properties of a charged spinless particle confined in a two-dimensional quantum ring under the simultaneous influence of a spiral dislocation and an external magnetic field. The dislocation is modeled by a torsion-induced metric that alters the spatial geometry without introducing curvature. Using the minimal coupling procedure in curved space, we derive a modified Schr\"odinger equation incorporating both topological and electromagnetic effects. The geometric deformation leads to an energy-dependent effective potential, enabling a tunable control over the bound-state spectrum. We analyze how the spiral dislocation modifies the absorption coefficient, refractive index variation, and photoionization cross-section. The results demonstrate that the dislocation not only shifts the resonance peaks but also enhances or suppresses specific optical transitions depending on the angular momentum. These findings open up possibilities for geometrically tuning light-matter interactions in topological quantum devices.</description>

      <title>General Signal Model and Capacity Limit for Rydberg Quantum Information System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers represent a transformative approach to achieving high-sensitivity, broadband, and miniaturized radio frequency (RF) reception. However, existing static signal models for Rydberg atomic receivers rely on the steady-state assumption of atomic quantum states, which cannot fully describe the signal reception process of dynamic signals. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we present a general model to compute the dynamic signal response of Rydberg atomic receivers in closed form. Specifically, by applying small-signal perturbation techniques to the quantum master equation, we derive closed-form Laplace domain transfer functions that characterize the receiver's dynamic responses to time-varying signal fields. To gain more insights into the quantum-based RF-photocurrent conversion process, we further introduce the concept of quantum transconductance that describes the quantum system as an equivalent classical system. By applying quantum transconductance, we quantify the influence of in-band blackbody radiation (BBR) noise on the atomic receiver sensitivity. Extensive simulations for Rydberg atomic receivers validate the proposed signal model, and demonstrate the possibility of quantum receivers to outperform classical electronic receivers through the improvement of quantum transconductance.</description>

      <title>Relational entanglement entropies and quantum reference frames in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that defining gravitational entanglement entropies relative to quantum reference frames (QRFs) intrinsically regularizes them. Here, we demonstrate that such relational definitions also have an advantage in lattice gauge theories, where no ultraviolet divergences occur. To this end, we introduce QRFs for the gauge group via Wilson lines on a lattice with global boundary, realizing edge modes on the bulk entangling surface. Overcoming challenges of previous nonrelational approaches, we show that defining gauge-invariant subsystems associated with subregions relative to such QRFs naturally leads to a factorization across the surface, yielding distillable relational entanglement entropies. Distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic QRFs, according to whether they are built from the region or its complement, leads to extrinsic and intrinsic relational algebras ascribed to the region. The "electric center algebra" of previous approaches is recovered as the algebra that all extrinsic QRFs agree on, or by incoherently twirling any extrinsic algebra over the electric corner symmetry group. Similarly, a generalization of previous proposals for a "magnetic center algebra" is obtained as the algebra that all intrinsic QRFs agree on, or, in the Abelian case, by incoherently twirling any intrinsic algebra over a dual magnetic corner group. Altogether, this leads to a compelling regional algebra and relative entropy hierarchy. Invoking the corner twirls, we also find that the extrinsic/intrinsic relational entanglement entropies are upper bounded by the non-distillable electric/magnetic center entropies. Finally, using extrinsic QRFs, we discuss the influence of "asymptotic" symmetries on regional entropies. Our work thus unifies and extends previous approaches and reveals the interplay between entropies and regional symmetry structures.</description>

Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states (MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.</description>

Abstract: Quantum photonics has rapidly advanced as a key area for developing quantum technologies by harnessing photons' inherent quantum characteristics, particularly entanglement. Generation of entangled photon pairs, known as Bell states, is crucial for quantum communications, precision sensing, and quantum computing. While bulk quantum optical setups have provided foundational progress, integrated quantum photonic platforms now offer superior scalability, efficiency, and integrative potential. In this study, we demonstrate a compact and bright source of polarization-entangled Bell state utilizing continuous-wave pumping on thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) integrated photonics. Our periodically poled lithium niobate device achieves on-chip brightness of photon pair generation rate of 508.5 MHz/mW, surpassing other integrated platforms including silicon photonics. This demonstration marks the first realization of polarization entanglement on TFLN platforms. Experimentally measured metrics confirm high-quality entangled photon pairs with a purity of 0.901, a concurrence of 0.9, and a fidelity of 0.944. We expect our compact quantum devices to have great potential for advancing quantum communication systems and photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>High-mobility heavy quasiparticles in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice CeTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit high carrier mobility and tunability, making them suitable for low-power, high-performance electronic and spintronic applications. Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation effects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may impact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material with both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of optical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we observe significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature, arising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic ordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass enhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \textit{increases} and reaches $\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection. Remarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin nanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus, CeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility heavy quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic, quantum electrodynamics, as well as non-adiabatic corrections and couplings, are computed for the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$ and c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ electronic states of the helium dimer. The underlying Born-Oppenheimer potential energy curves are converged to 1 ppm ($1:10^6$) relative precision using a variational explicitly correlated Gaussian approach. % The quantum nuclear motion is computed over the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ (and B $^1\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-C $^1\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$) 9-(12-)dimensional electronic-spin subspace coupled by non-adiabatic and relativistic (magnetic) interactions. The electron's anomalous magnetic moment is also included; its effect is expected to be visible in high-resolution experiments. The computed rovibronic energy intervals are in excellent agreement with available high-resolution spectroscopy data, including the rovibronic b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-state fine structure. Fine-structure splittings are also predicted for the c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ levels, which have not been fully resolved experimentally, yet.</description>

      <title>Canonical partial ordering from min-cuts and quantum entanglement in random tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{max-flow min-cut theorem} has been recently used in the theory of random tensor networks in quantum information theory, where it is helpful for computing the behavior of important physical quantities, such as the entanglement entropy. In this paper, we extend the max-flow min-cut theorem to a relation among different \emph{partial orders} on the set of vertices of a network and introduce a new partial order for the vertices based on the \emph{min-cut structure} of the network. We apply the extended max-flow min-cut theorem to random tensor networks and find that the \emph{finite correction} to the entanglement R\'enyi entropy arising from the degeneracy of the min-cuts is given by the number of \emph{order morphisms} from the min-cut partial order to the partial order induced by non-crossing partitions on the symmetric group. Moreover, we show that the number of order morphisms corresponds to moments of a graph-dependent measure which generalizes the free Bessel law in some special cases in free probability theory.</description>

Abstract: The description of the $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded special linear Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{sl} (m_1+1,m_2|n_1,n_2)$ is carried out via generators $a_1^\pm,\ldots, a_{m_1+m_2+n_1+n_2}^\pm$ that satisfy triple relations and are called creation and annihilation operators. With respect to these generators, a class of Fock type representations of $\mathfrak{sl} (m_1+1,m_2|n_1,n_2)$ is constructed. The properties of the underlying statistics are discussed and its Pauli principle is formulated.</description>

      <title>Topological two-body interaction obstructing trivial ground states: an indicator of fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has mainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle Chern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect interaction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this work, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction projected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs. Specifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the two-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between the two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation allows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the two-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological effective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily based on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact that the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the realization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\nu = 1/3$. This result is consistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From another perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the interaction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in the context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body interactions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.</description>

      <title>Elimination of angular dependency in quantum three-body problem made easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A straightforward technique is presented to eliminate the angular dependency in a nonrelativistic quantum three-body system. Solid bipolar spherical harmonics are used as the angular basis. A correspondence relation between minimal bipolar spherical harmonics and the Wigner functions $\mathcal{D}$ is reported. This relation simplifies the evaluation of angular matrix elements compared to prior methods. A closed form of an angular matrix element is presented. The resulting radial equations are suitable for numerical estimation of the energy eigenvalues for arbitrary angular momentum and space parity states. The reported relations are validated through accurate numerical estimation of energy eigenvalues within the framework of the Ritz-variational principle using an explicitly correlated multi-exponent Hylleraas-type basis for $L=0$ to $7$ natural and for $L=1$ to $4$ unnatural space parity states of the helium atom. The results show a good agreement with the best reported values.</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of diffusive U(1)-invariant qubit circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of translationally invariant magnetization-conserving qubit circuits via the spectrum of the quasi-momentum-resolved truncated propagator of extensive observables. Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one U(1) conserved quantity.</description>

      <title>Equivalence in delegated quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.07469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delegated quantum computing (DQC) enables limited clients to perform operations that are outside their capabilities remotely on a quantum server. Protocols for DQC are usually set up in the measurement-based quantum computation framework, as this allows for a natural separation of the different parts of the computation between the client and the server. The existing protocols achieve several desired properties, including the security of inputs, the blindness of computation and its verifiability, and have also recently been extended to the multiparty setting. Two approaches are followed in DQC that demand completely different operations on the clients' side. In one, the clients are able to prepare quantum states, in the other, the clients are able to measure them. In this work, we provide a novel stringent definition of the equivalence of protocols and show that these distinct DQC settings are, in fact, equivalent in this sense. We use the abstract cryptography framework to prove our claims and provide a novel technique that enables changing from one setting to the other. In this way, we demonstrate that both approaches can be used to perform tasks with the same properties. I.e., using our proposed techniques, we can always translate from one setting to the other. We finally use our results to propose a hybrid-client model for DQC.</description>

      <title>On the formation of an interference pattern in QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12267v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of interference patterns arising when two identical particle beams intersect. By scanning a thin wire across the region of overlap, we detect the resulting interference fringes. Notably, when the wire is positioned at the center of a dark fringe, we simultaneously observe high-visibility interference and path information that appears to exceed the constraints set by the standard complementarity inequality. We show that this apparent paradox is resolved within the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Specifically, we propose that the formation of the interference pattern, and the reconciliation with complementarity, are both governed by the exchange of virtual particles. Our key finding is that particles respond to wavefunction or field directives only when the relevant conservation laws are satisfied and enforced via virtual particle exchange with external systems. This QED-based mechanism offers a unified explanation for both interference and the preservation of fundamental quantum principles.</description>

      <title>Nonclassicality in correlations without causal order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell scenarios are multipartite scenarios that exclude any signalling between parties. This leads to a strict hierarchy of classical, quantum, and non-signalling correlations in such scenarios. Here we consider a minimal relaxation of non-signalling: each party is allowed to receive a system once, implement any local intervention on it, and send out the resulting system once. Crucially, unlike Bell, we make no global assumption about causal relations between parties, e.g., they could be embedded in some exotic spacetime with indefinite causal order. We do make a causal assumption local to each party, i.e., the input received by it causally precedes the output it sends out. We then ask: Can we device-independently certify the nonclassicality of multipartite correlations in such scenarios, just as Bell inequality violations do so in Bell scenarios? A priori, this is not clear: without some assumptions on the underlying physics (e.g., non-signalling), parties can realize arbitrary correlations. We therefore make a minimal assumption of logical consistency on the underlying physics, i.e., it must be free of time-travel antinomies without imposing any restrictions on local interventions of the parties. We then define antinomicity as a device-independent notion of nonclassicality and prove a strict hierarchy between correlation sets based on their antinomicity. An antinomic correlation cannot be explained by a classical physical theory compatible with free local interventions on pain of logical contradictions in the theory. On the other hand, parties exchanging quantum systems can witness antinomicity while respecting logical consistency. Antinomicity reduces to Bell nonlocality for non-signalling parties. It also resolves a conceptual puzzle, namely, the failure of causal inequalities as witnesses of nonclassicality: antinomicity implies causal inequality violations, but not conversely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The typical bound on parameter estimation, known as the standard quantum limit (SQL), can be surpassed by exploiting quantum resources such as entanglement. To estimate the magnetic probe field, we propose a quantum sensor based on a variable-range many-body quantum spin chain with a moderate transverse magnetic field. We report the threefold benefits of employing a long-range system as a quantum sensor. First, sensors with quasi-long-range interactions can always beat the SQL for all values of the coordination number, while a sensor with long-range interactions does not have this ubiquitous quantum advantage. Second, a long-range Hamiltonian outperforms a nearest-neighbor (NN) Hamiltonian in terms of both estimating precision and system-size scaling. Finally, we observe that the system with long-range interactions can go below the SQL in the presence of a high temperature of the initial state, while sensors having NN interactions cannot. Furthermore, a sensor based on the long-range Ising Hamiltonian proves to be robust against impurities in the magnetic field and when the time-inhomogeneous dephasing noise acts during interaction of the probe with the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach for solving systems of linear equations with tensor networks based on the quantum HHL algorithm. We first develop a novel HHL in the qudits formalism, the generalization of qubits, and then transform its operations into an equivalent classical HHL, taking advantage of the non-unitary operations that they can apply. The main novelty of this proposal is to perform a classical simulation as efficiently as possible of the HHL to benchmark the algorithm steps according to its input parameters and the input matrix. We apply this algorithm to three simulation problems, comparing it with an exact inversion algorithm, and we compare its performance against an implementation of the original HHL simulated in the Qiskit framework, providing both codes. Our results show that our approach can achieve a promising performance in computational efficiency to simulate HHL process without quantum noise, providing a lower bound.</description>

Abstract: In a nonlocal game, two noncommunicating players cooperate to convince a referee that they possess a strategy that does not violate the rules of the game. Quantum strategies allow players to optimally win some games by performing joint measurements on a shared entangled state, but computing these strategies can be challenging. We present a variational quantum algorithm to compute quantum strategies for nonlocal games by encoding the rules of a nonlocal game into a Hamiltonian. We show how this algorithm can generate a short-depth optimal quantum strategy for a graph coloring game with a quantum advantage. This quantum strategy is then evaluated on fourteen different quantum hardware platforms to demonstrate its utility as a benchmark. Finally, we discuss potential sources of errors that can explain the observed decreased performance of the executed task and derive an expression for the number of samples required to accurately estimate the win rate in the presence of noise.</description>

Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate dynamics of quantum noise and its influence on the onset and mitigation of barren plateaus (BPs) - a phenomenon that critically impedes the scalability of QNNs. We find that BPs appear earlier in noisy quantum environments compared to ideal, noise-free conditions.However, strategic selection of qubit measurement observables can effectively tackle this issue. To this end, we examine a variety of observables, such as PauliZ,PauliX, PauliY, and a specially designed arbitrary Hermitian observable, tailored to the requirements of the cost function and the desired outputs of quantum circuits. Our analysis encompasses both global and local cost function definitions, with the former involving measurements across all qubits and the latter focusing on single-qubit measurements within the QNN framework. Our findings indicate that in a global cost function scenario, PauliX and PauliY observables lead to flatter optimization landscapes, signaling BPs with increasing qubits, especially in noisy conditions. Conversely, the PauliZ observable maintains trainability up to 8 qubits but encounters BPs at 10 qubits. Notably, the arbitrary Hermitian observable, when used with a global cost function, shows a unique advantage as it benefits from noise, facilitating effective training up to 10 qubits. Furthermore, with a local cost function, out of the three conventional observables (PauliX, PauliY and PauliZ), PauliZ is more effective, sustaining training efficiency under noisy conditions for up to 10 qubits, while PauliX and PauliY do not show similar benefits and remain susceptible to BPs. Our results highlight the importance of noise consideration in QNN training and propose a strategic approach to observable selection to improve QNN performance in noisy quantum computing environments thus contributing to the advancement of quantum machine learning research.</description>

Abstract: Noisy unsharp measurements incorporated in quantum information protocols may hinder performance, reducing the quantum advantage. However, we show that, unlike projective measurements which completely destroy quantum correlations between nodes in quantum networks, sequential applications of noisy measurements can mitigate the adverse impact of noise in the measurement device on quantum information processing tasks. We demonstrate this in the case of concentrating entanglement on chosen nodes in quantum networks via noisy measurements performed by assisting qubits. In the case of networks with a cluster of three or higher number of qubits, we exhibit that sequentially performing optimal unsharp measurements on the assisting qubits yields localizable entanglement between two nodes akin to that obtained by optimal projective measurements on the same assisting qubits. Furthermore, we find that the proposed approach using consecutive noisy measurements can potentially be used to prepare desired states that are resource for specific quantum schemes. We also argue that assisting qubits have greater control over the qubits on which entanglement is concentrated via unsharp measurements, in contrast to sharp measurement-based protocols, which may have implications for secure quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Postselection-free approach to monitored quantum dynamics and entanglement phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits have stimulated activity in a diverse research community. However, the study of measurement-induced dynamics, due to the requirement of exponentially complex postselection, has been experimentally limited to small or specially designed systems that can be efficiently simulated classically. We present a solution to this outstanding problem by introducing a scalable protocol in $U(1)$ symmetric circuits that facilitates the observation of entanglement phase transitions \emph{directly} from experimental data, without detailed assumptions of the underlying model or benchmarking with simulated data. Thus, the method is applicable to circuits which do not admit efficient classical simulation and allows a reconstruction of the full entanglement entropy curve with minimal theoretical input. Our approach relies on adaptive circuits and a steering protocol to approximate pure-state trajectories with mixed ensembles, from which one can efficiently filter out the subsystem $U(1)$ charge fluctuations of the target trajectory to obtain its entanglement entropy. The steering protocol replaces the exponential costs of postselection and state tomography with a scalable overhead which, for fixed accuracy $\epsilon$ and circuit size $L$, scales as $\mathcal{N}_s\sim L^{5/2}/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Certifying nonlocal properties of noisy quantum operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certifying quantum properties from the probability distributions they induce is an important task for several purposes. While this framework has been largely explored and used for quantum states, its extrapolation to the level of channels started recently in a variety of approaches. In particular, little is known about to what extent noise can spoil certification methods for channels. In this work we provide a unified methodology to certify nonlocal properties of quantum channels from the correlations obtained in prepare-and-measurement protocols: our approach gathers fully and semi-device-independent existing methods for this purpose, and extends them to new certification criteria. In addition, the effect of different models of dephasing noise is analysed. Some noise models are shown to generate nonlocality and entanglement in special cases. In the extreme case of complete dephasing, the measurement protocols discussed yield particularly simple tests to certify nonlocality, which can be obtained from known criteria by fixing the dephasing basis. These are based on the relations between bipartite quantum channels and their classical analogues: bipartite stochastic matrices defining conditional distributions.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of strong coupling of a subradiant atom array to a cavity vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering linear scattering of laser-driven cold atoms inside an undriven high-finesse optical resonator, we experimentally demonstrate effects unique to a strongly coupled vacuum field. Arranging the atoms in an incommensurate lattice with respect to the radiation wavelength, the Bragg scattering into the cavity can be suppressed by destructive interference: the atomic array is subradiant to the cavity mode under transverse illumination. We show however, that strong collective coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant polarization rotation in the linear scattering off the subradiant array via Raman scattering induced by the strongly coupled vacuum field.</description>

      <title>Phase error rate estimation in QKD with imperfect detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite-size security proof of the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol against coherent attacks, using entropic uncertainty relations, for imperfect detectors. We apply this result to the case of detectors with imperfectly characterized basis-efficiency mismatch. Our proof works by obtaining a suitable bound on the phase error rate, without requiring any new modifications to the protocol steps or hardware. It is applicable to imperfectly characterized detectors, and only requires the maximum relative difference in detection efficiencies and dark count rates of the detectors to be characterized. Moreover, our proof allows Eve to choose detector efficiencies and dark count rates in their allowed ranges in each round, thereby addressing an important problem of detector side channels. We prove security in the variable-length framework, where users are allowed to adaptively determine the length of key to be produced, and number of bits to be used for error-correction, based on observations made during the protocol. We quantitatively demonstrate the effect of basis-efficiency mismatch by applying our results to the decoy-state BB84 protocol.</description>

      <title>Chaotic and quantum dynamics in driven-dissipative bosonic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermalization in quantum many-body systems typically unfolds over timescales governed by intrinsic relaxation mechanisms. Yet, its spatial aspect is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon in the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject to coherent driving and dissipation at its boundaries, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. The dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). At intermediate drive strengths, we uncover a two-stage thermalization along the spatial dimension: phase coherence is rapidly lost near the drive, while amplitude relaxation occurs over much longer distances. This separation of scales gives rise to an extended hydrodynamic regime exhibiting anomalous temperature profiles, which we designate as a ``prethermal'' domain. At stronger drives, the system enters a nonthermal, non-chaotic finite-momentum condensate characterized by sub-Poissonian photon statistics and a spatially modulated phase profile, whose stability is undermined by quantum fluctuations. We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar mechanisms are likely to emerge in a broad class of extended driven-dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>A Photonic Parameter-shift Rule: Enabling Gradient Computation for Photonic Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for gradient computation in quantum algorithms implemented on linear optical quantum computing platforms. While parameter-shift rules have become a staple in qubit gate-based quantum computing for calculating gradients, their direct application to photonic platforms has been hindered by the non-unitary nature of differentiated phase-shift operators in Fock space. We introduce a photonic parameter-shift rule that overcomes this limitation, providing an exact formula for gradient computation in linear optical quantum processors. Our method scales linearly with the number of input photons and utilizes the same parameterized photonic circuit with shifted parameters for each evaluation. This advancement bridges a crucial gap in photonic quantum computing, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization for variational quantum algorithms on near-term photonic quantum processors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through numerical simulations in quantum chemistry and generative modeling tasks, showing superior optimization performance as well as robustness to noise from finite sampling and photon distinguishability compared to other gradient-based and gradient-free methods.</description>

      <title>Adding Photonic Entanglement to Superradiance by Using Multilevel Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show here that the photonic states emitted by ensembles of multilevel atoms via a superradiance process exhibit entanglement in the modal (frequency) degree of freedom, making this collective emission process a favorable candidate for a fast, bright and deterministic source of entangled photons. This entanglement is driven by two mechanisms: (i) selective excitation of the atomic ensemble to a superposition state and (ii) degeneracies of the optical transitions due to internal structure of the emitting atoms. The latter induces intricate non-radiative virtual transitions in the ensemble, which create interatomic correlations that are imprinted onto the emitted photons. One of the important outcomes of this complexity is the generation of mode-independent entangled multiphoton states. In addition, we study the dynamics of the correlations of the superradiating multilevel atom ensembles, and demonstrate a case where they exhibit beating in steady-state due to the aforementioned virtual transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a quantum version of neural networks with sinusoidal activation functions and compare its performance to the classical case. We create a general quantum sine circuit implementing a discretised sinusoidal activation function. Along the way, we define a classical discrete sinusoidal neural network. We build a quantum optimization algorithm around the quantum sine circuit, combining quantum search and phase estimation. This algorithm is guaranteed to find the weights with global minimum loss on the training data. We give a computational complexity analysis and demonstrate the algorithm in an example. We compare the performance with that of the standard gradient descent training method for classical sinusoidal neural networks. We show that (i) the standard classical training method typically leads to bad local minima in terms of mean squared error on test data and (ii) the weights that perform best on the training data generalise well to the test data. Points (i) and (ii) motivate using the quantum training algorithm, which is guaranteed to find the best weights on the training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Heisenberg's uncertainty relation relative to a quantum reference frame (QRF). We introduce the QRF as a covariant phase-space observable, show that when described relative to it, position and momentum appear compatible, and derive novel, frame-relative uncertainty relations. This is achieved by constructing a joint observable for position and momentum, and calculating the variances of its margins. We then verify that in the classical limit of the QRF, the standard uncertainty relations are recovered, fortifying claims that standard quantum theory must be understood relative to an external, classical frame. These results may open up new research directions at the interface between QRFs and incompatibility.</description>

Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: Quantum technologies offer ways to solve certain tasks more quickly, efficiently, and with greater precision than their classical counterparts. Yet substantial challenges remain in the construction of sufficiently error-free and scalable quantum platforms needed to unlock any real benefits to society. Acknowledging that this hardware can take vastly different forms, our review here focuses on so-called spintronic (\textit{i.e.}~spin-electronic) materials that use electronic or nuclear spins to embody qubits. Towards helping the reader to spot trends and pick winners, we have surveyed the various families of optically addressable spin qubits and attempted to benchmark and identify the most promising ones in each. We go on to reveal further trends that demonstrate how qubit lifetimes depend on the material's synthesis, the concentration/distribution of its embedded qubits, and the experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Dynamic Range of Sub-Quantum-Limit Measurements via Quantum Deamplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15061v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a 50 percent threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. Next, we perform a similar analysis for a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, the lift-connected surface code. We find a 50 percent threshold under erasure errors alone and, for the first time, derive the exact statistical mechanics mappings in the presence of both computational and erasure errors. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds for code classes beyond topological codes under realistic noise, and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.</description>

      <title>Decoding Quantum LDPC Codes using Collaborative Check Node Removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault tolerance of quantum protocols require on-par contributions from error-correcting codes and its suitable decoders. One of the most explored error-correcting codes is the family of Quantum Low-Density Parity Check (QLDPC) codes. Although faster than many of the reported decoders for QLDPC codes, iterative decoders fails to produce suitable success rates due to the colossal degeneracy and short cycles intrinsic to these codes. We present a strategy to improve the performance of the iterative decoders based on a collaborative way to use the message passing of the iterative decoders and stabilizer check node removal from the quantum code's Tanner graph. We particularly introduce a notion of qubit separation, which gives us a metric to analyze and improve the min-sum Belief Propagation (BP) based iterative decoder's performance towards harmful configurations of QLDPC codes. We further show that an integration of information measurements (IM) for qubits and it's adjacent stabilizer checks, can be exploited to extract far better performing results from the collaborative decoding architecture compared to its classical predecessor. We analyze the performance of the proposed collaborative decoding architecture, in the context of Generalized Hypergraph Product (GHP) codes. We discuss that the collaborative decoding architecture overcomes iterative decoding failures regarding the harmful trapping set configurations by increasing the separation of trapped qubits without incurring any significant overhead.</description>

      <title>Real-time adaptation of quantum noise channel estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimates of noise channels for quantum gates are required for most error mitigation techniques and are desirable for informing quantum error correction decoders. These estimates can be obtained by resource-intensive off-line characterization techniques, but can become stale due to device drift and fluctuations. We propose a method to address this issue by performing real-time adaptation of noise channel estimates during the execution of a quantum algorithmic circuit using extended flag gadgets, mid-circuit measurements and Bayesian inference. We carry out analytical calculations and numerical simulations employing a Dirichlet prior distribution for the error rates in a Pauli channel to demonstrate and evaluate the technique, which can be seen as a protocol for real-time calibration of high-level gate error information.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state geometric phases of coherent and squeezed spin states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07268v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric geometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. Exact solutions and numerical results of selected examples are presented. For the $j = 3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase exhibits finite-temperature topological phase transitions characterized by abrupt jumps. The IGP for the same state similarly shows discontinuous jumps as the temperature varies. In the case of the $j = 1$ one-axis SSS, both Uhlmann phase and IGP display discrete finite-temperature jumps. By contrast, the $j = 1$ two-axis SSS shows no such transitions because the Uhlmann phase and IGP both vary smoothly with temperature. We also briefly discuss potential realizations and simulations related to these phenomena in spin systems.</description>

      <title>Indefinite Time Directed Quantum Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the performance of the metrology scheme by employing a quantum time flip during encoding, a specific case of processes with indefinite time direction, which we refer to as indefinite time directed metrology (ITDM). In the case of single parameter estimation of a unitary, we demonstrate that our protocol can achieve Heisenberg scaling (1/N) with product probe states, surpassing the standard quantum limit (1/\sqrt{N}), where N is the number of particles in the probe. We establish this by computing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) which is a lower bound on the root mean square error occurred during parameter estimation. Although we analytically prove the optimality of the symmetric product probe state in ITDM, entangled probe states produce a higher QFI than optimal product probes without enhancing scaling, highlighting the non-essentiality of entanglement. For phase estimation, we propose a single-qubit measurement on the control qubit that accomplishes near-optimal Fisher information and eventually reaches Heisenberg scaling. Our findings reveal the best orientation of product probe states in every pertinent situation, emphasizing its independence from the parameter to be estimated in the limiting case. Furthermore, we illustrate the benefits of ITDM in noisy metrology, outperforming existing techniques in some situations.</description>

      <title>Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Statistical RF Fields at High Magnetic Field with a Quantum Sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely used in fields ranging from chemistry, material science to neuroscience. Nanoscale NMR spectroscopy using Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a promising platform due to an unprecedented sensitivity down to the single spin level. At the nanoscale, high nuclear spin polarization through spin fluctuations (statistical polarization) far outweighs thermal polarization. However, until now efficient NMR detection using coherent averaging techniques could not be applied to the detection of statistical polarization, leading to long measurement times. Here we present two protocols to enable coherent averaging of statistical oscillating signals through rectification. We demonstrate these protocols on an artificial radiofrequency signal detected with a single NV center at 2.7 T. Through this, the signal-to-noise scaling with number of measurements $N$ is improved from $N^{0.5}$ to $N^1$, improving the measurement time significantly. The relevance of rectification for the detection of statistical polarization using NV ensembles is outlined, paving the way for efficient nanoscale NMR spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving $SU(2)$ matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explored and experimented with new forms of parameterized quantum circuits to be used as variational ansatzes for solving the bosonic and supersymmetric $SU(2)$ matrix models at different couplings using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz can outperform the popular EfficientSU2 circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to EfficientSU2 in the setting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regime of the bosonic model, both TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground state, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits, with a small number of parameters, attained a comparable or even better performance compared to the much deeper EfficientSU2 circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz quantum circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently in future VQE studies of quantum physics systems.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine with a qutrit as the working substance interacting with a quantum scalar field in curved spacetime. Unlike qubits, which extract work by simply expanding or shrinking a single energy gap, qutrits allow multiple energy gaps to be adjusted independently, enabling more versatile work extraction in the quantum Otto cycle. We derive a general positive work condition in terms of the effective temperature that each pair of energy levels perceives. Moreover, we discuss additional subtleties that are absent when using a qubit, such as the generation of coherence terms in the density matrix due to interactions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Transformers integrate the representational power of classical Transformers with the computational advantages of quantum computing. Since 2022, research in this area has rapidly expanded, giving rise to diverse technical paradigms and early applications. To address the growing need for consolidation, this paper presents the first comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth survey of quantum Transformer models. First, we delineate the research scope, focusing on improving Transformer parts with quantum methods, and introduce foundational concepts in classical Transformers and quantum machine learning. Then we organize existing studies into two main paradigms: PQC-based and QLA-based, with PQC-based paradigm further divided into QKV-only Quantum Mapping, Quantum Pairwise Attention, Quantum Holistic Attention. and Quantum-Assisted Optimization, analyzing their core mechanisms and architectural traits. We also summarize empirical results that demonstrate preliminary quantum advantages, especially on small-scale tasks or resource-constrained settings. Following this, we examine key technical challenges, such as complexity-resource trade-offs, scalability and generalization limitations, and trainability issues including barren plateaus, and provide potential solutions, including quantumizing classical transformer variants with lower complexity, hybrid designs, and improved optimization strategies. Finally, we propose several promising future directions, e.g., scaling quantum modules into large architectures, applying quantum Transformers to domains with inherently quantum data (e.g., physics, chemistry), and developing theory-driven designs grounded in quantum information science. This survey will help researchers and practitioners quickly grasp the overall landscape of current quantum Transformer research and promote future developments in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Dimensional Factorization Limits in Discrete Diffusion Models through Quantum Joint Distribution Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models represent a significant advance in generative modeling, demonstrating remarkable success in synthesizing complex, high-quality discrete data. However, to avoid exponential computational costs, they typically rely on calculating per-dimension transition probabilities when learning high-dimensional distributions. In this study, we rigorously prove that this approach leads to a worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces, offering a theoretical pathway to faithfully capture the true joint distribution. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit that utilizes temporal information for parameter sharing and incorporates learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage in joint distribution learning.</description>

      <title>Unraveling superradiance: Entanglement and mutual information in collective decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</description>

Abstract: A Hamiltonian with eigenvalues $E_n = \rho_n(1-\rho_n) $ has been constructed, where $\rho_n $ denotes the $n-$th non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. To construct such a Hamiltonian, we generalize the Berry-Keating's paradigm and encode number-theoretic information into the Hamiltonian through modular forms. Even though our construction does not resolve the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture -- since the eigenstates corresponding to $E_n$ are \emph{not} normalizable states -- it offers a novel physical perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis(RH). Especially, we proposed a physical statement of RH, which may serve as a potential pathway toward its proof.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms hold great promise for solving quantum control problems on near-term quantum computers. In this work, we employ the hybrid framework that integrates digital quantum simulation with classical optimization to achieve optimal engineering of quantum many-body systems. To evaluate the overall performance of this method, we introduce a general metric termed control optimality, which accounts for constraints on both classical and quantum components. As a concrete example, we investigate the time-optimal control for perfect state transfer in a one-dimensional spin model using the variational quantum algorithm, closely approaching the quantum speed limit. Moreover, we discuss the emergent gradient behavior and error robustness, demonstrating the feasibility of applying hybrid quantum algorithms to solve quantum optimal control problems. These results establish a systematic framework for hybrid algorithms to address quantum control problems on near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Old Quantum Mechanics by Bohr and Sommerfeld from a Modern Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00408v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review Bohr's atomic model and its extension by Sommerfeld from a mathematical perspective of wave mechanics. The derivation of quantization rules and energy levels is revisited using semiclassical methods. Sommerfeld-type integrals are evaluated by elementary techniques, and connections with the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations are established. Historical developments and key transitions from classical to quantum theory are discussed to clarify the structure and significance of the old quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Controlled Quantum Gates in Linear Nearest Neighbor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-controlled single-target (MC) gates are some of the most crucial building blocks for varied quantum algorithms. How to implement them optimally is thus a pivotal question. To answer this question in an architecture-independent manner, and to get a worst-case estimate, we should look at a linear nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, as this can be embedded in almost any qubit connectivity. Motivated by the above, here we describe a method which implements MC gates using no more than $\sim 4k+8n$ CNOT gates -- up-to $60\%$ reduction over state-of-the-art -- while allowing for complete flexibility to choose the locations of $n$ controls, the target, and a dirty ancilla out of $k$ qubits. More strikingly, in case $k \approx n$, our upper bound is $\sim 12n$ -- the best known for unrestricted connectivity -- and if $n = 1$, our upper bound is $\sim 4k$ -- the best known for a single long-range CNOT gate over $k$ qubits -- therefore, if our upper bound can be reduced, then the cost of one or both of these simpler versions of MC gates will be immediately reduced accordingly. In practice, our method provides circuits that tend to require fewer CNOT gates than our upper bound for almost any given instance of MC gates.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of quantum computation to topological data analysis (TDA) has received growing attention. While estimating Betti numbers is a central task in TDA, general complexity theoretic limitations restrict the possibility of quantum speedups. To address this, we explore quantum algorithms under a more structured input model. We show that access to additional topological information enables improved quantum algorithms for estimating Betti and persistent Betti numbers. Building on this, we introduce a new approach based on homology tracking, which avoids computing the kernel of combinatorial Laplacians used in prior methods. This yields a framework that remains efficient even when Betti numbers are small, offering substantial and sometimes exponential speedups. Beyond Betti number estimation, we formulate and study the homology property testing problem, and extend our approach to the cohomological setting. We present quantum algorithms for testing triviality and distinguishing homology classes, revealing new avenues for quantum advantage in TDA.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Capacity of Decohering Channels in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact analytical expressions for the quantum capacity of a broad class of decohering quantum channels of the form $\Lambda(\rho)=(1-x)\rho + x D(\rho)$, where $D(\rho)$ represents a structured decoherence process. These channels are shown to be degradable for all noise parameters and in arbitrary dimensions, yielding closed-form, single-letter capacity formulas. Our analysis includes fully decohering, block-decohering, and weakly decohering channels, the latter involving coherence preservation within overlapping subspaces. Surprisingly, even under maximal decoherence, the channel may retain nonzero capacity due to residual coherence structure. These results provide quantitative role for decoherence-free and partially coherent subspaces in preserving quantum information, offering guidance for encoding strategies in quantum memories and fault-tolerant quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider several definitions of the quantum Wasserstein distance based on an optimization over general bipartite quantum states with given marginals. Then, we examine the quantities obtained after the optimization is carried out over bipartite separable states instead. We prove that several of these quantities are equal to each other. Thus, we connect several approaches in the literature. We prove the triangle inequality for some of these quantities for the case of one of the three states being pure. As a byproduct, we show that the Uhlmann-Jozsa quantum fidelity can also be written as an optimization over separable states with given marginals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system in the course of a gedanken scattering experiment. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the scattering matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.</description>

      <title>Rabi transport and the other finite-size effects in one-dimensional discrete-time topological quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Rabi transport and finite-size effects in one-dimensional discrete-time topological quantum walks. We demonstrate the emergence of localized states at boundaries between topologically distinct phases and analyze how finite system sizes influence quantum walk dynamics. For finite lattices, we show that topology induces localized and bilocalized states, leading to Rabi-like transport as a result of degeneracy breaking due to finite-size effects. The study bridges the gap between topological protection and size-dependent dynamics, revealing transitions from ballistic motion to localized or oscillatory behavior based on the system's topological properties. Analytical and numerical methods are employed to explore the spectra and dynamics of quantum walks, highlighting the robustness of Rabi transport against disorder. The findings provide insights into controlled quantum transport and potential applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Spin squeezing generation in atom-cavity systems: on the effects of adiabatic elimination beyond the leading order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-squeezed states are a prototypical example of metrologically useful quantum states where structured entanglement allows for enhanced sensing with respect to that possible using classically correlated particles. Key challenges include the efficient preparation of spin-squeezed states and the scalability of estimation precision with the number $N$ of probes. Recently, in the context of the generation of spin-squeezed states via coupling of three-level atoms to an optical cavity, it was shown that increasing the atom-cavity coupling can be detrimental to spin-squeezing generation, an effect that is not captured by the standard second-order adiabatic cavity removal approximation. We describe adiabatic elimination techniques to derive an effective Lindblad master equation up to third order for the atomic degrees of freedom. We then show through numerical simulations that the spin-squeezing scalability loss is correctly reproduced by the reduced open system dynamics, pinpointing the relevant role of higher-order contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurement of the pairing gap plays an essential role in studying the physical properties of superconductors or superfluids. We develop a strategy for measure the pairing gap through the dynamical excitations. With the random phase approximation (RPA), the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model are studied by calculating the dynamical structure factor. Two distinct collective modes are investigated: a Goldstone phonon mode at the transferred momentum ${\bf q}=\left[0,0\right]$ and a roton mode at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$. The roton mode demonstrates a sharp molecular peak in the low-energy regime. Remarkably, the area under the roton molecular peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which persists even in three-dimensional and spin-orbit coupled (SOC) optical lattices. This result provides a potential strategy to measure the pairing gap of lattice systems experimentally by measuring the dynamical structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modelling of quantum dot qubits: Coupling, gate dynamics and robustness versus charge noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron spins in semiconductor devices are highly promising building blocks for quantum processors (QPs). Commercial semiconductor foundries can create QPs using the same processes employed for conventional chips, once the QP design is suitably specified. There is a vast accessible design space; to identify the most promising options for fabrication, one requires predictive modelling of interacting electrons in real geometries and complex non-ideal environments. In this work we explore a modelling method based on real-space grids, an ab initio approach without assumptions relating to device topology and therefore with wide applicability. Given an electrode geometry, we determine the exchange coupling between quantum dot qubits, and model the full evolution of a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate to predict qubit loss and infidelity rates for various voltage profiles. We determine full, 3D solutions and introduce a method which can obtain near-identical predictions using far more efficient 2D computations. Moreover we explore the impact of unwanted charge defects (static and dynamic) in the environment, and test robust pulse sequences. As an example we exhibit a sequence correcting both systematic errors and (unknown) charge defects, observing an order of magnitude boost in fidelity. The technique can thus identify the most promising device designs for fabrication, as well as bespoke control sequences for each such device.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation between Unruh-DeWitt detectors in the de Sitter spacetime-analysis with complex scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement generation or harvesting between two identical, comoving Unruh-DeWitt detectors in the cosmological de Sitter spacetime. The detectors are assumed to be unentangled initially. They are individually coupled to a complex scalar field, which eventually leads to coupling between themselves. Two kinds of complex scalar fields are investigated here-conformally invariant and massless minimally coupled. By tracing out the degrees of freedom corresponding to the scalar, we construct the reduced density matrix for the two detectors, whose eigenvalues characterise transition probabilities between the energy levels of the detectors. We have computed the negativity, quantifying the degree of entanglement generated at late times between the two detectors. The similarities and differences of these results between the aforementioned two kinds of scalar fields have been discussed. We also compare our results with the existing result of the real scalar field, and point out the qualitative differences. In particular, we emphasise that entanglement harvesting is more resilient in scenarios involving complex fields and nonlinear couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization and characterization of a novel magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color optical dipole trap for cesium that allows us to generate two diametral periodic one-dimensional arrays of trapping sites with a spacing significantly smaller than half the resonant free-space wavelength of the cesium D2 transition. This is achieved by launching a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light fields through the nanofiber. We trap and optically interface the atoms in the resulting periodic optical potential and characterize the trap by measuring the lifetime of the trapped atoms, the atom-light coupling strength, the filling factor, and the trap frequencies in the radial and axial directions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with magic trapping wavelengths and sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing is an important step towards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects, such as selective radiance.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quasi-planar defects using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of the electron density and relative energy with respect to a perfect crystal of a class of volume defects that are compactly contained along one direction while being of infinite extent along the other two using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker (TFW) model. We take advantage of prior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW setting, and specialize it to the case of quasi-planar defects. In particular, we prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal with respect to a perfect crystal is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization problem. In order to show the existence of the minimization problem, we modify the TFW theory for thin films and establish convergence of the electronic fields due to the perturbation caused by the quasi-planar defect. We also show that perturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the presence of the quasi-planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect, in agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these results to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular the finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical calculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the (non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the Dirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for future work.</description>

      <title>The Streda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Cesaro Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The St\v{r}eda formula establishes a fundamental connection between the topological invariants characterizing the bulk of topological matter and the presence of gapless edge modes. In this work, we extend the St\v{r}eda formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems, while offering a link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response is regularized through Ces\`aro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk, and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally-invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.</description>

      <title>Persistent currents in ultracold gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents flowing in spatially closed tracks define one of the most iconic concepts in mesoscopic physics. They have been studied in solid-state platforms such as superfluids, superconductors and metals. Cold atoms trapped in magneto-optical toroidal circuits and driven by suitable artificial gauge fields allow us to study persistent currents with unprecedented control and flexibility of the system's physical conditions. Here, we review persistent currents of ultracold matter. Capitalizing on the remarkable progress in driving different atomic species to quantum degeneracy, persistent currents of single or multicomponent bosons/fermions, and their mixtures can be addressed within the present experimental know-how. This way, fundamental concepts of quantum science and many-body physics, like macroscopic quantum coherence, solitons, vortex dynamics, fermionic pairing and BEC-BCS crossover can be studied from a novel perspective. Finally, we discuss how persistent currents can form the basis of new technological applications like matter-wave gyroscopes and interferometers.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian entanglement asymmetry in random states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry measures the extent to which a symmetry is broken within a subsystem of an extended quantum system. Here, we analyse this quantity in Haar random states for arbitrary compact, semi-simple Lie groups, building on and generalising recent results obtained for the $U(1)$ symmetric case. We find that, for any symmetry group, the average entanglement asymmetry vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when the subsystem is smaller than its complement. When the subsystem and its complement are of equal size, the entanglement asymmetry jumps to a finite value, indicating a sudden transition of the subsystem from a fully symmetric state to one devoid of any symmetry. For larger subsystem sizes, the entanglement asymmetry displays a logarithmic scaling with a coefficient fixed by the dimension of the group. We also investigate the fluctuations of the entanglement asymmetry, which tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit. We check our findings against exact numerical calculations for the $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ groups. We further discuss their implications for the thermalisation of isolated quantum systems and black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Engineering spectro-temporal light states with physics-embedded deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency synthesis and spectro-temporal control of optical wave packets are central to ultrafast science, with supercontinuum (SC) generation standing as one remarkable example. Through passive manipulation, femtosecond (fs) pulses from nJ-level lasers can be transformed into octave-spanning spectra, supporting few-cycle pulse outputs when coupled with external pulse compressors. While strategies such as machine learning have been applied to control the SC's central wavelength and bandwidth, their success has been limited by the nonlinearities and strong sensitivity to measurement noise. Here, we propose and demonstrate how a physics-embedded convolutional neural network (P-CNN) that embeds spectro-temporal correlations can circumvent such challenges, resulting in faster convergence and reduced noise sensitivity. This innovative approach enables on-demand control over spectro-temporal features of SC, achieving few-cycle pulse shaping without external compressors. This approach heralds a new era of arbitrary spectro-temporal light state engineering, with implications for ultrafast photonics, photonic neuromorphic computation, and AI-driven optical systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for commuting long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have revealed the intricate effect of long-range interactions on information transport in quantum many-body systems: In $D$ spatial dimensions, interactions decaying as a power-law $r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha &gt; 2 D+1$ exhibit a Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) with a linear light cone and the threshold $2D +1$ is sharp in general. Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form $t \, r^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha&gt;0$, and this scaling is sharp. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at $\alpha = 1$ in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.</description>

      <title>Anomalous geometric transport signatures of topological Euler class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Riemannian quantum-geometric structures in semiclassical transport features of two-dimensional multigap topological phases. In particular, we study nonlinear Hall-like bulk electric current responses and, accordingly, semiclassical equations of motion induced by the presence of a topological Euler invariant. We provide analytic understanding of these quantities by phrasing them in terms of momentum-space geodesics and geodesic deviation equations and further corroborate these insights with numerical solutions. Within this framework, we moreover uncover anomalous bulk dynamics associated with the second- and third-order nonlinear Hall conductivities induced by a patch Euler invariant. As a main finding, our results show how one can reconstruct the Euler invariant by coupling to electric fields at nonlinear order and from the gradients of the electric fields. Furthermore, we comment on the possibility of deducing the nontrivial non-Abelian Euler class invariant specifically in second-order nonlinear ballistic conductance measurements within a triple-contact setup, which was recently proposed to probe the Euler characteristics of more general Fermi surfaces. Generally, our results provide a route for deducing the topology in real materials that exhibit the Euler invariant by analyzing bulk electrical currents.</description>

      <title>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, ferromagnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. In addition to exploring understudied lattices, our contribution comprehensively analyzes the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding: Advancing Recovery Rate Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15828v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies by enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, accurate forecasting remains challenging due to complex nonlinear dependencies, high-dimensional feature spaces, and limited sample sizes-conditions under which classical machine learning models are prone to overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning (QML) model with Amplitude Encoding, leveraging the unitarity constraint of Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQC) and the exponential data compression capability of qubits. We evaluate the model on a global recovery rate dataset comprising 1,725 observations and 256 features from 1996 to 2023. Our hybrid method significantly outperforms both classical neural networks and QML models using Angle Encoding, achieving a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.228, compared to 0.246 and 0.242, respectively. It also performs competitively with ensemble tree methods such as XGBoost. While practical implementation challenges remain for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, our quantum simulation and preliminary results on noisy simulators demonstrate the promise of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in enhancing the accuracy and robustness of recovery rate forecasting. These findings illustrate the potential of quantum machine learning in shaping the future of credit risk prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.</description>

Abstract: Quantum scars have recently been directly visualized in graphene quantum dots (Nature 635, 841 (2024)), revealing their resilience and influence on electron dynamics in mesoscopic systems. Here, we examine variational scarring in two-dimensional quantum dots and demonstrate that these states remain robust even in an open system. We show that controlled perturbations enable modulation of electronic transmission via scarred states, presenting a viable approach to tuning quantum transport. These findings provide insights into the role of scarring in mesoscopic transport and open pathways for experimental realization in quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.</description>

      <title>Genuine multi-entropy and holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07995v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is bipartite entanglement sufficient for holography? Through the analysis of the Markov gap, it is known that the answer is no. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this issue from a different angle using a multi-entropy. We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} &lt; \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</description>

Abstract: Since the first experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensates in a spin-orbit-coupled Zeeman lattice, a wide range of applications have been found in these systems. Here, we systematically study the ground-state phase diagram of the systems. We address that the band-edge phase in the ground-state phase diagram is exotic and exists in a very broad parameter regime. The superfluidity of the band-edge states is identified by elementary excitations and superfluid fraction.</description>

      <title>Quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entangled vortex filaments are essential to turbulence, serving as coherent structures that govern nonlinear fluid dynamics and support the reconstruction of fluid fields to reveal statistical properties. This study introduces an quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence, employing a level-set method that models the filaments as the intersection of the real and imaginary zero iso-surfaces of a complex scalar field. Describing the fluid field via the scalar field offers distinct advantages in capturing complex structures, topological properties, and fluid dynamics, while opening new avenues for innovative solutions through quantum computing platforms. The representation is reformulated into an eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices, enabling the conversion of velocity fields into complex scalar fields that embed the vortex filaments. The resulting optimization is addressed using a variational quantum eigensolver, with Pauli operator truncation and deep learning techniques applied to improve efficiency and reduce noise. The proposed quantum framework achieves a near-linear time complexity and a exponential storage reduction while maintaining a balance of accuracy, robustness, and versatility, presenting a promising tool for turbulence analysis, vortex dynamics research, and machine learning dataset generation.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Hermiticity, Anti-Pseudo-Hermiticity, and Generalized Parity-Time-Reversal Symmetry at Exceptional Points</title>

Abstract: For a diagonalizable linear operator $H:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ acting in a separable Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, i.e., an operator with a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of eigenvectors that form a Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$, the pseudo-Hermiticity of $H$ is equivalent to its generalized parity-time-reversal ($PT$) symmetry, where the latter means the existence of an antilinear operator $X:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $[X,H]=0$ and $X^2=1$. {The original proof of this result makes use of the anti-pesudo-Hermiticity of every diagonalizable operator $L:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$, which means the existence of an antilinear Hermitian bijection $\tau:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $L^\dagger=\tau L\,\tau^{-1}$. We establish the validity of this result for block-diagonalizable operators}, i.e., those which have a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of generalized eigenvectors that form a Jordan Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$. {This allows us to generalize the original proof of the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $PT$-symmetry for diagonalizable operators to block-diagonalizable operators. For a pair of pseudo-Hermitian operators acting respectively in two-dimensional and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we obtain explicit expressions for the antlinear operators $\tau$ and $X$ that realize their anti-pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $PT$-symmetry at and away from the exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength micromachined vapor-cell based Rydberg sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, micromachined vapor cells have been revolutionizing the field of chip-scale quantum sensors such as magnetometers and atomic clocks. In parallel, Rydberg atomic quantum sensing has emerged as a powerful technique for broadband, non-invasive and ultra-sensitive electrometry. Yet, to date, Rydberg sensing has largely been limited to glass-blown, centimeter-scale vapor cells. Here, we perform Rydberg spectroscopy using a wafer-scale fabricated Pyrex-Si-Pyrex cell with millimeter-scale dimensions. The Rydberg spectroscopic line is characterized with respect to critical parameters such as temperature, the frequency and amplitude of the applied radiofrequency field, light intensity, and the spatial position of the interrogating beam. Our study reveals lineshapes directly influenced by a complex landscape of electrostatic fields with values up to approximately 0.6 V/cm. By controlling key parameters, we were able to reduce the effect of these internal electric fields and demonstrate the detection of RF fields with a sensitivity as low as $10\,\mu\mathrm{V/cm}$ These results highlight the potential of micromachined vapor cells for sub-wavelength electromagnetic field measurements, with applications in communications, near-field RF imaging, and chip-scale quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Cryptography from Lossy Reductions: Towards OWFs from ETH, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-way functions (OWFs) form the foundation of modern cryptography, yet their unconditional existence remains a major open question. In this work, we study this question by exploring its relation to lossy reductions, i.e., reductions $R$ for which it holds that $I(X;R(X)) \ll n$ for all distributions $X$ over inputs of size $n$. Our main result is that either OWFs exist or any lossy reduction for any promise problem $\Pi$ runs in time $2^{\Omega(\log\tau_\Pi / \log\log n)}$, where $\tau_\Pi(n)$ is the infimum of the runtime of all (worst-case) solvers of $\Pi$ on instances of size $n$. In fact, our result requires a milder condition, that $R$ is lossy for sparse uniform distributions (which we call mild-lossiness). It also extends to $f$-reductions as long as $f$ is a non-constant permutation-invariant Boolean function, which includes And-, Or-, Maj-, Parity-, Modulo$_k$, and Threshold$_k$-reductions.
  Additionally, we show that worst-case to average-case Karp reductions and randomized encodings are special cases of mildly-lossy reductions and improve the runtime above as $2^{\Omega(\log \tau_\Pi)}$ when these mappings are considered. Restricting to weak fine-grained OWFs, this runtime can be further improved as $\Omega(\tau_\Pi)$. Taking $\Pi$ as $kSAT$, our results provide sufficient conditions under which (fine-grained) OWFs exist assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Conversely, if (fine-grained) OWFs do not exist, we obtain impossibilities on instance compressions (Harnik and Naor, FOCS 2006) and instance randomizations of $kSAT$ under the ETH.
  Finally, we partially extend these findings to the quantum setting; the existence of a pure quantum mildly-lossy reduction for $\Pi$ within the runtime $2^{o(\log\tau_\Pi / \log\log n)}$ implies the existence of one-way state generators.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Computational Perspective on Spread Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a direct connection between spread complexity and quantum circuit complexity by demonstrating that spread complexity emerges as a limiting case of a circuit complexity framework built from two fundamental operations: time-evolution and superposition. Our approach leverages a computational setup where unitary gates and beam-splitting operations generate target states, with the minimal cost of synthesis yielding a complexity measure that converges to spread complexity in the infinitesimal time-evolution limit. This perspective not only provides a physical interpretation of spread complexity but also offers computational advantages, particularly in scenarios where traditional methods like the Lanczos algorithm fail. We illustrate our framework with an explicit SU(2) example and discuss broader applications, including cases where return amplitudes are non-perturbative or divergent</description>

      <title>Open quantum battery in three-dimensional rotating black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the charging performance of a quantum battery (QB) coupled to a scalar field under the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole. It is shown that under Dirichlet boundary conditions, when the QB's energy level spacing is smaller than the charging amplitude, the black hole rotation enhances the charging performance at finite times, whereas in other parameter regimes, it degrades the charging performance. Notably, as the black hole approaches extremal rotation, charging performance undergoes significant amplification or suppression, depending on the parameter regime. This indicates that the performance of QBs can probe critical properties of black holes. Additionally, regarding the energy flow in QB, it is further demonstrated that the energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations via dissipation, and rotation suppresses the QB's capacity to extract this energy. Our findings not only advance the relativistic dissipation dynamics of QBs but also propose a novel method to detect black hole rotation and extremal-state transitions.</description>

      <title>Observation of many-body coherence in quasi-one-dimensional attractive Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic coherence is an important feature of quantum many-body systems exhibiting collective behaviors, with examples ranging from atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and quantum liquids to superconductors. Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Annealing Approach for Solving Optimal Feature Selection and Next Release Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search-based software engineering (SBSE) addresses critical optimization challenges in software engineering, including the next release problem (NRP) and feature selection problem (FSP). While traditional heuristic approaches and integer linear programming (ILP) methods have demonstrated efficacy for small to medium-scale problems, their scalability to large-scale instances remains unknown. Here, we introduce quantum annealing (QA) as a subroutine to tackling multi-objective SBSE problems, leveraging the computational potential of quantum systems. We propose two QA-based algorithms tailored to different problem scales. For small-scale problems, we reformulate multi-objective optimization (MOO) as single-objective optimization (SOO) using penalty-based mappings for quantum processing. For large-scale problems, we employ a decomposition strategy guided by maximum energy impact (MEI), integrating QA with a steepest descent method to enhance local search efficiency. Applied to NRP and FSP, our approaches are benchmarked against the heuristic NSGA-II and the ILP-based $\epsilon$-constraint method. Experimental results reveal that while our methods produce fewer non-dominated solutions than $\epsilon$-constraint, they achieve significant reductions in execution time. Moreover, compared to NSGA-II, our methods deliver more non-dominated solutions with superior computational efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of QA in advancing scalable and efficient solutions for SBSE challenges.</description>

      <title>Observing Laughlin's pump using quantized edge states in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>
