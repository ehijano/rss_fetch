      <title>Defect density quantification in monolayer MoS2 using helium atom micro-diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur vacancy defects mediate a wide range of optoelectronic properties in MoS2, with precise control of defect density allowing for tuneable optoelectronic devices. However, accurate measurement of defect density in monolayer and few-layer samples poses a challenge due to their small scattering cross-sections to photon or electron probes. Conventional lab-based techniques such as Raman and photoluminescence can infer approximate defect density in micro-scale samples via optoelectronic properties, but they require validation using stoichiometric beam-line XPS. We introduce an ultra-low energy (~64 meV) and non-intrusive lab-based technique to quantify the surface defect density in micron-scale monolayer MoS2. Here we show that a recently developed technique, helium atom micro-diffraction (referred to as scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) in literature), can be used to directly measure vacancy-type defect density in 2D materials by performing atom diffraction from a microscopic spot. SHeM uses a neutral, inert, and thermal energy probe of helium-4 atoms to measure ordered and disordered atom-surface scattering allowing the level of surface order to be inferred. The presented method enables rapid, non-damaging, and material-agnostic lab-based quantification of defect density in 2D materials, a crucial step towards the wider adoption of 2D semiconductors in devices.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Simulation and Machine Learning Facilitated Design of Two-Dimensional Nanomaterials-Based Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional transistors based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) are facing significant limitations as device scaling reaches the limits of Moore's Law. These limitations include increased leakage currents, pronounced short-channel effects (SCEs), and quantum tunneling through the gate oxide, leading to higher power consumption and deviations from ideal behavior. Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) can overcome these challenges by utilizing quantum tunneling of charge carriers to switch between on and off states and achieve a subthreshold swing (SS) below 60 mV/decade. This allows for lower power consumption, continued scaling, and improved performance in low-power applications. This review focuses on the design and operation of TFETs, emphasizing the optimization of device performance through material selection and advanced simulation techniques. The discussion will specifically address the use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in TFET design and explore simulation methods ranging from multi-scale (MS) approaches to machine learning (ML)-driven optimization.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a statistical analysis of the performance of a low insulin index, alkaline and functional diet developed by ANTUR evaluated with machine learning techniques is reported. The sample of patients was checked on a regular basis with a BioImpedenziometric (BIA) analysis. The BIA gives about 40 parameters output describing the health status of the patient. The sample of 1626 patients was grouped in clusters with similar characteristics by a neural network algorithm. A study of the behaviour of the BIA parameters evolution over time with respect to the first visit was performed. More than the 75% of the patient that followed the ANTUR diet showed an improvement of the health status.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional heat transfer and melt flow in the laser-impact zone at selective laser melting of thin walls -- II: Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Part II of the present work concerns modeling and analyzing the experimental data obtained in Part I. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of two-dimensional conductive heat transfer and thermocapillary-driven convection is developed. The conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy are numerically solved by a second-order Godunov finite-volume method using an original Riemann solver developed for the applied equation of state. The CFD model is validated by comparison with the experiments. Formation of two outward vortices in the melt pool is revealed. Surface-active impurities can make the surface tension-temperature function non-monotonous giving raise additional vortices with the opposite inward flow direction. The influence of melt convection on the melt pool size is not considerable in the conditions of selective laser melting (SLM). The flow velocity in the melt pool is around or less than the laser scanning speed. This means insufficient mixing in the melt pool. One cannot expect a complete homogenization of chemical composition when using powder blends in SLM. The correlation between the error of the Rosenthal model and the latent heat of fusion is carefully studied resulting an analytical model for estimating the melt pool depth. In the studied SLM cases, the accuracy of the developed analytical model is within 10% relative the CFD model. The obtained experimental and theoretical results indicate that the melt depth is approximately proportional to linear energy density LED in the typical conditions of SLM. This can be useful when optimizing the SLM process.</description>

      <title>Automated Segmentation and Analysis of Microscopy Images of Laser Powder Bed Fusion Melt Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of metal additive manufacturing (AM), researchers and practitioners are turning to data-driven approaches to optimise printing conditions. Cross-sectional images of melt tracks provide valuable information for tuning process parameters, developing parameter scaling data, and identifying defects. Here we present an image segmentation neural network that automatically identifies and measures melt track dimensions from a cross-section image. We use a U-Net architecture to train on a data set of 62 pre-labelled images obtained from different labs, machines, and materials coupled with image augmentation. When neural network hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate are properly tuned, the learned model shows an accuracy for classification of over 99% and an F1 score over 90%. The neural network exhibits robustness when tested on images captured by various users, printed on different machines, and acquired using different microscopes. A post-processing module extracts the height and width of the melt pool, and the wetting angles. We discuss opportunities to improve model performance and avenues for transfer learning, such as extension to other AM processes such as directed energy deposition.</description>

      <title>Influence of bias voltage noise on the Inelastic Cooper-Pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally show that the Inelastic Cooper-Pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA), implementing a DC-powered parametric amplification scheme, can achieve gain and noise performance similar to that of Josephson parametric amplifiers. Using experimental data and simulations, we show that the ICTA has near-quantum-limited noise as long as the integral voltage bias noise divided by the superconducting flux quantum is below the amplification bandwidth. We observe a gain of 20 dB with noise below 1.7 times the quantum limit when the full width at half maximum of the integral voltage noise, expressed as frequency, is 5.6 MHz.</description>

      <title>Windmill droplets. Optical-induced rotation of biphase oil-in-water droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of microdroplet manipulation, optical tweezers have been used to form and grow droplets, move them to specific locations, or to measure forces between droplet pairs. However, the exploration of out-of-equilibrium phenomena in optically trapped droplets remains largely uncharted. Here, we report the rotation of biphasic droplets fabricated by co-emulsifying two immiscible liquids (i.e., hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon oils) with a refractive index mismatch in water. When trapped, droplets of a specific geometry begin to rotate around the axis of the laser beam, in what appears to be a dissipative, out-of-equilibrium phenomenon. The rotational frequency, obtained from image analysis of the rotating droplets, is stable and proportional to the beam power. Remarkably, droplets that do not interact with the trapping beam can also be rotated indirectly. This is achieved by positioning the droplets at the center of a circular arrangement of multiple, sequentially activated traps. In this case, the droplet orients towards the location of the active trap by a mechanism yet to be understood. Altogether, our results demonstrate out-from-equilibrium phenomenology in optically trapped biphase droplets, which could inspire the development of devices based on them (e.g., optically induced mixing, etc.). In addition, they may shed light on fundamental principles of optical manipulation of asymmetric particles.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity of Cubic Silicon Carbide Single Crystals Heavily Doped by Nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-purity cubic silicon carbide possesses the second-highest thermal conductivity among large-scale crystals, surpassed only by diamond, making it crucial for practical applications of thermal management. Recent theoretical studies predict that heavy doping reduces the thermal conductivity of 3C-SiC via phonon-defect and phonon-electron scattering. However, experimental evidence has been limited. In this work, we report the thermal conductivity of heavily nitrogen doped 3C SiC single crystals, grown using the top-seeded solution growth method, measured via time domain thermoreflectance. Our results show that a significant reduction (up to 30%) in thermal conductivity is observed with nitrogen doping concentrations around 1020 cm-3. A comparison with theoretical calculations indicates less intensive scatterings are observed in the measured thermal conductivity. We speculate that the electron-phonon scattering may have a smaller impact than previously anticipated or the distribution of defects are nonuniform which leads to less intensive scatterings. These findings shed light on understanding the doping effects on thermal transport in semiconductors and support further exploration of 3C SiC for thermal management in electronics.</description>

      <title>Electrical Spectroscopy of Polaritonic Nanoresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most captivating properties of polaritons is their capacity to confine light at the nanoscale. This confinement is even more extreme in two-dimensional (2D) materials. 2D polaritons have been investigated by optical measurements using an external photodetector. However, their effective spectrally resolved electrical detection via far-field excitation remains unexplored. This fact hinders their potential exploitation in crucial applications such as sensing molecules and gases, hyperspectral imaging and optical spectrometry, banking on their potential for integration with silicon technologies. Herein, we present the first electrical spectroscopy of polaritonic nanoresonators based on a high-quality 2D-material heterostructure, which serves at the same time as the photodetector and the polaritonic platform. We employ metallic nanorods to create hybrid nanoresonators within the hybrid plasmon-phonon polaritonic medium in the mid and long-wave infrared ranges. Subsequently, we electrically detect these resonators by near-field coupling to a graphene pn-junction. The nanoresonators simultaneously present a record of lateral confinement and high-quality factors of up to 200, exhibiting prominent peaks in the photocurrent spectrum, particularly at the underexplored lower reststrahlen band of hBN. We exploit the geometrical and gate tunability of these nanoresonators to investigate their impact on the photocurrent spectrum and the polaritonic's waveguided modes. This work opens a venue for studying this highly tunable and complex hybrid system, as well as for using it in compact platforms for sensing and photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic and Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effects across Berry-Dipole Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Hopf insulators are a class of topological phases beyond the tenfold-way classification. The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Microscopic Mechanism of Elementary Vortex Pinning in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortex pinning is a crucial factor that determines the critical current of practical superconductors and enables their diverse applications. However, the underlying mechanism of vortex pinning has long been elusive, lacking a clear microscopic explanation. Here using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we studied single vortex pinning induced by point defect in layered FeSe-based superconductors. We found the defect-vortex interaction drives low-energy vortex bound states away from EF, creating a "mini" gap that effectively lowers the system energy and enhances pinning. By measuring the local density-of-states, we directly obtained the elementary pinning energy and estimated the pinning force via the spatial gradient of pinning energy. The results are consistent with bulk critical current measurement. Furthermore, we show that a general microscopic quantum model incorporating defect-vortex interaction can naturally capture our observation. It suggests that the local pairing near pinned vortex core is actually enhanced compared to unpinned vortex, which is beyond the traditional understanding that non-superconducting regions pin vortices. Our study thus unveils a general microscopic mechanism of vortex pinning in superconductors, and provides insights for enhancing the critical current of practical superconductors.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are essential instruments in contemporary nuclear physics research. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo beta+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
