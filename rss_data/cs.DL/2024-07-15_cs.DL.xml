      <title>Distinct citation distributions complicate research evaluations. A single indicator that universally reveals research efficiency cannot be formulated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Analyze the diversity of citation distributions to publications in different research topics to investigate the accuracy of size-independent, rank-based indicators. Top percentile-based indicators are the most common indicators of this type, and the evaluations of Japan are the most evident misjudgments. Design/methodology/approach: The distributions of citations to publications from countries and in journals in several research topics were analyzed along with the corresponding global publications using histograms with logarithmic binning, double rank plots, and normal probability plots of log-transformed numbers of citations. Findings: Size-independent, top percentile-based indicators are accurate when the global ranks of local publications fit a power law, but deviations in the least cited papers are frequent in countries and occur in all journals with high impact factors. In these cases, a single indicator is misleading. Comparisons of proportions of uncited papers are the best way to predict these deviations. Research limitations: The study is fundamentally analytical; its results describe mathematical facts that are self-evident. Practical implications: Respectable institutions, such as the OECD, European Commission, US National Science Board, and others, produce research country rankings and individual evaluations using size-independent percentile indicators that are misleading in many countries. These misleading evaluations should be discontinued because they cause confusion among research policymakers and lead to incorrect research policies. Originality/value: Studies linking the lower tail of citation distribution, including uncited papers, to percentile research indicators have not been performed previously. The present results demonstrate that studies of this type are necessary to find reliable procedures for research assessments.</description>

      <title>Cool URIs for FAIR Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This guide is for everyone who seeks advice for creating stable, secure, and persistent Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in order to publish their data in accordance to the FAIR principles. The use case does not matter. It could range from publishing the results of a small research project to a large knowledge graph at a big corporation. The FAIR principles apply equally and this is why it is important to put extra thought into the URI selection process. The title aims to extend the tradition of "Cool URIs don't change" and "Cool URIs for the Semantic Web". Much has changed since the publication of these works and we would like to revisit some of the principles. Many still hold today, some had to be reworked, and we could also identify new ones</description>

      <title>Structuring Authenticity Assessments on Historical Documents using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the wide use of forgery throughout history, scholars have and are continuously engaged in assessing the authenticity of historical documents. However, online catalogues merely offer descriptive metadata for these documents, relegating discussions about their authenticity to free-text formats, making it difficult to study these assessments at scale. This study explores the generation of structured data about documents' authenticity assessment from natural language texts. Our pipeline exploits Large Language Models (LLMs) to select, extract and classify relevant claims about the topic without the need for training, and Semantic Web technologies to structure and type-validate the LLM's results. The final output is a catalogue of documents whose authenticity has been debated, along with scholars' opinions on their authenticity. This process can serve as a valuable resource for integration into catalogues, allowing room for more intricate queries and analyses on the evolution of these debates over centuries.</description>
