      <title>Considerations for Photochemical Modeling of Possible Hycean Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST is revolutionising the study of temperate sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detection of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. The retrieved abundances of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ and non-detection of NH$_3$ and CO in K2-18 b are consistent with prior predictions of photochemical models for a Hycean world with a habitable ocean. However, recent photochemical modeling raised the prospect that the observed abundances may be explained by a mini-Neptune scenario instead. In this study, we explore these scenarios using independent photochemical modeling with K2-18 b as a case study. We find the previous results to be sensitive to a range of model assumptions, such as the photochemical cross sections, incident stellar spectrum, surface pressure, UV albedo, and metallicity, significantly affecting the resulting abundances. We explore a wide model space to investigate scenarios that are compatible with the retrieved molecular abundances for K2-18 b. Our analysis shows that the previously favoured mini-Neptune scenario is not compatible with most of the retrieved abundances, while the Hycean scenarios, both inhabited and uninhabited, provide better agreement. An uninhabited Hycean scenario explains most of the abundance constraints, except CH$_4$ which is generally underabundant but dependent on the model assumptions. The inhabited Hycean scenario is compatible with all the abundances if the observed CH$_4$ is assumed to be predominantly biogenic. Our results underscore the importance of systematic photochemical modeling and accurate interpretation of chemical abundance constraints for candidate Hycean worlds.</description>

      <title>TIC 393818343 c: Discovery and characterization of a Neptune-like planet in the Delphinus constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the statistical confirmation of a second planet inside the TIC 393818343 system. The first planet TIC 393818343 b has been confirmed and classified as a Warm Jupiter planet with a period of P = (16.24921 +- 0.00003) days. The second planet in the system has an orbital period of P = (7.8458 +- 0.0023) days and orbits 2.05 times closer to its host star. The second planet was initially spotted by the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCOGT) and amateur astronomers. This Super-Neptunian exoplanet marks TIC 393818343 as a multi-planetary system.</description>

      <title>An extremely low-density exoplanet spins slow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on the shape of Kepler-51d, which is a super-puff with a mass $\sim6\,M_\oplus$ and a radius $\sim9\,R_\oplus$, based on detailed modeling of the transit light curve from JWST NIRSpec. The projected shape of this extremely low-density planet is consistent with being spherical, and a projected oblateness $f_\perp&gt;0.2$ can be excluded regardless of the spin obliquity angles. If this is taken as the limit on the true shape of the planet, Kepler-51d is rotating at $\lesssim 50\%$ of its break-up spin rate, or its rotation period is $\gtrsim 33\,$hr. In the more plausible situation that the planetary spin is aligned with its orbital direction to within $30^\circ$, then its oblateness is $&lt;0.08$, which corresponds to a dimensionless spin rate $\lesssim30\%$ of the break-up rotation and a dimensional rotation period $\gtrsim 53\,$hr. This seems to contradict the theoretical expectation that planets with such low masses may be spinning near break-up. We point out the usefulness of the stellar mean density and the orbital eccentricity in constraining the shape of the transiting planet, so planets with well-characterized host and orbital parameters are preferred in the detection of planetary oblateness with the JWST transit method.</description>

      <title>Chapter 10031. Surfaces and Interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last 15 years, since the discovery of the first low-mass planets beyond the solar system, there has been tremendous progress in understanding the diversity of (super-)Earth and sub-Neptune exoplanets. Especially the influence of the planetary interior on the surface evolution (including the atmosphere) of exoplanets has been studied in detail. The first studies focused on the characterization of planets, including their potential interior structure, using as key observables only mass and radius. Meanwhile, a new field of geosciences of exoplanets has emerged, linking the planet to its stellar environment, and by coupling interior chemistry and dynamics to surface regimes and atmospheric compositions. The new era of atmospheric characterization by JWST as well as the ELT will allow testing of these theoretical predictions of atmospheric diversity based on interior structure, evolution, and outgassing models.</description>

      <title>BOWIE-ALIGN: JWST reveals hints of planetesimal accretion and complex sulphur chemistry in the atmosphere of the misaligned hot Jupiter WASP-15b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a transmission spectrum of the misaligned hot Jupiter WASP-15b from 2.8--5.2 microns observed with JWST's NIRSpec/G395H grating. Our high signal to noise data, which has negligible red noise, reveals significant absorption by H$_2$O ($4.2\sigma$) and CO$_2$ ($8.9\sigma$). From independent data reduction and atmospheric retrieval approaches, we infer that WASP-15b's atmospheric metallicity is super-solar ($\gtrsim 15\times$ solar) and its C/O is consistent with solar, that together imply planetesimal accretion. Our GCM simulations for WASP-15b suggest that the C/O we measure at the limb is likely representative of the entire photosphere due to the mostly uniform spatial distribution of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO. We additionally see evidence for absorption by SO$_2$ and absorption at 4.9$\mu$m, for which the current leading candidate is OCS, albeit with several caveats. If confirmed, this would be the first detection of OCS in an exoplanet atmosphere and point towards complex photochemistry of sulphur-bearing species in the upper atmosphere. These are the first observations from the BOWIE-ALIGN survey which is using JWST's NIRSpec/G395H instrument to compare the atmospheric compositions of aligned/low-obliquity and misaligned/high-obliquity hot Jupiters around F stars above the Kraft break. The goal of our survey is to determine whether the atmospheric composition differs across two populations of planets that have likely undergone different migration histories (disc versus disc-free) as evidenced by their obliquities (aligned versus misaligned).</description>

      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: Non-Uniform Dayside Emission for WASP-17b from MIRI/LRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first spectroscopic characterisation of the dayside atmosphere of WASP-17b in the mid-infrared using a single JWST MIRI/LRS eclipse observation. From forward-model fits to the 5-12 $\mu$m emission spectrum, we tightly constrain the heat redistribution factor of WASP-17b to be 0.92$\pm$0.02 at the pressures probed by this data, indicative of inefficient global heat redistribution. We also marginally detect a supersolar abundance of water, consistent with previous findings for WASP-17b, but note our weak constraints on this parameter. These results reflect the thermodynamically rich but chemically poor information content of MIRI/LRS emission data for high-temperature hot Jupiters. Using the eclipse mapping method, which utilises the signals that the spatial emission profile of an exoplanet imprints on the eclipse light curve during ingress/egress due to its partial occultation by the host star, we also construct the first eclipse map of WASP-17b, allowing us to diagnose its multidimensional atmospheric dynamics for the first time. We find a day-night temperature contrast of order 1000 K at the pressures probed by this data, consistent with our derived heat redistribution factor, along with an eastward longitudinal hotspot offset of $18.7^{+11.1\deg}_{-3.8}$, indicative of the presence of an equatorial jet induced by day-night thermal forcing being the dominant redistributor of heat from the substellar point. These dynamics are consistent with general circulation model predictions for WASP-17b. This work is part of a series of studies by the JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).</description>

      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: A Super-Solar Metallicity in WASP-17 b Dayside Atmosphere from NIRISS SOSS Eclipse Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-17 b using one eclipse observation from the JWST Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode. Covering a wavelength range of 0.6 to 2.8 microns, our retrieval analysis reveals a strong detection of H2O in WASP-17b dayside atmosphere (6.4sigma). Our retrievals consistently favor a super-solar dayside H2O abundance and a non-inverted temperature-pressure profile over a large pressure range. Additionally, our examination of the brightness temperature reveals excess emission below 1 microns, suggesting the possibility of a high internal temperature (600 to 700 K) and/or contributions from reflected light. We highlight that JWST emission spectroscopy retrieval results can be sensitive to whether negative eclipse depths are allowed at optical wavelengths during light curve fitting. Our findings deepen our understanding of WASP-17b atmospheric composition while also highlighting the sensitivity of our results to pressure-temperature profile parameterizations. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we will use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).</description>

      <title>The mystery of water in the atmosphere of $\tau$ Bo\"otis b continues: insights from revisiting archival CRIRES observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical abundances of gas-giant exoplanet atmospheres hold clues to the formation and evolution pathways that sculpt the exoplanet population. Recent ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the non-transiting hot Jupiter $\tau$ Bo\"otis b from different instruments have resulted in a tension on the presence of water vapour in the planet's atmosphere, which impact the planet's inferred C/O and metallicity. To investigate this, we revisit the archival CRIRES observations of the planet's dayside in the wavelength range 2.28 to 2.33 $\mu$m. We reanalyse them using the latest methods for correcting stellar and telluric systematics, and free-chemistry Bayesian atmospheric retrieval. We find that a spurious detection of CH$_{4}$ can arise from inadequate telluric correction. We confirm the detection of CO and constrain its abundance to be near solar $\log_{10}(\mathrm{CO})$ = -3.44$^{+1.63}_{-0.85}$ VMR. We find a marginal evidence for H$_{2}$O with $\log_{10}(\mathrm{H_{2}O})$ = -5.13$^{+1.22}_{-6.37}$ VMR. This translates to super solar C/O (0.95$^{+0.06}_{-0.31}$), marginally sub-solar metallicity (-0.21 $^{+1.66}_{-0.87}$). Due to the relatively large uncertainty on H$_{2}$O abundance, we cannot confidently resolve the tension on the presence of H$_{2}$O and the super-solar atmospheric metallicity of $\tau$ Bo\"otis b. We recommend further observations of $\tau$ Bo\"otis b in the wavelength ranges simultaneously covering CO and $\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ to confirm the peculiar case of the planet's super-solar C/O and metallicity.</description>

      <title>Impact of Exoplanet Science on Society: Professional Contributions, Citizen Science Engagement and Public Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of exoplanet science on both the scientific community and on the general public is presented through various indicators and examples. It is estimated that about 3-4% of all refereed astronomy articles focus on exoplanets, and between 15-20% percent of current, and up to 25% of upcoming astronomy space missions are dedicated to exoplanet research. Also, about 15-20% of the science cases for large multi-purpose ground-based astronomical instruments involve exoplanet science.
  Interactions between the scientific community and the public occur on several levels and play a crucial role in shaping the future of exoplanet science. The rise of citizen science platforms and the successes of coordinated observing projects involving amateur astronomers have engaged the public in meaningful scientific contributions, and contribute to some areas of discovery and characterization of exoplanet systems, for which several examples are given. These initiatives not only fuel public interest in the search for extraterrestrial life but also promote STEM education, broadening participation in science.
  Lastly, the changing perception of the informed public about the existence of "other Earths" and life in the Universe in the light of results from exoplanet science is outlined. Media coverage of results from exoplanet science has furthered the acceptance that extraterrestrial life, be it intelligent of not, is not rare in the Universe. The shift in perception that such life might be detected in a potentially not very distant future has, in turn, promoted public support for the research infrastructure necessary to sustain the growth of exoplanetology.</description>

      <title>A regularisation technique to precisely infer limb darkening using transit measurements: can we estimate stellar surface magnetic fields?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-precision measurements of exoplanet transit light curves that are now available contain information about the planet properties, their orbital parameters, and stellar limb darkening (LD). Recent 3D magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of stellar atmospheres have shown that LD depends on the photospheric magnetic field, and hence its precise determination can be used to estimate the field strength. Among existing LD laws, the uses of the simplest ones may lead to biased inferences, whereas the uses of complex laws typically lead to a large degeneracy among the LD parameters. We have developed a novel approach in which we use a complex LD model but with second derivative regularisation during the fitting process. Regularisation controls the complexity of the model appropriately and reduces the degeneracy among LD parameters, thus resulting in precise inferences. The tests on simulated data suggest that our inferences are not only precise but also accurate. This technique is used to re-analyse 43 transit light curves measured by the NASA Kepler and TESS missions. Comparisons of our LD inferences with the corresponding literature values show good agreement, while the precisions of our measurements are better by up to a factor of 2. We find that 1D non-magnetic model atmospheres fail to reproduce the observations while 3D MHD simulations are qualitatively consistent. The LD measurements, together with MHD simulations, confirm that Kepler-17, WASP-18, and KELT-24 have relatively high magnetic fields ($&gt;200$ G). This study paves the way for estimating the stellar surface magnetic field using the LD measurements.</description>

      <title>A Multi-station Meteor Monitoring (M$^3$) System. II. system upgrade and a pathfinder network</title>

Abstract: Meteors are important phenomenon reflecting many properties of interplanetary dust particles. The study of their origin, mass distribution, and orbit evolution all require large data volume, which can only be obtained using large meteor networks. After meteor networks in Europe and America, we present our designs and upgrades of a proposing network in China. The new designs are mainly aimed for facilitating data gathering process. Each of the newly designed meteor stations now can support up to 4 cameras to cover the full sky. Newer version of meteor station software now works as an integral system, which can streamline the process of detecting, measuring and uploading meteors. We have built a meteor data platform to store, process and display the meteor data automatically. The software and data platform are designed to be easy to learn and use, so it can attract more people to join and operate meteor stations. Four stations are installed as the first phase of the network, and during the operation in 10 months, the network detected 8,683 orbits, and we find that half of the orbits can be related to established meteoroid streams. The statistical analysis of sporadic meteoroids shows a bimodal distribution of the velocities, which coincides with previous studies. The distribution of Tisserand parameters, $T_j$, shows the two peaks at $T_j=0$ and 3, indicating the different orbits of parent bodies (isotropic and ecliptic), which are divided by $T_j=2$. The falling trajectory of a meteorite was also predicted using observational data of the network. We are currently expanding the network, and in the future we will carry out detailed analysis of the key parameters of the distribution of the meteoroids.</description>

      <title>Debiasing astro-Photometric Observations with Corrections Using Statistics (DePhOCUS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photometric measurements allow the determination of an asteroid's absolute magnitude, which often represents the sole means to infer its size. Photometric observations can be obtained in a variety of filters that can be unique to a specific observatory. Those observations are then calibrated into specific bands with respect to reference star catalogs. In order to combine all the different measurements for evaluation, photometric observations need to be converted to a common band, typically V-band. Current band-correction schemes in use by IAU's Minor Planet Center, JPL's Center for Near Earth Object Studies and ESA's NEO Coordination Centre use average correction values for the apparent magnitude derived from photometry of asteroids as the corrections are dependent on the typically unknown spectrum of the object to be corrected. By statistically analyzing the photometric residuals of asteroids, we develop a new photometric correction scheme that does not only consider the band, but also accounts for reference catalog and observatory. We describe a new statistical photometry correction scheme for asteroid observations with debiased corrections. Testing this scheme on a reference group of asteroids, we see a 36% reduction in the photometric residuals. Moreover, the new scheme leads to a more accurate and debiased determination of the H-G magnitude system and, in turn, to more reliable inferred sizes. We discuss the significant shift in the corrections with this "DePhOCUS" debiasing system, its limitations, and the impact for photometric and physical properties of all asteroids, especially Near-Earth Objects.</description>

      <title>Making Habitable Worlds: Planets Versus Megastructures</title>

Abstract: In 2016, a star KIC 8462852 caught the world's attention due to a paper by citizen scientists who noticed its seemingly unexplainable brightness variations. The forward theory was offered - KIC 8462852 is surrounded by a Dyson sphere, a megastructure made by an alien civilization to collect all energy output from their star. Finally, in 2018, its light curve showed chromaticity more characteristic of the dust (from comets or asteroids) rather than of something made from solid material, but the world was woken up to the idea of megastructures. But, in Dyson's time, only Solar System planets were known; it took more than 20 years to realize that nature has no problem making planets and does it with a flair -- the total number of planets in the Galaxy is estimated to be in billions. With such abundance of planets, there would be no need to destroy the entire planetary system to make one sphere. Instead, a civilization can expand to a system that has planet(s) in the habitable zone (HZ), or a planet can be moved into it. Alternatively, a free-floating planet (FFP) can be captured and moved into the HZ. These shifts can be performed at a constant low-thrust acceleration using high power directional lasers, resulting in a gradual spiral transfer from one orbit to another. We propose here to search for ETI by looking for high-power laser technosignatures and consider merits of such signatures. We suggest to specifically pay attention to the multiple planetary systems that have Strange Exoplanetary Architectures (SEA) - unusual planetary arrangements that cannot be explained by current planetary formation theories, because these could be the result of ETI moving planets intentionally to suit their needs.</description>

      <title>Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a rotating massive object. Analysis in terms of osculating and nonosculating (contact) elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a rotating massive body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level in terms of the osculating Keplerian orbital elements. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit, and to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.</description>
