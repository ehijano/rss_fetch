      <title>Efficiency in Pure-Exchange Economies with Risk-Averse Monetary Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Pareto efficiency in a pure-exchange economy where agents' preferences are represented by risk-averse monetary utilities. These coincide with law-invariant monetary utilities, and they can be shown to correspond to the class of monotone, (quasi-)concave, Schur concave, and translation-invariant utility functionals. This covers a large class of utility functionals, including a variety of law-invariant robust utilities. We show that Pareto optima exist and are comonotone, and we provide a crisp characterization thereof in the case of law-invariant positively homogeneous monetary utilities. This characterization provides an easily implementable algorithm that fully determines the shape of Pareto-optimal allocations. In the special case of law-invariant comonotone-additive monetary utility functionals (concave Yaari-Dual utilities), we provide a closed-form characterization of Pareto optima. As an application, we examine risk-sharing markets where all agents evaluate risk through law-invariant coherent risk measures, a widely popular class of risk measures. In a numerical illustration, we characterize Pareto-optimal risk-sharing for some special types of coherent risk measures.</description>

      <title>City formation by dual migration of firms and workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a mathematical model of city formation by migration of firms and workers. The Core-Periphery model in the new economic geography, which considers migration of workers driven by real wage inequality among regions, is extended to incorporate migration of firms driven by real profit inequality among regions. Spatially homogeneous distributions of firms and workers become destabilized and eventually forms several cities in which both the firms and workers agglomerate, and the number of the cities decreases as transport costs become lower.</description>

      <title>Robust Design of Persuasion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze many-sender Bayesian persuasion games where receiver can contract their action on senders' choices of Blackwell experiment and realized signals. We characterize robust mechanisms: those that induce the same joint distributions of actions and senders' private types for all possible prior beliefs. These mechanisms take a simple form: they (1) incentivize maximally informative experiments, and (2) depend only on the induced posterior. We prove a grim-trigger-like principle for unilateral deviations, and show robustness is pinned down by a finite set of linear inequalities. We apply our model to allocation problems with either type-dependent outside options or allocation externalities and identify conditions where the efficient outcome is robust. Finally, we uncover a novel justification for deferred acceptance via informational incentives in two-sided matching when school preferences depend on students' unknown ability.</description>
