      <title>Nonthermal driving forces in cells revealed by nonequilibrium fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties within living cells play a critical role in the adaptive regulation of their biological functions upon environmental and internal stimuli. While these properties exhibit nonequilibrium dynamics due to the thermal and nonthermal forces that universally coexist in actin-myosin-active proliferative cells, quantifying them within such complex systems remains challenging. Here, we develop a nonequilibrium framework that combines fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements of intracellular diffusion with nonequilibrium theory to quantitatively analyze cell-specific nonthermal driving forces and cellular adaptability. Our results reveal that intracellular particle diffusion is influenced not only by common thermal forces but also by nonthermal forces generated by approximately 10-100 motor proteins. Furthermore, we derive a physical parameter that quantitatively assesses the sensitivity of intracellular particle responses to these nonthermal forces, showing that systems with more active diffusion exhibit higher response sensitivity. Our work highlights the biological fluctuations arising from multiple interacting elements, advancing the understanding of the complex mechanical properties within living cells.</description>

      <title>Dwellers in the Deep: Biological Consequences of Dark Oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The striking recent putative detection of "dark oxygen" (dark O$_2$) sources on the abyssal ocean floor in the Pacific at $\sim 4$ km depth raises the intriguing scenario that complex (i.e., animal-like) life could exist in underwater environments sans oxygenic photosynthesis. In this work, we thus explore the possible (astro)biological implications of this discovery. From the available data, we roughly estimate the concentration of dissolved O$_2$ and the corresponding O$_2$ partial pressure, as well as the flux of O$_2$ production, associated with dark oxygen sources. Based on these values, we infer that organisms limited by internal diffusion may reach maximal sizes of $\sim 0.1-1$ mm in habitats with dark O$_2$, while those with circulatory systems might achieve sizes of $\sim 0.1-10$ cm. Optimistically, the estimated dark oxygen flux can potentially support biomass densities up to $\sim 3-30$ g m$^{-2}$, perhaps surpassing typical reported densities at similar depths in global deep-sea surveys. Finally, we outline how oceanic settings with dark O$_2$ may facilitate the origin(s) of life via the emergence of electrotrophy. Our findings indicate that complex life fueled by dark oxygen is plausibly capable of inhabiting submarine environments devoid of photosynthesis on Earth, conceivably extending likewise to extraterrestrial locations such as icy worlds with subsurface oceans (e.g., Enceladus and Europa), which are likely common throughout the Universe.</description>

      <title>On Networks and their Applications: Stability of Gene Regulatory Networks and Gene Function Prediction using Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that nested canalizing functions are the minimum-sensitivity Boolean functions for any activity ratio and we determine the functional form of this boundary which has a nontrivial fractal structure. We further observe that the majority of the gene regulatory functions found in known biological networks (submitted to the Cell Collective database) lie on the line of minimum sensitivity which paradoxically remains largely in the unstable regime. Our results provide a quantitative basis for the argument that an evolutionary preference for nested canalizing functions in gene regulation (e.g., for higher robustness) and for elasticity of gene activity are sufficient for concentration of such systems near the "edge of chaos." The original structure of gene regulatory networks is unknown due to the undiscovered functions of some genes. Most gene function discovery approaches make use of unsupervised clustering or classification methods that discover and exploit patterns in gene expression profiles. However, existing knowledge in the field derives from multiple and diverse sources. Incorporating this know-how for novel gene function prediction can, therefore, be expected to improve such predictions. We here propose a function-specific novel gene discovery tool that uses a semi-supervised autoencoder. Our method is thus able to address the needs of a modern researcher whose expertise is typically confined to a specific functional domain. Lastly, the dynamics of unorthodox learning approaches like biologically plausible learning algorithms are investigated and found to exhibit a general form of Einstein relation.</description>

      <title>Effective and efficient modeling of the hydrodynamics for bacterial flagella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions between bacterial flagella and surrounding boundaries are important for bacterial motility and gait in complex environment. By modeling each flagellar filament that is both thin and long as a string of spheres, we show that such hydrodynamic interactions can be accurately described through a resistance tensor, which can be efficiently evaluated numerically. For the case of close interaction between one bacterium and one passive colloidal sphere, we see notable difference between results from our model and those from the resistive force theory, showing that the error arises from negligence of the width of flagellar filaments in resistive force theory can be strong.</description>
