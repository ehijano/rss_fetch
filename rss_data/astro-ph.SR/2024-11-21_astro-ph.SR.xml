      <title>Temporal Changes in the Infrared Spectra of Magellanic Carbon Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer on the Mid-Infrared Instrument on JWST obtained spectra of three carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Two of the spectra differ significantly from spectra obtained ~16-19 years earlier with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The one semi-regular variable among the three has changed little. The long-period Mira variable in the sample shows changes consistent with its pulsation cycle. The short-period Mira shows dramatic changes in the strength of its molecular absorption bands, with some bands growing weaker and some stronger. Whether these variations result from its pulsation cycle or its evolution is not clear.</description>

      <title>Empirical color correction to MIST and PARSEC isochrones on Gaia BR-RP and G-RP with benchmark open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent literature reports a color deviation between observed Gaia color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and theoretical model isochrone predictions, particularly in the very low-mass regime. To assess its impact on cluster age determination via isochrone fitting, we quantified the color deviations for three benchmark clusters, Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe, both for the Gaia color (BP-RP) and (G-RP). In general, the (G-RP) color deviations are smaller than the (BP-RP) ones. Empirical color correction functions based on these benchmarks are derived for the currently available MIST and PARSEC 1.2S isochrone models. Applying the correction functions to 31 additional open clusters and 3 moving groups results in a significantly improved alignment between the isochrones and observed CMDs. With our empirical corrections, isochrones provide age estimates consistent with literature values obtained through the spectral Lithium Depletion Boundary method, validating the effectiveness of our approach. The corresponding metallicities with PARSEC 1.2S also show a good agreement with the spectroscopic results. The empirical color correction function we present in this work offers a tool for a consistent age determination within the full mass range of stellar clusters using the isochrone fitting method.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the activity-rotation relation for evolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic dynamo mechanism of giant stars remains an open question, which can be explored by investigating their activity-rotation relations with multiple proxies. By using the data from the LAMOST and \emph{GALEX} surveys, we carried out a comprehensive study of activity-rotation relations of evolved stars based on \cahk lines, $\rm{H\alpha}$ lines and near ultraviolet (NUV) emissions. Our results show that evolved stars and dwarfs obey a similar power-law in the unsaturated region of the activity-rotation relation, indicating a common dynamo mechanism in both giant and dwarfs. There is no clear difference in the activity levels between red giant branch stars and red clump stars, nor between single giants and those in binaries. Additionally, our results show that the NUV activity levels of giants are comparable to those of G- and K-type dwarfs and are higher than those of M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>EWOCS-III: JWST observations of the supermassive star cluster Westerlund 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The typically large distances, extinction, and crowding of Galactic supermassive star clusters have so far hampered the identification of their very low mass members, required to extend our understanding of star and planet formation, and early stellar evolution, to starburst. This situation has now evolved thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and its unmatched resolution and sensitivity in the infrared. In this paper, the third of the series of the Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey (EWOCS), we present JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI observations of the supermassive star cluster Westerlund 1. These observations are specifically designed to unveil the cluster members down to the BD mass regime, and to allow us to select and study the protoplanetary disks and to study the mutual feedback between the cluster members and the surrounding environment. Westerlund 1 was observed as part of JWST GO-1905 for 23.6 hours. The data have been reduced using the JWST calibration pipeline, together with specific tools necessary to remove artifacts. Source identification and photometry were performed with DOLPHOT. The MIRI images show a plethora of different features. Diffuse nebular emission is observed around the cluster, which is typically composed of myriads of droplet-like features pointing toward the cluster center or the group of massive stars surrounding the WR star W72/A. A long pillar is also observed in the NW. The MIRI images also show resolved shells and outflows surrounding the M-type RSG W20, W26, W75, and W237, the sgB[e] star W9 and the YHG W4. The color-magnitude diagrams built using the NIRCam photometry show a clear cluster sequence, which is marked in its upper part by the 1828 NIRCam stars with X-ray counterparts. NIRCam observations using the F115W filter have reached the 23.8 mag limit with 50\% completeness (roughly corresponding to a 0.06 Msol brown dwarf).</description>

      <title>Measurement of interstellar extinction for classical T Tauri stars using far-UV H2 line fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interstellar and potentially circumstellar extinction in the sight lines of classical T Tauri stars is an important ingredient for constructing reliable spectral energy distributions, which catalyze protoplanetary disk chemistry, for example. Therefore, some attempts of measuring $A_{V}$ toward individual stars have been made using partly different wavelength regimes and different underlying assumptions. We used strong lines of Ly{\alpha} fluorescent H2 and derived the extinction based on the assumption of optically thin transitions. We investigated a sample of 72 classical T Tauri stars observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in the framework of the ULLYSES program. We computed $A_{V}$ and $R_{V}$ values for the 34 objects with sufficient data quality and an additionally $A_{V}$ value for the canonical $R_{V}$ = 3.1 value. Our results agree largely with values obtained from optical data. Moreover, we confirm the degeneracy between $A_{V}$ and $R_{V}$ and present possibilities to break this. Finally, we discuss whether the assumption of optical thin lines is valid.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach to estimate mid-infrared fluxes from WISE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While WISE is the largest, best quality infrared all-sky survey to date, a smaller coverage mission, Spitzer, was designed to have better sensitivity and spatial resolution at similar wavelengths. Confusion and contamination in WISE data result in discrepancies between them. We present a novel approach to work with WISE measurements with the goal of maintaining both its high coverage and vast amount of data while taking full advantage of the higher sensitivity and spatial resolution of Spitzer. We have applied machine learning (ML) techniques to a complete WISE data sample of open cluster members, using a training set of paired data from high-quality Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP), MIPS and IRAC, and allWISE catalogs, W1 (3.4 {\mu}m) to W4 (22 {\mu}m) bands. We have tested several ML regression models with the aim of predicting mid-infrared fluxes at MIPS1 (24 {\mu}m) and IRAC4 (8 {\mu}m) bands from WISE fluxes and quality flags. In addition, to improve the prediction quality, we have implemented feature selection techniques to remove irrelevant WISE variables. We have notably enhanced WISE detection capabilities, mostly at lowest magnitudes, which previously showed the largest discrepancies with Spitzer. In our particular case, extremely randomized trees was found to be the best algorithm to predict mid-infrared fluxes from WISE variables. We have tested our results in the SED of members of IC 348. We show discrepancies in the measurements of Spitzer and WISE and demonstrate the good concordance of our predicted fluxes with the real ones. ML is a fast and powerful tool that can be used to find hidden relationships between datasets, as the ones that exist between WISE and Spitzer fluxes. We believe this approach could be employed for other samples from the allWISE catalog with SEIP positional counterparts, and in other astrophysical studies with analogous discrepancies.</description>

      <title>The evolutionary state of the red giant star L$_2$ Puppis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: L$_2$ Puppis (L$_2$ Pup) is a nearby red giant star and an important object in late-type star research because it has a dust disc and potentially a companion. Aims: L$_2$ Pup is often called the second-closest Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star to the sun, second only to R Doradus. However, whether the star is indeed on the AGB or the Red Giant Branch (RGB) is questionable. We review its evolutionary state. Methods: We analyse high-resolution optical archive spectra to search for absorption lines of the third dredge-up indicator technetium (Tc) in L$_2$~Pup. We also compare the star to a sample of well-known AGB stars in terms of luminosity and pulsation properties and place it in a Gaia-2MASS diagram. Results: L$_2$ Pup is found to be Tc-poor. Thus, it is not undergoing third dredge-up events. The star is fainter than the RGB tip and fainter than all Tc-rich stars in the comparison sample. L$_2$ Pup pulsates in the fundamental mode, similar to Mira variables, but its pulsation properties do not allow us to distinguish between the RGB and AGB stages. Conclusions: In conclusion, L$_2$ Pup could be an RGB or early AGB star, but it is more likely to be an RGB than an AGB star. Our findings are important for a better understanding of the L$_2$ Pup system and its past and future evolution</description>

      <title>Accreting Binary Eccentricities follow Predicted Equilibrium Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate observations of circumbinary disks (CBD), to find evidence for an equilibrium eccentricity predicted by current binary accretion theory. Although stellar binary demographics in the Milky Way show no evidence for a preferred eccentricity for binary systems, we show that actively accreting systems lie on a predicted equilibrium eccentricity curve. We constrain our sample to only systems that have well defined orbital parameters (e.g,. eccentricity, mass-ratio, inclination angle). We find observations are consistent with theory for stellar binaries that are aligned with the disk and that are separated enough that tidal circularization is negligible. This suggests that eccentricity in these systems evolves after the dissipation of the CBD, given the flat eccentricity distribution of binary systems in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mission Observations of Relativistic Electrons and High-Speed Jets Linked to Shock Generated Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock-generated transients, such as hot flow anomalies (HFAs), upstream of planetary bow shocks, play a critical role in electron acceleration. Using multi-mission data from NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and ESA's Cluster missions, we demonstrate the transmission of HFAs through Earth's quasi-parallel bow shock, associated with acceleration of electrons up to relativistic energies. Energetic electrons, initially accelerated upstream, are shown to remain broadly confined within the transmitted transient structures downstream, where betatron acceleration further boosts their energy due to elevated compression levels. Additionally, high-speed jets form at the compressive edges of HFAs, exhibiting a significant increase in dynamic pressure and potentially contributing to driving further localized compression. Our findings emphasize the efficiency of quasi-parallel shocks in driving particle acceleration far beyond the immediate shock transition region, expanding the acceleration region to a larger spatial domain. Finally, this study underscores the importance of multi-scale observational approach in understanding the convoluted processes behind collisionless shock physics and their broader implications.</description>

      <title>Streams and Bubbles: Tidal Shaping of Planetary Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets lose mass to atmospheric outflows, and this mass loss is thought to be central in shaping the bimodal population of gaseous giant and rocky terrestrial exoplanets in close orbits. We model the escape of planetary atmospheres in three dimensional gas dynamic simulations in order to study their emergent morphology. Planetary outflows show a range of shapes from fast, isotropic outflows bounded by bow shocks to slower motion confined to thin streams. We show that a crucial factor is the role of the tidal gravity and orbiting reference frame in which planets lose mass. Flows can be characterized by the dimensionless Rossby number evaluated at the scale of the Hill sphere. Flows with a low Rossby number are significantly deviated and shaped by the stellar gravity, while those with a high Rossby number are comparatively unaffected. Rossby number alone is sufficient to predict outflow morphology as well as kinematic gradients across transit. The known exoplanet population should span a range of outflow Rossby numbers and thus shapes. We can use this information to constrain outflow physics and to inform observing strategies.</description>

      <title>Modelling carbon chain and complex organic molecules in the DR21(OH) clump</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star-forming regions host a large and evolving suite of molecular species. Molecular transition lines, particularly of complex molecules, can reveal the physical and dynamical environment of star formation. We aim to study the large-scale structure and environment of high-mass star formation through single-dish observations of CH$_3$CCH, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO. We have conducted a wide-band spectral survey with the IRAM 30-m telescope and the 100-m GBT towards the high-mass star-forming region DR21(OH)/N44. We use a multi-component local thermodynamic equilibrium model to determine the large-scale physical environment near DR21(OH) and the surrounding dense clumps. We follow up with a radiative transfer code for CH$_3$OH to look at non-LTE behaviour. We then use a gas-grain chemical model to understand the formation routes of these molecules in their observed environments. We disentangle multiple components of DR21(OH) in each of the three molecules. We find a warm and cold component each towards the dusty condensations MM1 and MM2, and a fifth broad, outflow component. We also reveal warm and cold components towards other dense clumps in our maps: N40, N36, N41, N38, and N48. We find thermal mechanisms are adequate to produce the observed abundances of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$CCH while non-thermal mechanisms are needed to produce CH$_3$OH. Through a combination of wide-band mapping observations, LTE and non-LTE model analysis, and chemical modelling, we disentangle the different velocity and temperature components within our clump-scale beam, a scale that links a star-forming core to its parent cloud. We find numerous warm, 20-80 K components corresponding to known cores and outflows in the region. We determine the production routes of these species to be dominated by grain chemistry.</description>

      <title>The temporal and spatial variations of lithium abundance in the Galactic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the temporal and spatial variations in lithium abundance within the Milky Way using a sample of 22,034 main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) stars and subgiants, characterised by precise stellar ages, 3D NLTE (non-local thermodynamic equilibrium) lithium abundances, and birth radii. Our results reveal a complex variation in lithium abundance with stellar age: a gradual increase from 14 Gyr to 6 Gyr, followed by a decline between 6 Gyr and 4.5 Gyr, and a rapid increase thereafter. We find that young Li-rich stars (ages $&lt;$ 4 Gyr, A(Li) $&gt;$ 2.7 dex) predominantly originate from the outer disc. By binning the sample according to guiding center radius and z$_{\rm max}$, we observe that these young Li-rich stars migrate radially to the local and inner discs. In addition, the stars originating from the inner disc experienced a rapid Li enrichment process between 8 Gyr and 6 Gyr. Our analysis suggests that the age range of Li-dip stars is 4-5 Gyr, encompassing evolution stages from MSTO stars to subgiants. The Galactic radial profile of A(Li) (with respect to birth radius), as a function of age, reveals three distinct periods: 14-6 Gyr ago, 6-4 Gyr ago, and 4-1 Gyr ago. Initially, the lithium abundance gradient is positive, indicating increasing Li abundance with birth radius. During the second period, it transitions to a negative and broken gradient, mainly affected by Li-dip stars. In the final period, the gradient reverts to a positive trend.</description>

Abstract: The disk mass and substructure in young stellar objects suggest that planet formation may start at the protostellar stage through the growth of dust grains. To accurately estimate the grain size at the protostellar stage, we have observed the Class I protostar TMC-1A using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at the Q (7 mm) and Ka (9 mm) bands at a resolution of ~0.2" and analyzed archival data of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) and 7 (0.9 mm) that cover the same spatial scale. The VLA images show a compact structure with a size of ~25 au and a spectral index of ~2.5. The ALMA images show compact and extended structures with a spectral index of ~2 at the central ~40 au region and another index of ~3.3 in the outer region. Our SED analysis using the observed fluxes at the four bands suggests one branch with a small grain size of ~0.12 mm and another with a grown grain size of ~4 mm. We also model polarized dust continuum emission adopting the two grain sizes and compare them with an observational result of TMC-1A, suggesting that the small grain size is preferable to the grown grain size. The small grain size implies gravitational instability in the TMC-1A disk, which is consistent with a spiral-like component recently identified.</description>

      <title>Validity of Brink Axel Hypothesis for calculations of allowed stellar weak rates of heavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The knowledge of beta decay transitional probabilities and GamowTeller (GT) strength functions from highly excited states of nuclides is of particular importance for applications to astrophysical network calculations of nucleosynthesis in explosive stellar events. These quantities are challenging to achieve from measurements or computations using various nuclear models. Due to unavailability of feasible alternatives, many theoretical studies often rely on the Brink Axel (BA) hypothesis, that is, the response of strength functions depends merely on the transition energy of the parent nuclear ground state and is independent of the underlying details of the parent state, for the calculation of stellar rates. BA hypothesis has been used in many applications from nuclear structure determination to nucleosynthesis yield in the astrophysical matter.</description>

      <title>Production and Loss Processes of Hydrogen Energetic Neutral Atoms in the Heliosphere from 5 eV to 500 keV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) observations provide valuable insights into the plasma conditions in the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium. Unlike plasma detectors, which measure charged particles tied to the magnetic fields at their location, ENA detectors capture former ions that were neutralized in distant regions and traverse the heliosphere in straight trajectories. ENA fluxes near the Sun represent line-of-sight integrals of parent ion fluxes multiplied by neutralization (production) rates and reduced by the probability of ENA reionization (loss) processes. So far, most ENA analyses have focused on charge exchange between hydrogen atoms and protons as the primary source of ENAs. Here, we examine various ENA production and loss processes throughout the heliosphere in the broad energy range (5 eV to 500 keV) encompassing the next-generation ENA instruments aboard the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission. Our study considers binary collisions involving the most abundant species: protons, electrons, {\alpha}-particles, He+ ions, photons, as well as hydrogen and helium atoms. Our findings indicate that, in addition to ENAs produced by charge exchange of energetic protons with hydrogen atoms, a significant portion of high-energy ENAs originate from the charge exchange with helium atoms. Below 10 keV, the dominant ENA loss processes are charge exchange collisions with protons and photoionization. However, stripping ionization processes, e.g., from collisions with ambient interstellar neutral hydrogen, become the main loss mechanism for higher energies because the charge exchange rate rapidly decreases.</description>

      <title>Database Design for SpExoDisks: A Database &amp; Web Portal for Spectra of Exoplanet-Forming Disks</title>

Abstract: Data access -- or the availability of new and archival data for use by the larger community -- is key for scientific advancement. How data is presented, searched, and formatted determines accessibility and it can be difficult to find a solution that fits the needs of a given subdiscipline. We present a generalized roadmap for developing a specialty astronomy database with web application based on the development of the SpExoDisks (Spectra of Exoplanet forming Disks) database (spexodisks.com), which provides infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks. Expertise in an astronomy subdiscipline can provide two necessary components for creating a database: access to a large volume of specialized data and knowledge of how that data should be presented to the community. However, there are a variety of steps and decisions for database development that can fall outside astronomy expertise. Here we offer generalized discussions on design and process that are accompanied by real-world examples from the SpExoDisks developer team and website. Starting from the database portal design and data organization, we demonstrate on-demand data distribution and query using publicly accessible database software. These systems support interactive visualizations such that users can explore spectra directly from their browsers. We also offer details that show how the technical concepts in SpExoDisks are implemented, particularly emphasizing sustainability and long-term management of the codebase and processes. Finally, we illustrate the utility that a specialty website can offer to the community by providing a specific example of how the combined spectra from SpExoDisks can enhance our understanding of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Small and Close-In Planets are Uncommon around A-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kepler and K2 missions enabled robust calculations of planet occurrence rates around FGKM-type stars. However, these missions observed too few stars with earlier spectral types to tightly constrain the occurrence rates of planets orbiting hotter stars. Using TESS, we calculate the occurrence rate of small ($1 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 8 \, R_\oplus$), close-in ($P_{\rm orb} &lt; 10$~days) planets orbiting A-type stars for the first time. We search a sample of 20,257 bright ($6 &lt; T &lt; 10$) A-type stars for transiting planets using a custom pipeline and vet the detected signals, finding no reliable small planets. We characterize the pipeline completeness using injection/recovery tests and determine the $3\sigma$ upper limits of the occurrence rates of close-in sub-Saturns ($4 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 8 \, R_\oplus$), sub-Neptunes ($2 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 4 \, R_\oplus$), and super-Earths ($1 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 2 \, R_\oplus$). We find upper limits of $2.2 \pm 0.4$ sub-Saturns and $9.1 \pm 1.8$ sub-Neptunes per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than $3\times$ and $6\times$ lower than \textit{Kepler}-era estimates for Sun-like stars. We calculate an upper limit of $186 \pm 34$ super-Earths per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than $1.5\times$ lower than that for M dwarfs. Our results hint that small, close-in planets become rarer around early-type stars and that their occurrence rates decrease faster than that of hot Jupiters with increasing host star temperature. We discuss plausible explanations for these trends, including star-disk interactions and enhanced photoevaporation of planet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Assessing the processes behind planet engulfment and its imprints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout a planetary system's formation evolution, some of the planetary material may end up falling into the host star and be engulfed by it, leading to a potential variation of the stellar composition. The present study explores how planet engulfment may impact the chemical composition of the stellar surface and discusses what would be the rate of events with an observable imprint, for Sun-like stars. We use data from the NGPPS calculations by the Generation III Bern model to analyse the conditions under which planet engulfment may occur. Additionally, we use stellar models computed with Cesam2k20 to account for how the stellar internal structure and its processes may affect the dilution of the signal caused by planet engulfment. Our results show that there are three different phases associated to different mechanisms under which engulfment events may happen. Moreover, systems that undergo planet engulfment are more likely to come from protoplanetary disks that are more massive and more metal-rich than non-engulfing systems. Engulfment events leading to an observable signal happen after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the convective envelope of the stars becomes thinner. With the stellar convective layer shrinking as the star evolves in the main sequence, they display a higher variation of chemical composition, which also correlates with the amount of engulfed material. By accounting for the physical processes happening in the stellar interior and in the optimistic case of being able to detect variations above 0.02 dex in the stellar composition, we find an engulfment rate no higher than $20\%$ for Sun-like stars that may reveal detectable traces of planet engulfment. Engulfment events that lead to an observable variation of the stellar composition are rare due to the specific conditions required to result in such signatures.</description>

      <title>Extreme heating of minor ions in imbalanced solar-wind turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minor ions in the solar corona are heated to extreme temperatures, far in excess of those of the electrons and protons that comprise the bulk of the plasma. These highly non-thermal distributions make minor ions sensitive probes of the underlying collisionless heating processes, which are crucial to coronal heating and the creation of the solar wind. The recent discovery of the "helicity barrier" offers a mechanism where imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in low-beta plasmas preferentially heats protons over electrons, generating high-frequency, proton-cyclotron-resonant fluctuations. We use the hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell code, Pegasus++, to drive imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in a 3D low-beta plasma with additional passive ion species, He$^{2+}$ and O$^{5+}$. A helicity barrier naturally develops, followed by clear phase-space signatures of oblique ion-cyclotron-wave heating and Landau-resonant heating from the imbalanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations. The former results in characteristically arced ion velocity distribution functions, whose non-bi-Maxwellian features are shown by linear ALPS calculations to be critical to the heating process. Additional features include a steep transition-range electromagnetic spectrum, the presence of ion-cyclotron waves propagating in the direction of imbalance, significantly enhanced proton-to-electron heating ratios, anisotropic ion temperatures that are significantly more perpendicular with respect to magnetic field, and extreme heating of heavier species in a manner consistent with empirically derived mass scalings informed by measurements. None of these features are realized in an otherwise equivalent simulation of balanced turbulence. If seen simultaneously in the fast solar wind, these signatures of the helicity barrier would testify to the necessity of incorporating turbulence imbalance in a complete theory for the evolution of the solar wind.</description>

Abstract: Studying the magnetic field properties on the solar surface is crucial for understanding the solar and heliospheric activities, which in turn shape space weather in the solar system. Surface Flux Transport (SFT) modeling helps us to simulate and analyse the transport and evolution of magnetic flux on the solar surface, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms responsible for solar activity. In this work, we demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques in solving magnetic flux transport, making it accurate. We have developed a novel Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)-based model to study the evolution of Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) using SFT in one-dimensional azimuthally averaged and also in two-dimensions. We demonstrate the efficiency and computational feasibility of our PINN-based model by comparing its performance and accuracy with that of a numerical model implemented using the Runge-Kutta Implicit-Explicit (RK-IMEX) scheme. The mesh-independent PINN method can be used to reproduce the observed polar magnetic field with better flux conservation. This advancement is important for accurately reproducing observed polar magnetic fields, thereby providing insights into the strength of future solar cycles. This work paves the way for more efficient and accurate simulations of solar magnetic flux transport and showcases the applicability of PINN in solving advection-diffusion equations with a particular focus on heliophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral classification is the division of stars into classes based on their spectral characteristics. Different classification systems have existed since the 19th century but the term is used nowadays mostly to refer to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system, which was established in the 1940s and has been developed since then. The MK classification has three components: a spectral type, a luminosity class, and (possibly) suffixes or qualifiers. The first two components represent temperature and luminosity sequences (a 2-D grid), respectively, and the third one includes additional information. The MK system is an Aristotelian morphological classification system that uses the MK process, an inductive approach based on specimens (standard stars) that define the system. In that respect, it is different from and a required preliminary step for quantitative spectroscopy, whose goal is to extract the physical properties and chemical composition of the stars. In this entry we provide a brief history of spectral classification, describe the general properties of the classification criteria of the MK system, analyze the specific spectral type and luminosity class criteria used for each spectral class, and introduce the different peculiar types that can be found within the 2-D classification grid and at its edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars are unique main-sequence stars that appear more luminous, hotter, and therefore younger, than their coeval counterparts. In star clusters, these stars are located above the cluster turn-off in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram or color-magnitude diagram. First identified in the 1950s, these stars are found across diverse environments, from sparse galactic fields to dense star clusters. They are crucial for understanding stellar and binary evolution and star cluster dynamics. Despite extensive research, many challenges concerning their properties and origin mechanisms remain unresolved. This chapter delves into the properties and origins of blue stragglers, examining how theoretical tools are employed to study them and the implications of each proposed formation mechanism. We assess how contemporary observational data either support or challenge these theoretical predictions. Continued theoretical and observational efforts are essential for advancing our understanding of these enigmatic stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the unplanned detection of a white dwarf companion to the star HD 218261 in mid-infrared (10-16 $\mu$m) observations with JWST/MIRI. This star was observed as a calibrator for coronagraphic observations of the exoplanet host HR 8799. HD 218261 B has only previously been detected by Gaia, and only in visible light. We confidently detect the companion in the mid-infrared, where it is less luminous than the primary by a factor of ~10$^4$. The visible and mid-infrared photometry are consistent with a white dwarf of $T_\text{eff}\approx10000$ K, $M\approx0.8 M_\odot$, though observation of its optical spectrum is required to precisely constrain its physical parameters. These results demonstrate that precise mid-infrared photometry of white dwarf companions to bright stars can be obtained with MIRI, opening up new possibilities for studying white dwarfs in close binaries.</description>

      <title>Photometric detection of internal gravity waves in upper main-sequence stars. IV. Comparable stochastic low-frequency variability in SMC, LMC, and Galactic massive stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive main-sequence stars have convective cores and radiative envelopes, but also sub-surface convection zones caused by partial ionisation. However, the convective properties depend on opacity and a star's metallicity. Non-rotating 1D evolution models of main-sequence stars with the metallicity of the SMC suggest tenuous sub-surface convection zones using the Rayleigh number as a criterion for convection owing to their lower metallicity. We test whether massive stars of different metallicities both inside and outside of asteroseismically calibrated stability windows for sub-surface convection exhibit different properties in stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability. We extracted customised light curves from the TESS mission for a sample of massive stars using an effective point spread function (ePSF) method, and compared their morphologies in terms of characteristic frequency and amplitude using a Gaussian process (GP) regression methodology. We demonstrate that the properties of SLF variability are generally consistent across the metallicity range from the Milky Way down to the SMC, for stars both inside and outside of the sub-surface stability windows. We conclude that non-rotating 1D stellar structure models cannot alone be used to explain SLF variability in light curves of massive stars. The similar properties of SLF variability across a range of metallicity values, which follow the same trends in mass and age in the HR diagram at both high and low metallicity, support a transition in the dominant mechanism causing SLF variability from younger to more evolved stars. Specifically, core-excited internal gravity waves (IGWs) are favoured for younger stars lacking sub-surface convection zones, especially at low metallicity, and sub-surface convection zones are favoured for more evolved massive stars.

      <title>Detection of the lowest mass ratio contact binary in the universe: TYC 3801-1529-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first analysis of the contact binary TYC 3801-1529-1. We observed four sets of multiple bands complete light curves and one set of radial velocity curve of the primary component. Based on a simultaneous investigation of our observed and TESS light curves and the radial velocity curve, we found that TYC 3801-1529-1 is an extremely low-mass-ratio, medium contact binary with $q=0.0356$, with the contribution of the third light at a level of about 10\%. Its mass ratio is lower than V1187 Her, making TYC 3801-1529-1 the lowest mass-ratio contact binary ever found in the universe. The light curves observed in 2022 are asymmetric, which is aptly explained by a hot spot on the primary component. A 16-year eclipse timings analysis indicates a secular increase orbital period with a rate of dp/dt$=7.96(\pm0.35)\times10^{-7}$ d yr$^{-1}$. We studied the stability of this target and identified that not only the value of $J_{spin}/J_{orb}$, but also the mass ratio surpass the unstable boundary. Hence, TYC 3801-1529-1 presents a challenge to theoretical research and ought to be considered a progenitor of a contact binary merger.</description>

Abstract: Planetesimal formation via the streaming and gravitational instabilities of dust in protoplanetary disks requires a local enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is a plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However, recent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust grains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution models that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more strongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously anticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that enables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly drifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly drifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the timescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial advection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for the transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion structure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and radial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations confirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when the predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by MHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal formation from poorly sticky grains.</description>

      <title>Modeling protoplanetary disk heating by planet-induced spiral shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the heating of protoplanetary disks caused by shocks associated with spiral density waves induced by an embedded planet. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the dependence of shock heating rates on various disk and planetary parameters. Our results show that the shock heating rates are primarily influenced by the planet's mass and the disk's viscosity, while being insensitive to the thermal relaxation rate and the radial profiles of the disk's surface density and sound speed. We provide universal empirical formulas for the shock heating rates produced by the primary and secondary spiral arms as a function of orbital radius, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and planet-to-star mass ratio $q$. The obtained formulas are accurate within a factor of a few for a moderately viscous and adiabatic disk with a planet massive enough that its spiral arms are strongly nonlinear. Using these universal relations, we show that shock heating can overwhelm viscous heating when the disk viscosity is low ($\alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$) and the planet is massive ($q \gtrsim 10^{-3}$). Our empirical relations for the shock heating rates are simple and can be easily implemented into radially one-dimensional models of gas and dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.</description>
