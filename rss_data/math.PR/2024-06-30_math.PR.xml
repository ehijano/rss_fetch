      <title>Convergence, optimization and stability of singular eigenmaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenmaps are important in analysis, geometry, and machine learning, especially in nonlinear dimension reduction. Approximation of the eigenmaps of a Laplace operator depends crucially on the scaling parameter $\epsilon$. If $\epsilon$ is too small or too large, then the approximation is inaccurate or completely breaks down. However, an analytic expression for the optimal $\epsilon$ is out of reach. In our work, we use some explicitly solvable models and Monte Carlo simulations to find the approximately optimal range of $\epsilon$ that gives, on average, relatively accurate approximation of the eigenmaps. Numerically we can consider several model situations where eigen-coordinates can be computed analytically, including intervals with uniform and weighted measures, squares, tori, spheres, and the Sierpinski gasket. In broader terms, we intend to study eigen-coordinates on weighted Riemannian manifolds, possibly with boundary, and on some metric measure spaces, such as fractals.</description>

      <title>Quasi-limiting behaviour of the sub-critical Multitype Bisexual Galton-Watson Branching Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasi-limiting behaviour of bisexual subcritical Galton-Watson branching processes. While classical subcritical Galton-Watson processes have been extensively analyzed, bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes present unique difficulties because of the lack of the branching property. To prove the existence of and convergence to one or several quasi-stationary distributions, we leverage on recent developments linking bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes extinction to the eigenvalue of a concave operator.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic View on the Adapted Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal optimal transport and adapted Wasserstein distance have applications in different fields from optimization to mathematical finance and machine learning. The goal of this article is to provide equivalent formulations of these concepts in classic probabilistic language. In particular, we prove a Skorokhod representation theorem for adapted weak convergence, reformulate the equivalence of stochastic processes using Markovian lifts, and give an expression for the adapted Wasserstein distance based on representing processes on a common stochastic basis.</description>

      <title>On polynomial recurrence property of "Markov-up" processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of [Kalikaeva, MPRF, 23(2):225-240]. The object of study is ``Markov-up processes'' on $\mathbb Z_+$ and the moment of downcrossing a certain barrier. The processes considered in this paper differ from Markov ones by the presence of a memory in certain parts of the trajectory. In our previous paper [Kalikaeva, MPRF, 23(2):225-240] exponential recurrence conditions were established. In this paper polynomial recurrence properties are considered under certain new assumptions.</description>

      <title>On quantitative convergence for stochastic processes: Crossings, fluctuations and martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for extracting highly uniform bounds on local stability for stochastic processes in terms of information on fluctuations or crossings. This includes a large class of martingales: As a corollary of our main abstract result, we obtain a quantitative version of Doob's convergence theorem for $L_1$-sub- and supermartingales, but more importantly, demonstrate that our framework readily extends to more complex stochastic processes such as almost-supermartingales, thus paving the way for future applications in stochastic optimization. Fundamental to our approach is the use of ideas from logic, particularly a careful analysis of the quantifier structure of probabilistic statements and the introduction of a number of abstract notions that represent stochastic convergence in a quantitative manner. In this sense, our work falls under the 'proof mining' program, and indeed, our quantitative results provide new examples of the phenomenon, recently made precise by the first author and Pischke, that many proofs in probability theory are proof-theoretically tame, and amenable to the extraction of quantitative data that is both of low complexity and independent of the underlying probability space.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and non-hyperuniformity of zeros of Gaussian Weyl-Heisenberg Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study zero sets of twisted stationary Gaussian random functions on the complex plane, i.e., Gaussian random functions that are stochastically invariant under the action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group. This model includes translation invariant Gaussian entire functions (GEFs), and also many other non-analytic examples, in which case winding numbers around zeros can be either positive or negative. We investigate zero statistics both when zeros are weighted with their winding numbers (charged zero set) and when they are not (uncharged zero set).
  We show that the variance of the charged zero statistic always grows linearly with the radius of the observation disk (hyperuniformity). Importantly, this holds for functions with possibly non-zero means and without assuming additional symmetries such as radiality. With respect to uncharged zero statistics, we provide an example for which the variance grows with the area of the observation disk (non-hyperuniformity). This is used to show that, while the zeros of GEFs are hyperuniform, the set of their critical points fails to be so.
  Our work contributes to recent developments in statistical signal processing, where the time-frequency profile of a non-stationary signal embedded into noise is revealed by performing a statistical test on the zeros of its spectrogram (``silent points''). We show that empirical spectrogram zero counts enjoy moderate deviation from their ensemble averages over large observation windows (something that was previously known only for pure noise). In contrast, we also show that spectogram maxima (``loud points") fail to enjoy a similar property. This gives the first formal evidence for the statistical superiority of silent points over the competing feature of loud points, a fact that has been noted by practitioners.</description>

      <title>Predator-prey density-dependent branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two density-dependent branching processes are considered to model predator-prey populations. For both models, preys are considered to be the main food supply of predators. Moreover, in each generation the number of individuals of each species is distributed according to a binomial distribution with size given by the species population size and probability of success depending on the density of preys per predator at the current generation. The difference between the two proposed processes lies in the food supply of preys. In the first one, we consider that preys have all the food they need at their disposal while in the second one, we assume that the natural resources of the environment are limited and therefore there exists a competition among preys for food supplies. Results on the fixation and extinction of both species as well as conditions for the coexistence are provided for the first model. On the event of coexistence of both populations and on the prey fixation event, the limiting growth rates are obtained. For the second model, we prove that the extinction of the entire system occurs almost surely. Finally, the evolution of both models over the generations is illustrated by simulated examples. Those examples validate our analytical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose simple yet effective empirical improvements to the algorithms of the LIPO family, introduced in [Malherbe2017], that we call LIPO+ and AdaLIPO+. We compare our methods to the vanilla versions of the algorithms over standard benchmark functions and show that they converge significantly faster. Finally, we show that the LIPO family is very prone to the curse of dimensionality and tends quickly to Pure Random Search when the dimension increases. We give a proof for this, which is also formalized in Lean mathematical language. Source codes and a demo are provided online.</description>

      <title>Gaussian upper bounds, volume doubling and Sobolev inequalities on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the equivalence of Sobolev inequalities and the conjunction of Gaussian upper heat kernel bounds and volume doubling on large scales on graphs. For the normalizing measure, we obtain their equivalence up to constants by imposing comparability of small balls and the vertex degree at their centers. If arbitrary measures are considered, we incorporate a new local regularity condition. Furthermore, new correction functions for the Gaussian, doubling, and Sobolev dimension are introduced. For the Gaussian and doubling, the variable correction functions always tend to one at infinity. Moreover, the variable Sobolev dimension can be related to the doubling dimension and the vertex degree growth.</description>

      <title>On cases where Litt's game is fair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fair coin is flipped $n$ times, and two finite sequences of heads and tails (words) $A$ and $B$ of the same length are given. Each time the word $A$ appears in the sequence of coin flips, Alice gets a point, and each time the word $B$ appears, Bob gets a point. Who is more likely to win? This puzzle is a slight extension of Litt's game that recently set Twitter abuzz. We show that Litt's game is fair for any value of $n$ and any two words that have the same auto-correlation structure by building up a bijection that exchanges Bob and Alice scores; the fact that the inter-correlation does not come into play in this case may come up as a surprise.</description>

      <title>Criteria for entropic curvature on graph spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish new simple local geometric criteria for discrete entropic curvature introduced in [47] that are powerful enough to capture many geometric properties of complex models arising in mathematical physics. These results are robust in the sense that they apply to any discrete graph equipped with a Markov reversible generator. Our definitions of entropic curvature differ from the one of the pioneering works of Erbar-Maas [19,20] (which is already a discrete analog of the Lott-Sturm-Villani entropic curvature in the continuous setting). Singularly, our results provide refined concentration properties related to the celebrated convex-hull method by Talagrand [50,51] for a large class of probability measures that cannot be captured from Erbar- Maas entropic definition of curvature. Our approach gives also a new insight of the convex hull method, without being related to induction arguments. We illustrate the power of our results, as well as the general entropic strategy developed in this paper, to tackle challenging models studied in mathematical physics, including Gibbs measures with interaction potentials such as Ising models on the discrete hypercube and measures with interaction potential on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. For instance, we significantly improve the constant of the refined convex concentration properties obtained in [2] for Ising models. Moreover, when dealing with the antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss model, we improve the previously known bound for entropic curvature by a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. Our simple criteria also provides the expected right order of magnitude $C/\sqrt n$ for the lower-bound on the entropic curvature for the renowned Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model from the spin glass theory. This last result is consistant with the recent works [6,17] on the modified logarithmic Sobolev and Poincar\'e inequalities for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model.</description>

      <title>Recurrence relations for the joint distribution of the sum and maximum of independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the joint distribution of the sum and maximum of independent, not necessarily identically distributed, nonnegative random variables is studied for two cases: i) continuous and ii) discrete random variables. First, a recursive formula of the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) is derived in both cases. Then, recurrence relations of the joint probability density function (PDF) and the joint probability mass function (PMF) are given in the former and the latter case, respectively. Interestingly, there is a fundamental difference between the joint PDF and PMF. The proofs are simple and mainly based on the following tools from calculus and discrete mathematics: differentiation under the integral sign (also known as Leibniz's integral rule), the law of total probability, and mathematical induction. In addition, this work generalizes previous results in the literature, and finally presents several extensions of the methodology.</description>

      <title>On the Atypical Solutions of the Symmetric Binary Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the random binary symmetric perceptron problem, focusing on the behavior of rare high-margin solutions. While most solutions are isolated, we demonstrate that these rare solutions are part of clusters of extensive entropy, heuristically corresponding to non-trivial fixed points of an approximate message-passing algorithm. We enumerate these clusters via a local entropy, defined as a Franz-Parisi potential, which we rigorously evaluate using the first and second moment methods in the limit of a small constraint density $\alpha$ (corresponding to vanishing margin $\kappa$) under a certain assumption on the concentration of the entropy. This examination unveils several intriguing phenomena: i) We demonstrate that these clusters have an entropic barrier in the sense that the entropy as a function of the distance from the reference high-margin solution is non-monotone when $\kappa \le 1.429 \sqrt{-\alpha/\log{\alpha}}$, while it is monotone otherwise, and that they have an energetic barrier in the sense that there are no solutions at an intermediate distance from the reference solution when $\kappa \le 1.239 \sqrt{-\alpha/ \log{\alpha}}$. The critical scaling of the margin $\kappa$ in $\sqrt{-\alpha/\log\alpha}$ corresponds to the one obtained from the earlier work of Gamarnik et al. (2022) for the overlap-gap property, a phenomenon known to present a barrier to certain efficient algorithms. ii) We establish using the replica method that the complexity (the logarithm of the number of clusters of such solutions) versus entropy (the logarithm of the number of solutions in the clusters) curves are partly non-concave and correspond to very large values of the Parisi parameter, with the equilibrium being reached when the Parisi parameter diverges.</description>

      <title>Closure properties and heavy tails: random vectors in the presence of dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is organized in three parts closely related to closure properties of heavy-tailed distributions and heavy-tailed random vectors. In the first part we consider two random variables X and Y with distributions F and G respectively. We assume that these random variables satisfy one type of a weak dependence structure. Under some mild conditions, we examine whether their product convolution distribution H belongs in the same distribution class of the distribution F. Namely we establish the closure property with respect to the product convolution, under this specific weak dependence structure, in the classes ERV, C, D, M, OS, OL, PD and K. Further in the second part we introduce a new distribution class, which satisfies some closure properties such as convolution, product convolution and mixture. Although the multivariate regular variation is well-established distribution, it does not happen in other heavy tailed random vectors. Therefore in the third part we introduced the class of dominatedly varying vectors and positively decreasing random vectors and we study the closure property of the scalar product under independent and dependent cases. Furthermore we study the closure property of the first class under convolution and mixture, and we study the distribution of stopped sums where the summands are random vectors which belongs to this class. Some of these results holds and for positively decreasing random vectors.</description>

      <title>Double dimers on planar hyperbolic graphs via circle packings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the double dimer model on hyperbolic Temperleyan graphs via circle packings. We prove that on such graphs, the weak limit of the dimer model exists if and only if the removed black vertex from the boundary of the exhaustion converges to a point on the unit circle in the circle packing representation of the graph. One of our main results is that for such measures, we prove that the double dimer model has no bi-infinite path almost surely. Along the way we prove that the height function of the dimer model has double exponential tail and faces of height larger than k do not percolate for large enough k. The proof uses the connection between winding of uniform spanning trees and dimer heights, the notion of stationary random graphs, and the boundary theory of random walk on circle packings.</description>

Abstract: A new version of a sufficient condition of a Dobrushin type is proposed for non-homogeneous Markov chains for a certain class of such processes. The original Dobrushin's condition may fail, yet, the CLT is still valid</description>

      <title>Prophet Inequalities: Separating Random Order from Order Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04024</link>

Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. A gambler is sent values in an online fashion, sampled from an instance of independent distributions, in an adversarial, random or selected order, depending on the model. When observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  The model, in which the gambler selects the arrival order first, and then observes the values, is known as Order Selection. In this model a ratio of $0.7251$ is attainable for any instance. Recently, this has been improved up to $0.7258$ by Bubna and Chiplunkar (2023). If the gambler chooses the arrival order (uniformly) at random, we obtain the Random Order model. The worst case ratio over all possible instances has been extensively studied for at least $40$ years. Through simulations, Bubna and Chiplunkar (2023) also showed that this ratio is at most $0.7254$ for the Random Order model, thus establishing for the first time that carefully choosing the order, instead of simply taking it at random, benefits the gambler. We give an alternative, non-simulation-assisted proof of this fact, by showing mathematically that in the Random Order model, no algorithm can achieve a ratio larger than $0.7235$. This sets a new state-of-the-art hardness for this model, and establishes more formally that there is a real benefit in choosing the order.</description>

      <title>A Short Report on the Probability-Based Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper calls attention to the current state of the probability (P) domain which presents weak points at the mathematical level and more significant flaws at the application level. Popper notices how fundamental issues raised in quantum mechanics (QM) directly derive from unresolved probabilistic questions. Endless philosophical debates create more problems than solutions, so the author of this research suggests going directly to the root of the issues and searching for the probability theory which formalizes the multifold nature of P. This paper offers a brief overview of the structural theory of probability, recently published in a book, and applies it to QM in order to show its completeness. The whole probability-based interpretation of QM goes beyond the limits of a paper and these pages condense a few aspects of this theoretical scheme. The double slit experiment is used to corroborate the theorems presented here.</description>

      <title>Different relative scalings between transient forces and thermal fluctuations tune regimes of chromatin organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the nucleus, structural maintenance of chromosome protein complexes, namely condensin and cohesin, create an architecture to facilitate the organization and proper function of the genome. Condensin, in addition to performing loop extrusion, creates localized clusters of chromatin in the nucleolus through transient crosslinks. Large-scale simulations revealed three different dynamic behaviors as a function of timescale: slow crosslinking leads to no clusters, fast crosslinking produces rigid slowly changing clusters, while intermediate timescales produce flexible clusters that mediate gene interaction. By mathematically analyzing different relative scalings of the two sources of stochasticity, thermal fluctuations and the force induced by the transient crosslinks, we predict these three distinct regimes of cluster behavior. Standard time-averaging that takes the fluctuations of the transient crosslink force to zero predicts the existence of rigid clusters. Accounting for the interaction of both fluctuations from the crosslinks and thermal noise with an effective energy landscape predicts the timescale-dependent lifetimes of flexible clusters. No clusters are predicted when the fluctuations of the transient crosslink force are taken to be large relative to thermal fluctuations. This mathematical perturbation analysis illuminates the importance of accounting for stochasticity in local incoherent transient forces to predict emergent complex biological behavior.</description>
