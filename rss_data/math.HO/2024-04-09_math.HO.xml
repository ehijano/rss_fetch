      <title>Comparative Study of Sand Drawings in Oceania and Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People typically consider only European mathematics as orthodox, often intentionally or unintentionally overlooking the existence of mathematics from non-European societies. Inspired by Maria Ascher's two well-known papers on sand drawings in Oceania and Africa, this paper focuses on the strong link between modern mathematics and the mathematics behind the sand drawings. Beginning with a comparison of the geography, history, and the cultural context of sand drawings in Oceania and Africa, we will examine shared geometric features of European graph theory and Indigenous sand drawings, including continuity, cyclicity, and symmetry. The paper will also delve into the origin of graph theory, exploring whether the famous European mathematician Leonhard Euler, who published his solution to the Konigsberg bridge problem in 1736, was the true inventor of graph theory. The potential for incorporating sand drawings into the school curriculum is highlighted at the end. Overall, this paper aims to make readers realise the importance of ethnomathematics studies and appreciate the intelligence of Indigenous people.</description>

      <title>Tables in Leibniz: a challenge for the digital humanities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leibniz's mathematical texts are a perfect example of a type of historical document that is extremely difficult to deal with in the context of an editorial enterprise: the draft. The tables in Leibniz's mathematical manuscripts are a particularly good example of these difficulties, as they are equivocal sources containing many implicit operations. The publication of these texts raises the question of the nature of these signs and the economy of implicit relationships between their various components. Peirce's semiological approach provides the philosophical ground for these reflections, while Michel Serres's structuralism is a fertile source of inspiration. The digital tool holds much promise for many issues, including the particular difficulties of tables. We will show that it can be implemented by different computer structures which largely determine the way the historian conceives them a priori but also the way the reader receives them a posteriori. Finally, the tables are the simple case that founds a general problematic on the interpretation of many manuscripts and allows us to study the problem of the writing process at its root.</description>

      <title>Mathematics of the MML functional quantizer modules for VCV Rack software synthesizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail the mathematical formulation of the line of "functional quantizer" modules developed by the Mathematics and Music Lab (MML) at Michigan Technological University, for the VCV Rack software modular synthesizer platform, which allow synthesizer players to tune oscillators to new musical scales based on mathematical functions. For example, we describe the recently-released MML Logarithmic Quantizer (LOG QNT) module that tunes synthesizer oscillators to the non-Pythagorean musical scale introduced by pop band The Apples in Stereo.</description>

      <title>Waterproof: Educational Software for Learning How to Write Mathematical Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to help students learn how to write mathematical proofs, we adapt the Coq proof assistant into an educational tool we call Waterproof. Like with other interactive theorem provers, students write out their proofs inside the software using a specific syntax, and the software provides feedback on the logical validity of each step. Waterproof consists of two components: a custom proof language that allows formal, machine-verified proofs to be written in a style that closely resembles handwritten proofs, and a custom editor that allows these proofs to be combined with formatted text to improve readability. The editor can be used for Coq documents in general, but also offers special features designed for use in education. Student input, for example, can be limited to specific parts of the document to prevent exercises from being accidentally deleted. Waterproof has been used to supplement teaching the Analysis 1 course at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) for the last four years. Students started using the specific formulations of proof steps from the custom proof language in their handwritten proofs; the explicit phrasing of these sentences helped to clarify the logical structure of their arguments.</description>
