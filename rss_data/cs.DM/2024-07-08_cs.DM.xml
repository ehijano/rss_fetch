      <title>Algorithmic Results for Weak Roman Domination Problem in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a graph $G = (V, E)$ and a function $f: V \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}$. A vertex $u$ with $f(u)=0$ is defined as \emph{undefended} by $f$ if it lacks adjacency to any vertex with a positive $f$-value. The function $f$ is said to be a \emph{Weak Roman Dominating function} (WRD function) if, for every vertex $u$ with $f(u) = 0$, there exists a neighbour $v$ of $u$ with $f(v) &gt; 0$ and a new function $f': V \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}$ defined in the following way: $f'(u) = 1$, $f'(v) = f(v) - 1$, and $f'(w) = f(w)$, for all vertices $w$ in $V\setminus\{u,v\}$; so that no vertices are undefended by $f'$. The total weight of $f$ is equal to $\sum_{v\in V} f(v)$, and is denoted as $w(f)$. The \emph{Weak Roman Domination Number} denoted by $\gamma_r(G)$, represents $min\{w(f)~\vert~f$ is a WRD function of $G\}$. For a given graph $G$, the problem of finding a WRD function of weight $\gamma_r(G)$ is defined as the \emph{Minimum Weak Roman domination problem}. The problem is already known to be NP-hard for bipartite and chordal graphs. In this paper, we further study the algorithmic complexity of the problem. We prove the NP-hardness of the problem for star convex bipartite graphs and comb convex bipartite graphs, which are subclasses of bipartite graphs. In addition, we show that for the bounded degree star convex bipartite graphs, the problem is efficiently solvable. We also prove the NP-hardness of the problem for split graphs, a subclass of chordal graphs. On the positive side, we give polynomial-time algorithms to solve the problem for $P_4$-sparse graphs. Further, we have presented some approximation results.</description>

      <title>Optimal Mixing for Randomly Sampling Edge Colorings on Trees Down to the Max Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the convergence rate of Markov chains for randomly generating an edge coloring of a given tree. Our focus is on the Glauber dynamics which updates the color at a randomly chosen edge in each step. For a tree $T$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $\Delta$, when the number of colors $q$ satisfies $q\geq\Delta+2$ then we prove that the Glauber dynamics has an optimal relaxation time of $O(n)$, where the relaxation time is the inverse of the spectral gap. This is optimal in the range of $q$ in terms of $\Delta$ as Dyer, Goldberg, and Jerrum (2006) showed that the relaxation time is $\Omega(n^3)$ when $q=\Delta+1$. For the case $q=\Delta+1$, we show that an alternative Markov chain which updates a pair of neighboring edges has relaxation time $O(n)$. Moreover, for the $\Delta$-regular complete tree we prove $O(n\log^2{n})$ mixing time bounds for the respective Markov chain. Our proofs establish approximate tensorization of variance via a novel inductive approach, where the base case is a tree of height $\ell=O(\Delta^2\log^2{\Delta})$, which we analyze using a canonical paths argument.</description>

      <title>On a Traveling Salesman Problem for Points in the Unit Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02839v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an $n$-element point set in the $k$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^k$ where $k \geq 2$. According to an old result of Bollob\'as and Meir (1992), there exists a cycle (tour) $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ through the $n$ points, such that $\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - x_{i+1}|^k \right)^{1/k} \leq c_k$, where $|x-y|$ is the Euclidean distance between $x$ and $y$, and $c_k$ is an absolute constant that depends only on $k$, where $x_{n+1} \equiv x_1$. From the other direction, for every $k \geq 2$ and $n \geq 2$, there exist $n$ points in $[0,1]^k$, such that their shortest tour satisfies $\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - x_{i+1}|^k \right)^{1/k} = 2^{1/k} \cdot \sqrt{k}$. For the plane, the best constant is $c_2=2$ and this is the only exact value known. Bollob{\'a}s and Meir showed that one can take $c_k = 9 \left(\frac23 \right)^{1/k} \cdot \sqrt{k}$ for every $k \geq 3$ and conjectured that the best constant is $c_k = 2^{1/k} \cdot \sqrt{k}$, for every $k \geq 2$. Here we significantly improve the upper bound and show that one can take $c_k = 3 \sqrt5 \left(\frac23 \right)^{1/k} \cdot \sqrt{k}$ or $c_k = 2.91 \sqrt{k} \ (1+o_k(1))$. Our bounds are constructive. We also show that $c_3 \geq 2^{7/6}$, which disproves the conjecture for $k=3$.
  Connections to matching problems, power assignment problems, related problems, including algorithms, are discussed in this context. A slightly revised version of the Bollob\'as--Meir conjecture is proposed.</description>

      <title>Weighted basic parallel processes and combinatorial enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study weighted basic parallel processes (WBPP), a nonlinear recursive generalisation of weighted finite automata inspired from process algebra and Petri net theory. Our main result is an algorithm of 2-EXPSPACE complexity for the WBPP equivalence problem. While (unweighted) BPP language equivalence is undecidable, we can use this algorithm to decide multiplicity equivalence of BPP and language equivalence of unambiguous BPP, with the same complexity. These are long-standing open problems for the related model of weighted context-free grammars. Our second contribution is a connection between WBPP, power series solutions of systems of polynomial differential equations, and combinatorial enumeration. To this end we consider constructible differentially finite power series (CDF), a class of multivariate differentially algebraic series introduced by Bergeron and Reutenauer in order to provide a combinatorial interpretation to differential equations. CDF series generalise rational, algebraic, and a large class of D-finite (holonomic) series, for which decidability of equivalence was an open problem. We show that CDF series correspond to commutative WBPP series. As a consequence of our result on WBPP and commutativity, we show that equivalence of CDF power series can be decided with 2-EXPTIME complexity. The complexity analysis is based on effective bounds from algebraic geometry, namely on the length of chains of polynomial ideals constructed by repeated application of finitely many, not necessarily commuting derivations of a multivariate polynomial ring. This is obtained by generalising a result of Novikov and Yakovenko in the case of a single derivation, which is noteworthy since generic bounds on ideal chains are non-primitive recursive in general. On the way, we develop the theory of \WBPP~series and \CDF~power series, exposing several of their appealing properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring Algorithmic Solutions for the Independent Roman Domination Problem in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a function $f:V\to \{0,1,2\}$ is said to be a \emph{Roman Dominating function} if for every $v\in V$ with $f(v)=0$, there exists a vertex $u\in N(v)$ such that $f(u)=2$. A Roman Dominating function $f$ is said to be an \emph{Independent Roman Dominating function} (or IRDF), if $V_1\cup V_2$ forms an independent set, where $V_i=\{v\in V~\vert~f(v)=i\}$, for $i\in \{0,1,2\}$. The total weight of $f$ is equal to $\sum_{v\in V} f(v)$, and is denoted as $w(f)$. The \emph{Independent Roman Domination Number} of $G$, denoted by $i_R(G)$, is defined as min$\{w(f)~\vert~f$ is an IRDF of $G\}$. For a given graph $G$, the problem of computing $i_R(G)$ is defined as the \emph{Minimum Independent Roman Domination problem}. The problem is already known to be NP-hard for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we further study the algorithmic complexity of the problem.
  In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the Minimum Independent Roman Domination problem for distance-hereditary graphs, split graphs, and $P_4$-sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Connectivity of the Flip Graph of Plane Spanning Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flip graphs of non-crossing configurations in the plane are widely studied objects, e.g., flip graph of triangulations, spanning trees, Hamiltonian cycles, and perfect matchings. Typically, it is an easy exercise to prove connectivity of a flip graph. In stark contrast, the connectivity of the flip graph of plane spanning paths on point sets in general position has been an open problem for more than 16 years.
  In order to provide new insights, we investigate certain induced subgraphs. Firstly, we provide tight bounds on the diameter and the radius of the flip graph of spanning paths on points in convex position with one fixed endpoint. Secondly, we show that so-called suffix-independent paths induce a connected subgraph. Consequently, to answer the open problem affirmatively, it suffices to show that each path can be flipped to some suffix-independent path. Lastly, we investigate paths where one endpoint is fixed and provide tools to flip to suffix-independent paths. We show that these tools are strong enough to show connectivity of the flip graph of plane spanning paths on point sets with at most two convex layers.</description>

      <title>Factorized binary polynomial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In binary polynomial optimization, the goal is to find a binary point maximizing a given polynomial function. In this paper, we propose a novel way of formulating this general optimization problem, which we call factorized binary polynomial optimization. In this formulation, we assume that the variables are partitioned into a fixed number of sets, and that the objective function is written as a sum of r products of linear functions, each one involving only variables in one set of the partition. Our main result is an algorithm that solves factorized binary polynomial optimization in strongly polynomial time, when r is fixed. This result provides a vast new class of tractable instances of binary polynomial optimization, and it even improves on the state-of-the-art for quadratic objective functions, both in terms of generality and running time. We demonstrate the applicability of our result through the binary tensor factorization problem, which arises in mining discrete patterns in data, and that contains as a special case the rank-1 Boolean tensor factorization problem. Our main result implies that these problems can be solved in strongly polynomial time, if the input tensor has fixed rank, and a rank factorization is given. For the rank-1 Boolean matrix factorization problem, we only require that the input matrix has fixed rank.</description>

      <title>Spectral Methods for Matrix Product Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is factored into graphs $H$ and $K$ via a matrix product if there exist adjacency matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$ of $G$, $H$, and $K$, respectively, such that $A = BC$. In this paper, we study the spectral aspects of the matrix product of graphs, including regularity, bipartiteness, and connectivity. We show that if a graph $G$ is factored into a connected graph $H$ and a graph $K$ with no isolated vertices, then certain properties hold. If $H$ is non-bipartite, then $G$ is connected. If $H$ is bipartite and $G$ is not connected, then $K$ is a regular bipartite graph, and consequently, $n$ is even. Furthermore, we show that trees are not factorizable, which answers a question posed by Maghsoudi et al.</description>

      <title>Improved Outerplanarity Bounds for Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the outerplanarity of planar graphs, i.e., the number of times that we must (in a planar embedding that we can initially freely choose) remove the outerface vertices until the graph is empty. It is well-known that there are $n$-vertex graphs with outerplanarity $\tfrac{n}{6}+\Theta(1)$, and not difficult to show that the outerplanarity can never be bigger. We give here improved bounds of the form $\tfrac{n}{2g}+2g+O(1)$, where $g$ is the fence-girth, i.e., the length of the shortest cycle with vertices on both sides. This parameter $g$ is at least the connectivity of the graph, and often bigger; for example, our results imply that planar bipartite graphs have outerplanarity $\tfrac{n}{8}+O(1)$. We also show that the outerplanarity of a planar graph $G$ is at most $\tfrac{1}{2}$diam$(G)+O(\sqrt{n})$, where diam$(G)$ is the diameter of the graph. All our bounds are tight up to smaller-order terms, and a planar embedding that achieves the outerplanarity bound can be found in linear time.</description>

      <title>Bicriterial Approximation for the Incremental Prize-Collecting Steiner-Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an incremental variant of the rooted prize-collecting Steiner-tree problem with a growing budget constraint. While no incremental solution exists that simultaneously approximates the optimum for all budgets, we show that a bicriterial $(\alpha,\mu)$-approximation is possible, i.e., a solution that with budget $B+\alpha$ for all $B \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is a multiplicative $\mu$-approximation compared to the optimum solution with budget $B$. For the case that the underlying graph is a tree, we present a polynomial-time density-greedy algorithm that computes a $(\chi,1)$-approximation, where $\chi$ denotes the eccentricity of the root vertex in the underlying graph, and show that this is best possible. An adaptation of the density-greedy algorithm for general graphs is $(\gamma,2)$-competitive where $\gamma$ is the maximal length of a vertex-disjoint path starting in the root. While this algorithm does not run in polynomial time, it can be adapted to a $(\gamma,3)$-competitive algorithm that runs in polynomial time. We further devise a capacity-scaling algorithm that guarantees a $(3\chi,8)$-approximation and, more generally, a $\smash{\bigl((4\ell - 1)\chi, \frac{2^{\ell + 2}}{2^{\ell}-1}\bigr)}$-approximation for every fixed $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Weak coloring numbers of minor-closed graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the growth rate of weak coloring numbers of graphs excluding a fixed graph as a minor. Van den Heuvel et al. (European J. of Combinatorics, 2017) showed that for a fixed graph $X$, the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number of $X$-minor-free graphs is polynomial in $r$. We determine this polynomial up to a factor of $\mathcal{O}(r \log r)$. Moreover, we tie the exponent of the polynomial to a structural property of $X$, namely, $2$-treedepth. As a result, for a fixed graph $X$ and an $X$-minor-free graph $G$, we show that $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)= \mathcal{O}(r^{\mathrm{td}(X)-1}\mathrm{log}\ r)$, which improves on the bound $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G) = \mathcal{O}(r^{g(\mathrm{td}(X))})$ given by Dujmovi\'c et al. (SODA, 2024), where $g$ is an exponential function. In the case of planar graphs of bounded treewidth, we show that the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number is in $\mathcal{O}(r^2\mathrm{log}\ r$), which is best possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two new classes of covering codes in graphs for every positive integer $r$. These new codes are called local $r$-identifying and local $r$-locating-dominating codes and they are derived from $r$-identifying and $r$-locating-dominating codes, respectively. We study the sizes of optimal local 1-identifying codes in binary hypercubes. We obtain lower and upper bounds that are asymptotically tight. Together the bounds show that the cost of changing covering codes into local 1-identifying codes is negligible. For some small $n$ optimal constructions are obtained. Moreover, the upper bound is obtained by a linear code construction. Also, we study the densities of optimal local 1-identifying codes and local 1-locating-dominating codes in the infinite square grid, the hexagonal grid, the triangular grid, and the king grid. We prove that seven out of eight of our constructions have optimal densities.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a game where players selfishly choose a resource and endure a cost depending on the number of players choosing nearby resources. We model the influences among resources by a weighted graph, directed or not. These games are generalizations of well-known games like Wardrop and congestion games. We study the conditions of equilibria existence and their efficiency if they exist. We conclude with studies of games whose influences among resources can be modelled by simple graphs.</description>

Abstract: A set $C$ of vertices in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is an identifying code if it is dominating and any two vertices of $V$ are dominated by distinct sets of codewords. This paper presents a survey of Iiro Honkala's contributions to the study of identifying codes with respect to several aspects: complexity of computing an identifying code, combinatorics in binary Hamming spaces, infinite grids, relationships between identifying codes and usual parameters in graphs, structural properties of graphs admitting identifying codes, and number of optimal identifying codes.</description>

Abstract: A longstanding open problem asks for an aperiodic monotile, also known as an "einstein": a shape that admits tilings of the plane, but never periodic tilings. We answer this problem for topological disk tiles by exhibiting a continuum of combinatorially equivalent aperiodic polygons. We first show that a representative example, the "hat" polykite, can form clusters called "metatiles", for which substitution rules can be defined. Because the metatiles admit tilings of the plane, so too does the hat. We then prove that generic members of our continuum of polygons are aperiodic, through a new kind of geometric incommensurability argument. Separately, we give a combinatorial, computer-assisted proof that the hat must form hierarchical -- and hence aperiodic -- tilings.</description>

      <title>Approximating branchwidth on parametric extensions of planarity</title>

Abstract: The branchwidth of a graph has been introduced by Roberson and Seymour as a measure of the tree-decomposability of a graph, alternative to treewidth. Branchwidth is polynomially computable on planar graphs by the celebrated ``Ratcatcher''-algorithm of Seymour and Thomas. We investigate an extension of this algorithm to minor-closed graph classes, further than planar graphs, as follows: Let $H_{1}$ be a graph embeddable in the torus and $H_{2}$ be a graph embeddable in the projective plane. We prove that every $\{H_{1},H_{2}\}$-minor free graph $G$ contains a subgraph $G'$ where the difference between the branchwidth of $G$ and the branchwidth of $G'$ is bounded by some constant, depending only on $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$. Moreover, the graph $G'$ admits a tree decomposition where all torsos are planar. This decomposition can be used for deriving a constant-additive approximation for branchwidth: For $\{H_{1},H_{2}\}$-minor free graphs, there is a constant $c$ (depending on $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$) and an $\Ocal(|V(G)|^{3})$-time algorithm that, given a graph $G$, outputs a value $b$ such that the branchwidth of $G$ is between $b$ and $b+c$.</description>

      <title>A Gr\"obner Approach to Dual-Containing Cyclic Left Module $(\theta,\delta)$-Codes over Finite Commutative Frobenius Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a skew polynomial ring $R=A[X;\theta,\delta]$ where $A$ is a commutative Frobenius ring, $\theta$ an endomorphism of $A$ and $\delta$ a $\theta$-derivation of $A$, we consider cyclic left module codes $\mathcal{C}=Rg/Rf\subset R/Rf$ where $g$ is a left and right divisor of $f$ in $R$. In this paper, we derive a parity check matrix when $A$ is a finite commutative Frobenius ring using only the framework of skew polynomial rings. We consider rings $A=B[a_1,\ldots,a_s]$ which are free $B$-modules where the restriction of $\delta$ and $\theta$ to $B$ are polynomial maps. If a Gr\"obner basis can be computed over $B$, then we show that all Euclidean and Hermitian dual-containing codes $\mathcal{C}=Rg/Rf\subset R/Rf$ can be computed using a Gr\"obner basis. We also give an algorithm to test if the dual code is again a cyclic left module code. We illustrate our approach for rings of order $4$ with non-trivial endomorphism and the Galois ring of characteristic $4$.</description>

      <title>Tight (Double) Exponential Bounds for Identification Problems: Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate fine-grained algorithmic aspects of identification problems in graphs and set systems, with a focus on Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover. We prove the (tight) conditional lower bounds for these problems when parameterized by treewidth and solution as. Formally, \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} (respectively, \textsc{Test Cover}) parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph (respectively, of the natural auxiliary graph) does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot poly(n)$ (respectively, $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\mathcal{F}|))$. This result augments the small list of NP-Complete problems that admit double exponential lower bounds when parameterized by treewidth. Then, we first prove that \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{o(k^2)} \cdot poly(n)$, nor a polynomial time kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with $2^{o(k)}$ vertices, unless the \ETH\ fails. To the best of our knowledge, \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} is the first problem that admits such an algorithmic lower-bound (with a quadratic function in the exponent) when parameterized by the solution size. Finally, we prove that \textsc{Test Cover} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(k)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\mathcal{F}|)$. This is also a rare example of the problem that admits a double exponential lower bound when parameterized by the solution size.
  We also present algorithms whose running times match the above lower bounds.</description>
