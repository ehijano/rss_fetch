      <title>Entanglement Degradation in Curved Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how gravitational time dilation affects the coherence and entanglement dynamics of spatially separated qubits using open quantum systems theory. Unlike earlier works that consider only static or Markovian noise models, our approach incorporates phase damping, amplitude damping, and thermal excitation, along with a non-Markovian extension. By embedding gravitational redshift into the local decoherence rates, we demonstrate asymmetry in entanglement degradation and reveal the possibility of revivals in structured environments. Our findings have implications for relativistic quantum communication and space-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for equational reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce quantum normal form reduction, a quantum computational framework for analyzing abstract symbolic expressions - such as strings, algebraic formulas, or quantum circuits - that are equivalent under a given set of transformation rules. These rules form a term rewriting system, a formal method for deriving equivalences by repeatedly applying substitutions. We construct an efficiently implementable quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the entire class of equivalent expressions - potentially exponentially many - in a quantum superposition. By preparing and manipulating these ground states, we address fundamental problems in equational reasoning, including the word problem, i.e., determining whether two expressions are equivalent, counting the number of equivalent expressions, and identifying structural properties of equivalence classes. We demonstrate a quantum-inspired version of the algorithm using tensor network simulations by solving instances involving up to $10^{28}$ equivalent expressions, well beyond the reach of standard classical graph exploration techniques. This framework opens the path for quantum symbolic computation in areas ranging from quantum and logical circuit design to data compression, computational group theory, linguistics, polymers and biomolecular modeling, enabling the investigation of problems previously out of reach.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Solvers in Noisy Digital Simulations for Financial Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we benchmark two prominent quantum algorithms: Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (QITE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for obtaining the ground state of Ising-type Hamiltonians. Specifically, we apply them to the Markowitz portfolio optimization problem in quantitative finance, on both digital quantum computers and local quantum simulators with controllable two-qubit errors (noise). In noiseless settings, we find that QAOA achieves excellent convergence to the optimal results. Under noisy conditions, the QITE method exhibits greater robustness and stability, though it incurs substantially more classical numerical cost. In contrast, we demonstrate that QAOA offers better scalability and can still yield robust results if the noise can be effectively mitigated. Our findings provide valuable insights into the trade-offs between scalability and noise tolerance and demonstrate the practical potential of quantum algorithms for solving real-world optimization problems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Optical Integration With Heralded Single Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform optical integration with heralded single photons and investigate the role played by the spatial correlation between the photons in this task. To address this, we experimentally investigate the use of the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light in an optical processing scheme utilizing heralded single photons. The integration is realized over the binary phases encoded with a phase-only spatial light modulator assisted by polarization. As a result, while spatially uncorrelated photons can capture the global properties of an image displayed in a spatial light modulator, correlated photons capture the local properties of the image better. Also, emphasize the strong connection between the optical integration scheme implemented here and the DQC1 (deterministic quantum computation with one qubit) model.</description>

      <title>Communication scenario enables robust self-testing of n-party Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger basis measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled basis measurements play a crucial role in distributing quantum entanglement between parties across a quantum network. In this work, we adopt a semi-device-independent approach that enables the self-testing of n-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) basis measurements without requiring shared entanglement between distant parties. Our method relies solely on input-output statistics from a communication scenario involving n spatially separated senders, each receiving two bits of input, and a single receiver with no input. We analyze the robustness of the proposed self-testing protocol. Additionally, we introduce a protocol for robust self-testing of the three-outcome partial Bell basis measurement that is easily implementable in an optical setup.</description>

      <title>LREI: A fast numerical solver for quantum Landau-Lifshitz equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop LREI (Low-Rank Eigenmode Integration), a memory- and time-efficient scheme for solving quantum Landau-Lifshitz (q-LL) and quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (q-LLG) equations, which govern spin dynamics in open quantum systems. Although system size grows exponentially with the number of spins, our approach exploits the low-rank structure of the density matrix and the sparsity of Hamiltonians to avoid full matrix computations. By representing density matrices via low-rank factors and applying Krylov subspace methods for partial eigendecompositions, we reduce the per-step complexity of Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth schemes from $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r^2N)$, where $N = 2^n$ is the Hilbert space dimension for $n$ spins and $r \ll N$ the effective rank. Similarly, memory costs shrink from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(rN)$, since no full $N\times N$ matrices are formed. A key advance is handling the invariant subspace of zero eigenvalues. By using Householder reflectors built for the dominant eigenspace, we perform the solution entirely without large matrices. For example, a time step of a twenty-spin system, with density matrix size over one million, now takes only seconds on a standard laptop. Both Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods are reformulated to preserve physical properties of the density matrix throughout evolution. This low-rank algorithm enables simulations of much larger spin systems, which were previously infeasible, providing a powerful tool for comparing q-LL and q-LLG dynamics, testing each model validity, and probing how quantum features such as correlations and entanglement evolve across different regimes of system size and damping.</description>

      <title>Unitary Synthesis with AlphaZero via Dynamic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary synthesis is the process of decomposing a target unitary transformation into a sequence of quantum gates. This is a challenging task, as the number of possible gate combinations grows exponentially with the circuit depth. In this manuscript, we propose an approach using an AlphaZero-inspired reinforcement-learning agent for the exact compilation of unitaries using discrete sets of logic gates. The approach achieves low inference time and proves versatile across different gate sets, and qubit connectivities. Leveraging this flexibility, we explore unitary synthesis with dynamic circuits -- circuits that contain non-unitary operations such as measurements and conditional gates -- and discover unusual implementations of logical quantum gates. Although the direct synthesis of complete algorithms is intractable, our approach is well suited for efficiently synthesizing subroutines. This may have a significant impact when these subroutines are invoked repeatedly during algorithm execution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing in supercomputing centers requires robust tools to analyze calibration datasets, predict hardware performance, and optimize operational workflows. This paper presents a data-driven framework for processing calibration metrics. Our model is based on a real calibration quality metrics dataset from our in-house 20-qubit NISQ device and for more than 250 days. We apply detailed data analysis to uncover temporal patterns and cross-metric correlations. Using unsupervised clustering, we identify stable and noisy qubits. We also validate our model using GHZ state experiments. Our study provides health indicators as well as hardware-driven maintenance and recalibration recommendations, thus motivating the integration of relevant schedulers with HPCQC workflows.</description>

      <title>HCQA: Hybrid Classical-Quantum Agent for Generating Optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an HCQA for designing optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits (QSCs) to address complex quantum physics problems. The HCQA integrates computational intelligence techniques by leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for learning and policy optimization, enhanced by a quantum-based action selection mechanism based on the Q-values. A quantum circuit encodes the agent current state using Ry gates, and then creates a superposition of possible actions. Measurement of the circuit results in probabilistic action outcomes, allowing the agent to generate optimal QSCs by selecting sequences of gates that maximize the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) while minimizing the number of gates. This computational intelligence-driven HCQA enables the automated generation of entangled quantum states, specifically the squeezed states, with high QFI sensitivity for quantum state estimation and control. Evaluation of the HCQA on a QSC that consists of two qubits and a sequence of Rx, Ry, and S gates demonstrates its efficiency in generating optimal QSCs with a QFI of 1. This work highlights the synergy between AI-driven learning and quantum computation, illustrating how intelligent agents can autonomously discover optimal quantum circuit designs for enhanced sensing and estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning for Optimizing Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Sensor Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, optimizing quantum circuits for specific tasks is crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology. The field is expected to provide new opportunities, especially regarding high sensitivity and precision. Entanglement is one of the key factors in achieving high sensitivity and measurement precision [3]. This paper presents a novel approach utilizing quantum machine learning techniques to optimize entanglement distribution in quantum sensor circuits. By leveraging reinforcement learning within a quantum environment, we aim to optimize the entanglement layout to maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy, which are key indicators of a quantum system's sensitivity and coherence, while minimizing circuit depth and gate counts. Our implementation, based on Qiskit, integrates noise models and error mitigation strategies to simulate realistic quantum environments. The results demonstrate significant improvements in circuit performance and sensitivity, highlighting the potential of machine learning in quantum circuit optimization by measuring high QFI and entropy in the range of 0.84-1.0 with depth and gate count reduction by 20-86%.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing Large Qubit Array based Quantum Sensor Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing and controlling the quantum circuits grows exponentially. Manually optimizing these circuits becomes infeasible. Optimizing entanglement distribution in large-scale quantum circuits is critical for enhancing the sensitivity and efficiency of quantum sensors [5], [6]. This paper presents an engineering integration of reinforcement learning with tensor-network-based simulation (MPS) for scalable circuit optimization for optimizing quantum sensor circuits with up to 60 qubits. To enable efficient simulation and scalability, we adopt tensor network methods, specifically the Matrix Product State (MPS) representation, instead of traditional state vector or density matrix approaches. Our reinforcement learning agent learns to restructure circuits to maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy while reducing gate counts and circuit depth. Experimental results show consistent improvements, with QFI values approaching 1, entanglement entropy in the 0.8-1.0 range, and up to 90% reduction in depth and gate count. These results highlight the potential of combining quantum machine learning and tensor networks to optimize complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantum Physics using Weighted Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted model counting (WMC) has proven effective at a range of tasks within computer science, physics, and beyond. However, existing approaches for using WMC in quantum physics only target specific problem instances, lacking a general framework for expressing problems using WMC. This limits the reusability of these approaches in other applications and risks a lack of mathematical rigor on a per-instance basis. We present an approach for expressing linear algebraic problems, specifically those present in physics and quantum computing, as WMC instances. We do this by introducing a framework that converts Dirac notation to WMC problems. We build up this framework theoretically, using a type system and denotational semantics, and provide an implementation in Python. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in calculating the partition functions of several physical models: The transverse-field Ising model (quantum) and the Potts model (classical). The results suggest that heuristics developed in automated reasoning can be systematically applied to a wide class of problems in quantum physics through our framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Natural Language Generation: A Multi-Model Framework with Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models: Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases, haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1 score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Transpilation in Quantum Machine Learning with Haiqu's Rivet-transpiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transpilation is a crucial process in preparing quantum circuits for execution on hardware, transforming virtual gates to match device-specific topology by introducing swap gates and basis gates, and applying optimizations that reduce circuit depth and gate count, particularly for two-qubit gates. As the number of qubits increases, the cost of transpilation escalates significantly, especially when trying to find the optimal layout with minimal noise under the qubit connectivity constraints imposed by device topology. In this work, we use the Rivet transpiler, which accelerates transpilation by reusing previously transpiled circuits. This approach is relevant for cases such as quantum chemistry, where multiple Pauli terms need to be measured by appending a series of rotation gates at the end for non-commuting Paulis, and for more complex cases when quantum circuits need to be modified iteratively, as occurs in quantum layerwise learning. We demonstrate up to 600% improvement in transpilation time for quantum layerwise learning using the Rivet transpiler compared to standard transpilation without reuse.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a key component in many quantum algorithms. In particular, the problem of sparse QSP (SQSP) $\unicode{x2013}$ the task of preparing the states with only a small number of non-zero amplitudes $\unicode{x2013}$ has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this work, we focus on reducing the circuit depth of SQSP with limited number of ancilla qubits. We present two SQSP algorithms: one with depth $O(n\log d)$, and another that reduces depth to $O(n)$. The latter leverages mid-circuit measurement and feedforward, where intermediate measurement outcomes are used to control subsequent quantum operations. Both constructions have size $O(dn)$ and use $O(d)$ ancilla qubits. Compared to the state-of-the-art SQSP algorithm in arXiv:2108.06150, which allows an arbitrary number of ancilla qubits $m&gt;0$, both of our algorithms achieve lower circuit depth when $m=d$.</description>

      <title>$k$-Positive Maps: New Characterizations and a Generation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $k$-positive linear maps on matrix algebras and address two problems, (i) characterizations of $k$-positivity and (ii) generation of non-decomposable $k$-positive maps. On the characterization side, we derive optimization-based conditions equivalent to $k$-positivity that (a) reduce to a simple check when $k=d$, (b) reveal a direct link to the spectral norm of certain order-3 tensors (aligning with known NP-hardness barriers for $k&lt;d$), and (c) recast $k$-positivity as a novel optimization problem over separable states, thereby connecting it explicitly to separability testing. On the generation side, we introduce a Lie-semigroup-based method that, starting from a single $k$-positive map, produces one-parameter families that remain $k$-positive and non-decomposable for small enough times. We illustrate this by generating such families for $d=3$ and $d=4$. We also formulate a semi-definite program (SDP) to test an equivalent form of the positive partial transpose (PPT) square conjecture (and do not find any violation of the latter). Our results provide practical computational tools for certifying $k$-positivity and a systematic way to sample $k$-positive non-decomposable maps.</description>

      <title>QUAV: Quantum-Assisted Path Planning and Optimization for UAV Navigation with Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for drone navigation in urban and restricted airspaces requires real-time path planning that is both safe and scalable. Classical methods often struggle with the computational load of high-dimensional optimization under dynamic constraints like obstacle avoidance and no-fly zones. This work introduces QUAV, a quantum-assisted UAV path planning framework based on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first applications of QAOA for drone trajectory optimization. QUAV models pathfinding as a quantum optimization problem, allowing efficient exploration of multiple paths while incorporating obstacle constraints and geospatial accuracy through UTM coordinate transformation. A theoretical analysis shows that QUAV achieves linear scaling in circuit depth relative to the number of edges, under fixed optimization settings. Extensive simulations and a real-hardware implementation on IBM's ibm_kyiv backend validate its performance and robustness under noise. Despite hardware constraints, results demonstrate that QUAV generates feasible, efficient trajectories, highlighting the promise of quantum approaches for future drone navigation systems.</description>

      <title>CircuitHunt: Automated Quantum Circuit Screening for Superior Credit-Card Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing effective quantum models for real-world tasks remains a key challenge within Quantum Machine Learning (QML), particularly in applications such as credit card fraud detection, where extreme class imbalance and evolving attack patterns demand both accuracy and adaptability. Most existing approaches rely on either manually designed or randomly initialized circuits, leading to high failure rates and limited scalability. In this work, we introduce CircuitHunt, a fully automated quantum circuit screening framework that streamlines the discovery of high-performing models. CircuitHunt filters circuits from the KetGPT dataset using qubit and parameter constraints, embeds each candidate into a standardized hybrid QNN, and performs rapid training with checkpointing based on macro-F1 scores to discard weak performers early. The top-ranked circuit is then fully trained, achieving 97% test accuracy and a high macro-F1 score on a challenging fraud detection benchmark. By combining budget-aware pruning, empirical evaluation, and end-to-end automation, CircuitHunt reduces architecture search time from days to hours while maintaining performance. It thus provides a scalable and task-driven tool for QML deployment in critical financial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from quantum data presents new challenges to the paradigm of learning from data. This typically entails the use of quantum learning models to learn quantum processes that come with enough subtleties to modify the theoretical learning frameworks. This new intersection warrants new frameworks for complexity measures, including those on quantum sample complexity and generalization bounds. Empirical risk minimization (ERM) serves as the foundational framework for evaluating learning models in general. The diversity of learning problems leads to the development of advanced learning strategies such as tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM). Theoretical aspects of quantum learning under a quantum ERM framework are presented in [PRX Quantum 5, 020367 (2024)]. In this work, we propose a definition for TERM suitable to be employed when learning quantum processes, which gives rise to quantum TERM (QTERM). We show that QTERM can be viewed as a competitive alternative to implicit and explicit regularization strategies for quantum process learning. This work contributes to the existing literature on quantum and classical learning theory threefold. First, we prove QTERM learnability by deriving upper bounds on QTERM's sample complexity. Second, we establish new PAC generalization bounds on classical TERM. Third, we present QTERM agnostic learning guarantees for quantum hypothesis selection. These results contribute to the broader literature of complexity bounds on the feasibility of learning quantum processes, as well as methods for improving generalization in quantum learning.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Linear Measurements in Cavity Optomechanics: Examples and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed understanding of physical measurements is essential for devising efficient metrological strategies and measurement-feedback schemes, as well as finding fundamental limitations on measurement sensitivity. In the quantum regime, measurements modify the state of the system of interest through measurement backaction as a direct consequence of the Heisenberg principle. In cavity optomechanics and electromechanics, a plethora of strategies exist for measuring the mechanical motion using electromagnetic fields, each leading to different competition between measurement imprecision and backaction. While this range of techniques allows broad applications of optomechanical and electromechanical devices, it makes direct comparison of different measurement methods difficult. We develop a formalism for quantifying the performance of optomechanical measurements using a few relevant figures of merit. Our approach is inspired by similar characterizations in quantum optics and quantifies the main properties of quantum measurements -- the ability to distinguish different quantum states and preservation of signal in the presence of measurement noise. We demonstrate our concept on the most common optomechanical measurements -- displacement detection, coherent quantum noise cancellation, and quantum nondemolition measurements -- and perform detailed analysis of errors in optomechanical nondemolition measurements. This newly acquired knowledge allows us to propose a strategy for quantum nondemolition measurements in levitodynamics using coherent scattering. Our results complement existing knowledge of linear optomechanical interactions and open the way to new understanding of optomechanical measurements, thus allowing also novel applications of optomechanical devices in fundamental physics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Computationally Tractable Offline Quantum Experimental Design for Nuclear Spin Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of nuclear spin environments in solid-state devices plays an important role in advancing quantum technologies, yet traditional methods often demand long measurement times. To address this challenge, we extend our recently developed deep-learning-based SALI model (Signal-to-image ArtificiaL Intelligence) by introducing the surrogate information gain (SIG) to optimize the selection of data points in the measurements. This approach significantly reduces time requirements in experiments while preserving accuracy in nuclear spin detection. The SIG is a figure of merit based on the expected variance of the signal, which is more straightforward to compute than the expected information gain rooted in Bayesian estimation. We demonstrate our approach on a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond coupled to $^{13}$C nuclei. In the high-field regime, our variance-based optimization is validated with experimental data, resulting in an 85$\%$ reduction in measurement time for a modest reduction in performance. This work also constitutes the first validation of SALI on experimental data. In the low-field regime, we explore its performance on simulated data, predicting a 60$\%$ reduction in the total experiment time by improving the temporal resolution of the measurements and applying SIG. This demonstrates the potential of integrating deep learning with optimized signal selection to enhance the efficiency of quantum sensing and nuclear spin characterization, paving the way for scaling these techniques to larger nuclear spin systems.</description>

      <title>Realization of an untrusted intermediate relay architecture using a quantum dot single-photon source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fully exploit the potential of quantum technologies, quantum networks are needed to link different systems, significantly enhancing applications in computing, cryptography, and metrology. Central to these networks are quantum relays that can facilitate long-distance entanglement distribution and quantum communication. In this work, we present a modular and scalable quantum relay architecture using a high-quality single-photon source. The proposed network incorporates three untrusted intermediate nodes and is capable of a repetition rate of 304.52 MHz. We use a measurement-device-independent protocol to demonstrate secure key establishment over fibers covering up to 300 kilometers. This study highlights the potential of single-photon sources in quantum relays to enhance information transmission, expand network coverage, and improve deployment flexibility, with promising applications in future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Phase error estimation for passive detection setups with imperfections and memory effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generic framework to bound the phase error rate for quantum key distribution protocols using passive detection setups with imperfections and memory effects. This framework can be used in proof techniques based on the entropic uncertainty relation or phase error correction, to prove security in the finite-size regime against coherent attacks. Our framework can incorporate on-the-fly announcements of click/no-click outcomes on Bob's side. In the case of imperfections without memory effects, it can be combined with proofs addressing source imperfections in a modular manner. We apply our framework to compute key rates for the decoy-state BB84 protocol, when the beam splitting ratio, the detection efficiency, and dark counts of the detectors are only known to be within some ranges. We also compute key rates in the presence of memory effects in the detectors. In this case, our results allow for protocols to be run at higher repetition rates, resulting in a significant improvement in the secure key generation rate.</description>

      <title>Statistical Invisibility of a Physical Attack on QRNGs After Randomness Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current prevailing designs of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) designs typically employ post-processing techniques to distill raw random data, followed by statistical verification with suites like NIST SP 800-22. This paper demonstrates that this widely adopted practice harbors a critical flaw. We show that the powerful extraction process can create a false sense of security by perfectly concealing physical-layer attacks, rendering the subsequent statistical tests blind to a compromised entropy source. We substantiate this claim across two major QRNG architectures. Experimentally, we severely compromise an QRNG based on amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with a power supply ripple attack. While the resulting raw data catastrophically fails NIST tests, a standard Toeplitz extraction transforms it into a final sequence that passes flawlessly. This outcome highlights a profound danger: since the validation process is insensitive to the quality of the raw data, it implies that even a fully predictable input could be processed to produce a certified, yet completely insecure, random sequence. Our theoretical analysis confirms this vulnerability extends to phase-noise-based QRNGs, suggesting a need for security validation to evolve beyond statistical analysis of the final output and consider the entire generation process.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of many-body systems: Making the most of intermediate-scale, noisy quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical problems are among the hardest to simulate and, in some cases, remain intractable even for the most powerful computers. Quantum computing has emerged as a new technological platform to address such challenges, with rapid advances in recent years. Yet, current quantum devices remain noisy and limited in scale. Hence, it is essential to identify classically hard problems of practical interest and tractable with existing quantum devices. Among potential applications, the real-time simulation of quantum systems is one of the most promising to deliver an early, practical quantum advantage. This doctoral thesis is therefore centered around simulating quantum dynamics on quantum devices. We first present an overview of the most relevant quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics, highlighting respective advantages and limitations. Further, we identify relevant problems within quantum dynamics that could benefit from quantum simulation in the near future. Second, we propose a method for benchmarking hardware and error mitigation algorithms that is based on well-understood theoretical results and suffers from no scaling issues. The resulting quality metric is intuitive and transferable to other applications. We successfully implement the scheme on up to 133 qubits, demonstrating coherent evolution up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. Third, we propose a novel variant of probabilistic error amplification to implement open quantum dynamics, relying on characterizing and altering hardware noise to mimic the system-environment interaction under study. Lastly, we present two studies on state preparation and phase classification: first, a hybrid algorithm to prepare ground states of electron-phonon systems; second, a quantum machine learning-based approach to distinguish phases in previously prepared quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a theory of light transmission through a Zero-Mode Waveguide (ZMW) containing a single atom. It is shown that the presence of a single atom inside the ZMW can lead to either a significant enhancement or suppression of light transmission, depending on the detuning of the excitation field frequency from the atomic resonance. This extraordinary transmission and blocking effect can be employed for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of atoms in complex nanoscopic environments, probing quantum optical phenomena, and developing novel nano-optical devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an in-depth review of the evolving role of quantum computing in the financial sector, emphasizing both its computational potential and cybersecurity implications. Distinguishing itself from existing surveys, this work integrates classical quantum computing applications - such as portfolio optimization, risk analysis, derivative pricing, and Monte Carlo simulations with a thorough examination of blockchain technologies and post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which are crucial for maintaining secure financial operations in the emerging quantum era. We propose a structured four-step framework to assess the feasibility and expected benefits of implementing quantum solutions in finance, considering factors such as computational scalability, error tolerance, data complexity, and practical implementability. This framework is applied to a series of representative financial scenarios to identify domains where quantum approaches can surpass classical techniques. Furthermore, the paper explores the vulnerabilities quantum computing introduces to digital finance-related applications and blockchain security, including risks to digital signatures, hash functions, and randomness generation, and discusses mitigation strategies through PQC and quantum-resilient alternatives of classical digital finance tools and blockchain architectures. By addressing both quantum blockchain, quantum key distribution (QKD) as well as quantum communication networks, his review presents a more holistic perspective than prior studies, offering actionable insights for researchers, financial practitioners, and policymakers navigating the intersection of quantum computing, blockchain, and secure financial systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Precision Limits in General Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intuition that the precision of observables is constrained by thermodynamic costs has recently been formalized through thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. While such trade-offs have been extensively studied in Markovian systems, corresponding constraints in the non-Markovian regime remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we derive universal bounds on the precision of generic observables in open quantum systems coupled to environments of arbitrary strength and subjected to two-point measurements. By introducing an asymmetry term that quantifies the disparity between forward and backward processes, we show that the relative fluctuation of any time-antisymmetric current is constrained by both entropy production and this forward-backward asymmetry. For general observables, we prove that their relative fluctuation is always bounded from below by a generalized activity term. These results establish a comprehensive framework for understanding precision limits in broad classes of general open quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the entanglement between electronic and nuclear motions in molecular wave functions, by using different widely used ansatzes in molecular Hamiltonian models (H$^+_2$ in 1D and the Shin-Metiu model); namely, i) Born-Oppenheimer separation in both adiabatic and ii) diabatic pictures and beyond it, iii) using a Born-Huang expansion, which involves non-adiabatic couplings in the solution. Any molecule can be considered a bipartite system in terms of electronic and nuclear halfspaces. Accordingly, the Schmidt decomposition theorem can be applied to each molecular ansatz to find a much shorter representation in terms of Schmidt basis and to estimate the entanglement content through the calculation of von Neumann entropies. Although here we justify that the ground BO vibronic state of any molecule may be regarded as an almost separable and non-entangled state, this property worsens with the vibrational excitation, which increases the entanglement monotonically. The interlace between electronic and nuclear wave functions for each vibronic state becomes even more critical for those electronic excited states whose electronic wave functions change drastically with the molecular geometry. We find that the entanglement may be quantified by the variation of the electronic wave function along the different nuclear geometries, and that the nuclear wave function indeed plays the role of a tester. In addition, the presence of avoided crossings among the potential energy curves brings about a strong enhancement of entanglement in the Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic picture, which instead is much reduced in a diabatic picture. Finally, the Born-Huang expansion uncovers some synergistic vibronic states whose entanglement content is larger than that of any Born-Oppenheimer component in the superposition.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sequential Universal Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) concerns the statistical inference of unknown quantum states. In the general setting of composite hypotheses, the goal of QHT is to determine whether an unknown quantum state belongs to one or another of two classes of states based on the measurement of a number of copies of the state. Prior art on QHT with composite hypotheses focused on a fixed-copy two-step protocol, with state estimation followed by an optimized joint measurement. However, this fixed-copy approach may be inefficient, using the same number of copies irrespective of the inherent difficulty of the testing task. To address these limitations, we introduce the quantum sequential universal test (QSUT), a novel framework for sequential QHT in the general case of composite hypotheses. QSUT builds on universal inference, and it alternates between adaptive local measurements aimed at exploring the hypothesis space and joint measurements optimized for maximal discrimination. QSUT is proven to rigorously control the type I error under minimal assumptions about the hypothesis structure. We present two practical instantiations of QSUT, one based on the Helstrom-Holevo test and one leveraging shallow variational quantum circuits. Empirical results across a range of composite QHT tasks demonstrate that QSUT consistently reduces copy complexity relative to state-of-the-art fixed-copy strategies.</description>

      <title>Impurities in cryogenic solids: a new platform for hybrid quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems offer a promising platform for studying quantum phenomena and developing applied technologies, benefiting from the individual strengths of their components. Here, we present a novel hybrid quantum platform composed of solid noble gas crystals doped with spin impurities atop superconducting resonators. The noble gas crystals provide a soft, inert, predominantly spin-0 host matrix for the atomic impurities, while the alkali atoms have addressable and long-lived hyperfine transitions in the GHz regime. We demonstrate the ability to reach the strong coupling regime between the atomic impurity ensemble and the superconducting resonator at mK temperatures, and perform coherence time measurements. Our proof-of-principle measurements show that this platform offers a unique architecture for exploring fundamental quantum effects and new quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Block Encoding of Sparse Matrices via Coherent Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block encoding of sparse matrices underpins powerful quantum algorithms such as quantum singular value transformation, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum linear solvers, but its efficient gate-level implementation for arbitrary sparse matrices remains a major challenge. We introduce a unified framework that overcomes the key obstacles of multi-controlled X gates overhead, amplitude reordering, and hardware connectivity, enabling efficient block encoding for arbitrary sparse matrices with explicit gate-level constructions. Central to our approach are a novel connection with combinatorial optimization, which enables systematic assignment of control qubits to achieve nearest-neighbor connectivity, and coherent permutation operators that preserve superposition while enabling amplitude reordering. We demonstrate our methods on structured sparse matrices, showing significant reductions in circuit depth and control overhead, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical formulations and practical circuit implementations for quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>A simple method for seniority-zero quantum state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), the quantum algorithm for estimating eigenvalues of a given Hermitian matrix and preparing its eigenvectors, is considered the most promising approach to finding the ground states and their energies of electronic systems using a quantum computer. It requires, however, to be warm--started from an initial state with sufficiently high overlap with the ground state. For strongly-correlated states, where QPE is expected to have advantage over classical methods, preparation of such initial states requires deep quantum circuits and/or expensive hybrid quantum-classical optimization. It is well-known that orbital-optimized paired Coupled Cluster Doubles (oo-pCCD) method can describe the static correlation features of many strongly correlated singlet states. We show that pCCD and its unitary counterpart, UpCCD, become equivalent in the limit of small amplitudes if the amplitude matrix is sufficiently sparse. We demonstrate that substituting leading oo-pCCD amplitudes into the UpCCD Ansatz allows to prepare high-fidelity singlet states for models of multiple-bond dissociation in ethene, ethyne and dinitrogen, as well as for 1D Hubbard models at half-filling, with very shallow circuits. We envisage our method to be of general use for approximate preparation of singlet states for Quantum Phase Estimation and related algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Exclusive-Sum-of-Products Pipeline for QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm is commonly used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. While unconstrained problems map naturally into the algorithm, incorporating constraints typically requires penalizing constraint violations in the objective function. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that encodes constraints as Boolean expressions in exclusive-sum-of-products (ESOP) form before penalization. We test this method on the maximum independent set problem using graphs with 3 to 20 vertices and find that ESOP constraint formulations achieve higher approximation ratios than standard constraint penalization methods, with percent increases of up to 30.3%. Furthermore, ESOP constraint formulations result in higher approximation ratios than standard QAOA penalization approaches after one layer of the algorithm on approximately 64% of the tested graphs.</description>

      <title>An Exact Branch and Bound Algorithm for the generalized Qubit Mapping Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits are typically represented by a (ordered) sequence of gates over a set of virtual qubits. During compilation, the virtual qubits of the gates are assigned to the physical qubits of the underlying quantum hardware, a step often referred to as the qubit assignment problem. To ensure that the resulting circuit respects hardware connectivity constraints, additional SWAP gates are inserted as needed, which is known as the qubit routing problem. Together, they are called the Qubit Mapping Problem (QMP), which is known to be NP-hard. A very common way to deal with the complexity of the QMP is to partition the sequence of gates into a sequence of gate groups (or layers). However, this imposes a couple of important restrictions: (1) SWAP gates can only be added between pairs of consecutive groups, and (2) all the gates belonging to a certain group have to be executed (in parallel) in the same time slot. The first one prevents gates to be re-arranged optimally, while the second one imposes a time discretization that practically ignores gate execution time. While this clearly reduces the size of the feasible space, little is still known about how much is actually lost by imposing a fixed layering when looking at the minimization of either the number of SWAPs or the makespan of the compiled circuit. In this paper, we present a flexible branch and bound algorithm for a generalized version of the QMP that either considers or ignores the gate layering and the gate execution time. The algorithm can find find proven optimal solutions for all variations of the QMP, but also offers a great platform for different heuristic algorithms. We present results on several benchmark sets of small quantum circuits, and we show how ignoring the layering can significantly improve some key performance indicators of the compiled circuit.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Reasoning with Control as a Constructor, Applications to Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control is a predominant concept in quantum and reversible computational models. It allows to apply or not a transformation on a system, depending on the state of another system. We introduce a general framework for diagrammatic reasoning featuring control as a constructor. To do so, we provide an elementary axiomatisation of control functors, extending the standard formalism of props (symmetric monoidal categories with the natural numbers as objects) to controlled props. As an application, we show that controlled props ease diagrammatic reasoning for quantum circuits by allowing a simple complete set of relations that only involves relations acting on at most three qubits, whereas it is known that in the standard prop setting any complete axiomatisation requires relations acting on arbitrarily many qubits.</description>

      <title>On the Implementation Security of Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution using Optical Injection Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) has emerged as a leading quantum communication protocol, enabling secure key distribution over unprecedented distances by utilising coherent interference of quantum states. Optical Injection Locking (OIL) architectures have been used to simplify the precise phase and frequency stabilisation required by TF-QKD. In this work, we systematically analyse potential side-channels in OIL-based TF-QKD that can be introduced through the various optical degrees of freedom of the externally injected reference laser. We experimentally demonstrate two realistic attack scenarios: rapid intensity modulation of the reference laser and Trojan-horse signals exploiting wavelengths undetectable by conventional monitoring techniques. To counter these vulnerabilities, we propose straightforward and highly effective countermeasures including high-speed photodiodes for real-time power monitoring and targeted spectral filtering to detect and suppress out-of-band signals. Our experimental results confirm that these practical solutions substantially reinforce the security of TF-QKD systems without significant additional complexity or performance degradation. More broadly, our analysis highlights the critical importance of comprehensive optical monitoring to ensure the robust practical deployment of TF-QKD in real-world quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Sensitivity with Generalized Coherent States Based on Deformed su(1,1) and Heisenberg Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase sensitivity of a Mach Zehnder interferometer using a special class of generalized coherent states constructed from generalized Heisenberg and deformed su(1,1) algebras. These states, derived from a perturbed harmonic oscillator with a four parameter deformed spectrum, provide enhanced tunability and nonclassical features. The quantum Fisher information and its associated quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound are used to define the fundamental precision limits in phase estimation. We analyze the phase sensitivity under three realistic detection methods: difference intensity detection, single mode intensity detection, and balanced homodyne detection. The performance of each method is compared with the quantum Cram\'er Rao bound to evaluate their optimality. Our results demonstrate that, for suitable parameter regimes, these generalized coherent states enable phase sensitivities approaching the quantum limit, offering a flexible framework for precision quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant quantum emitters, whose effective size is comparable to the wavelength of the radiation they couple to, give rise to interference effects and non-Markovian dynamics that lie beyond the scope of the standard Weisskopf-Wigner approximation. Here we study minimal models of giant emitters coupled to cavit$-array waveguides and identify symmetric configurations where the dynamics can be solved exactly. This allows us to capture the emergence of bound states both inside and outside the photonic continuum, and to demonstrate the possibility of engineering their coherent superpositions. Our results provide analytical insight into non-Markovian light-matter interaction and suggest a feasible implementation using superconducting circuit platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical First-Passage-Time Distributions (FPTDs) have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. Their quantum counterparts, Quantum First-Passage-Time Distributions (QFPTDs), remain largely unexplored and have deep implications for both fundamental physics and the development of emerging quantum technologies. We measure the first QFPTDs using a motional mode of a single trapped ion. We develop a novel composite-phase laser pulse sequence to perform tunable stroboscopic projective measurements of the motional state of a trapped ion. We measure QFPTDs of the ion energy when coupled to electric-field noise and establish a clear connection with its classical counterpart. The measurement protocol developed here is broadly applicable to other quantum systems and provides a powerful method for exploring a broad range of QFPTD phenomena. With these results we open a new field of experimental investigations of QFPT processes with potential future relevance to quantum search algorithms, unraveling connections between classical and quantum dynamics, and study of the quantum measurement problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-based Quantum Computation(MBQC) utilize entanglement as resource for performing quantum computation. Generating cluster state using entanglement as resource is a key bottleneck for the adoption of MBQC. To generate cluster state with charge-qubit arrrays, we provide analytical derivations and numerical validations for 4-qubit cluster state. We compare our fidelities under ideal (noise-free) Hamiltonian evolution and due to effect of decoherence. We show incorporating energy relaxation ($T_1$) yields $&gt;$90\% fidelity while pure dephasing $T_2$ show $70\%$ decays at fourth harmonics. We further show under noise $T_2$ decays to 50\% within 15 time units, versus $&gt;$70\% under relaxation time units ($T_1$)--only. This decay quantify degradation effect of $T_2$ on preparing cluster--state preparation is more than $T_1$. We highlight the critical need for targeted error-mitigation strategies in near-term MBQC implementations.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a recent progress concerning quantum commuting and quantum tensor models of composed systems we investigate a notion of (generalized) unitary induced quantum channel. Using properties of Brown algebras we provide an equivalent characterization of discussed families in both tensor and commuting paradigms. In particular, we provide an equivalent formulation of Tsirelson's conjecture (Connes' embedding problem) in terms of considered paradigms based on protocols which do not require measurements performed on infinite-dimensional subsystems. As a result we show that there is a difference between quantum commuting and quantum tensor models for generalized unitary induced channels.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired probability metrics define a complete, universal space for statistical learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural, social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes ($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold atoms in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain moire quasicrystal patterns via Floquet-engineering intralayer-atomic interactions in twisted bilayer hexagonal optical lattices of ultracold atoms. By tracking the density wave amplitude, we partition the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes of each stage in both real and momentum space. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is intimately tied to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude will facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Most notably, at specific parameters, a twelve-fold (D12) moire quasicrystal pattern emerges which closely resembles that observed in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space patterns likewise exhibit pronounced rotational symmetry, with those in real space showing good agreement at specific instants. The patterns obtained exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting that this frequency-dependent pattern formation could be exploited for quantum precision measurement. Our findings introduce a new paradigm for investigating the quasicrystals and their associated symmetries in ultracold atomic system.</description>

      <title>Finite entropy sums in quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropies associated with spatial subsystems in conventional local quantum field theories are typically divergent when the spatial regions have boundaries. However, in certain linear combinations of the entropies for various subsystems, these divergences may cancel, giving finite quantities that provide information-theoretic data about the underlying state. In this note, we show that all such quantities can be written as linear combinations of three basic types of quantities: i) the entropy of a spatial subsystem minus the entropy of its complementary subsystem, ii) the mutual information between non-adjacent subsystems, and iii) the tripartite information for triples of disjoint sub-systems. For a fixed decomposition of a spatial slice into regions, we describe a basis of sums of entropies for collections of for these regions for which all divergences related to both region boundaries and higher-codimension intersections of regions cancel. Key mathematical technology used in this work (Fourier transforms on the Boolean cube and M\"obius transformations of functions on partially ordered sets) and several of the main proof ideas were suggested by AI (ChatGPT5). We offer a few comments on the use of AI in physics and mathematics, based on our experience.</description>

      <title>Project-Based Learning in Introductory Quantum Computing Courses: A Case Study on Quantum Algorithms for Medical Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing introduces abstract concepts and non-intuitive behaviors that can be challenging for students to grasp through traditional lecture-based instruction alone. This paper demonstrates how Project-Based Learning (PBL) can be leveraged to bridge that gap. This can be done by engaging students in a real-world, interdisciplinary task that combines quantum computing with their field of interest. As part of a similar assignment, we investigated the application of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and benchmarked its performance against the classical Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). Through implementing and analyzing both methods on a small-scale problem, we gained practical experience with quantum algorithms, critically evaluated their limitations, and developed technical writing and research skills. The experience demonstrated that Project-Based Learning not only enhances conceptual understanding but also encourages students to engage deeply with emerging technologies through research, implementation, and reflection. We recommend the integration of similar PBL modules in introductory quantum computing courses. The assignment also works better if students are required to write and submit a conference-style paper, supported by mentorship from faculty across the different fields. In such course interdisciplinary, real-world problems can transform abstract theory into meaningful learning experiences and better prepare students for future advancements in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Simulations of Graphene Analogues: Adsorption Energetics Beyond DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding strongly correlated systems is essential for advancing quantum chemistry and materials science, yet conventional methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) often fail to capture their complex electronic behavior. To address these limitations, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates Multiconfigurational Self Consistent Field (MCSCF) with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our initial benchmarks on water dissociation enabled the systematic optimization of key computational parameters, including ansatz selection, active space construction, and error mitigation. Building on this, we extend our approach to investigate the interactions between graphene analogues and water, demonstrating that our framework produces binding energies consistent with high accuracy quantum methods. Furthermore, we apply this methodology to predict the binding energies of transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) on both pristine and defective graphene analogues, revealing strong charge transfer effects and pronounced multireference character phenomena often misrepresented by standard DFT. In contrast to many existing quantum algorithms that are constrained to small molecular systems, our framework achieves chemically accurate predictions for larger, strongly correlated systems such as metal graphene complexes. This advancement highlights the capacity of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to address complex electronic interactions and demonstrates a practical route toward realizing quantum advantage for real world materials applications in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description>

Abstract: We provide an exact evaluation of the out-of-time correlation (OTOC) functions for the localized $f$-particle states in the Falicov-Kimball model within dynamical mean-field theory. Different regimes of quantum chaos and quantum scrambling are distinguished by the winding numbers of the block Toeplitz matrices used in the calculation. The similarities of these fermionic OTOCs and their Lyapunov exponents for time evolution with the OTOCs for quantum spin models with disorder are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP) are essential tools for implementing the block encoding of matrix functions. The achievable polynomials of QSP have restrictions on parity, while GQSP eliminates these restrictions. In this paper, we further investigate GQSP and present a quantum bi-conjugate gradient (BiCG) algorithm as an application. First, we extend GQSP, which constructs functions of unitary matrices, to general matrices. We refer to this extension as generalized quantum singular value transformation (GQSVT). Subsequently, we implement the quantum BiCG method, utilizing GQSVT and swap test, which has a relatively shallow circuit depth and requires a small number of ancilla qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced ensemble GANs for anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of the Dirac equation from a stochastic master equation suggests a profound link between relativistic quantum mechanics and underlying probabilistic descriptions of brain dynamics. In parallel, recent work has shown that the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations describing excitable neurons can be reformulated to yield a Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation with a novel Planck-like constant, indicating that neural noise may give rise to quantum-like dynamics. This paper brings these insights together to propose two novel neuroscience experiments aimed at detecting emergent coherence in axonal signal propagation and subthreshold oscillations. We suggest that stochastic interference effects in axon branching structures may reveal signatures of Dirac-type stochasticity. We also suggest that by measuring neuronal temperature and fluctuations we can detect quantum effects in brain oscillations. If successful, these experiments will provide experimental support for quantum markers of brain processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe relativistic particles with spin as points moving in phase space $X=T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$, where $T^* R^{1,3}=R^{1,3}\times R^{1,3}$ is the space of coordinates and momenta, and $C^2_L$ and $C^2_R$ are the spaces of representation of the Lorentz group of type $(\frac12 , 0)$ and $(0, \frac12)$. Passing from relativistic mechanics with a Lorentz-invariant Hamiltonian function $H$ on the phase space $X$ to quantum mechanics with a Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$, we introduce two complex conjugate line bundles $L_C^+$ and $L_C^-$ over $X$. Quantum particles are introduced as sections $\Psi_+$ of the bundle $L_C^+$ holomorphic along the space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$, and antiparticles are sections $\Psi_-^{}$ of the bundle $L_C^-$ antiholomorphic along the internal spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are characterized by conserved charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ associated with the structure group U(1)$_{\sf{v}}$ of the bundles $L_C^\pm$. Wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are governed by relativistic analogue of the Schr\"odinger equation. We show how fields with spin $s=0$ (Klein-Gordon), spin $s=\frac12$ (Dirac) and spin $s=1$ (Proca fields) arise from these equations in the zeroth, first, and second order expansions of the functions $\Psi_\pm^{}$ in the coordinates of the spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Proca equations for these fields follow from the Schr\"odinger equation on the extended phase space $T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$. Using these results, we also introduce equations describing first quantized photons. We show that taking into account the charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ of the fields $\Psi_\pm$ changes the definitions of the inner products and currents, which eliminates negative energies and negative probabilities from relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Observation of universal non-Gaussian statistics of the order parameter across a continuous phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order phase transitions are characterised by critical scaling and universality. The singular behaviour of thermodynamic quantities at the transition, in particular, is determined by critical exponents of the universality class of the transition. However, critical properties are also characterised by the probability distribution of order parameter across the transition, where non-Gaussian statistics are expected, but remain largely unexplored. Here, making use of single-atom-resolved detection in momentum space, we measure the full probability distribution of the amplitude of the order parameter across a continuous phase transition in an interacting lattice Bose gas. We find that fluctuations are captured by an effective potential -- reconstructed from the measured probability distribution by analogy with Landau theory -- displaying a non-trivial minimum in the superfluid (ordered) phase, which vanishes at the transition point. Additionally, we observe non-Gaussian statistics of the order parameter near the transition, distinguished by non-zero and oscillating high-order cumulants. We provide direct experimental evidence that these oscillations are universal, and show numerically that they exhibit critical scaling. Our experiments are conducted in inhomogeneous systems, challenging the conventional understanding of criticality, which is primarily based on homogeneous models. Our results underscore the crucial role of order parameter statistics in probing critical phenomena and universality.</description>

      <title>Small $x$ behavior in QCD from maximal entanglement and conformal invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that, at small Bjorken $x$, QCD evolution drives the proton into a state of maximal entanglement. If the evolution kernel is assumed to be conformally invariant -- as is the case for the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) equation -- we can describe it by a conformal field theory. Moreover, the central charge $c$ of the corresponding conformal field theory emerges as the key parameter governing the $x$-dependence of both the entanglement entropy and the structure function. Here we apply the exact Bethe Ansatz methods to the quantum spin chain dual to Lipatov's high energy effective action to extract the central charge of the theory, and find that $c=1$. This implies the $\sim x^{-1/3}$ small $x$ behavior for the structure function -- the prediction that can be tested at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of path-entangled multi-photon NOON states in a flat-band photonic rhombic lattice and observe intriguing localization-delocalization features that depend on the phase as well as the photon number of the NOON states. To experimentally emulate photon number correlations, we develop an intensity correlation measurement protocol using coherent laser light with tunable relative phases. We first apply this protocol to show spatial bunching and anti-bunching of two-photon NOON states in a one-dimensional lattice consisting of identical waveguides. In the case of the rhombic lattice, we show that for an even (odd) photon number $N$, localization occurs at $0 \, (\pi)$ phase of the NOON state with a probability of $2^{1-N}$. Our results open an exciting route toward predicting quantum interference of correlated photons in complex photonic networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on Lin's breakthrough MIP$^{co}$ = coRE and an encoding of non-local games as universal sentences in the language of tracial von Neumann algebras, we show that locally universal tracial von Neumann algebras have undecidable universal theories. This implies that no such algebra admits a computable presentation. Our results also provide, for the first time, explicit examples of separable II$_1$ factors without computable presentations, and in fact yield a broad family of them, including McDuff factors, factors without property Gamma, and property (T) factors. We also obtain analogous results for locally universal semifinite von Neumann algebras and tracial C*-algebras. The latter provides strong evidence for a negative solution to the Kirchberg Embedding Problem. We discuss how these are obstructions to approximation properties in the class of tracial and semifinite von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>High fidelity flopping-mode single spin operation with tuning inter-dot orbital levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast spin manipulation and long spin coherence time in quantum dots are essential features for high fidelity semiconductor spin qubits. However, generally it has not been well established how to optimize these two properties simultaneously, because these two properties are usually not independent from each other. Therefore, the scheme for high fidelity operation by simultaneous tuning Rabi frequency and coherence time, which does not rely on the material-dependent strong spin-orbit interaction and the local magnetic field gradient limiting their scalability, are strongly demanded. Here, we demonstrate an approach to achieve high-fidelity spin control by tuning inter-dot spin-orbit coupling in a GaAs triple quantum dot (TQD), where the third dot provides precise control over orbital energy levels. In an electrically stable charge state with optimized tunnel coupling, we achieve Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz while maintaining coherence through proper tuning of the inter-dot orbital levels of the TQD. By implementing a machine learning-based feedback control that efficiently estimates qubit frequency using past measurement data, we characterize and mitigate the impact of low frequency noise on qubit coherence with minimal measurement overhead. Finally, we demonstrate a $\pi$/2 gate fidelity of 99.7\% with a gate time of 4 ns through randomized benchmarking, even in a GaAs quantum dot device where electron spin coherence is typically limited by strong hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. Our approach provides a scalable strategy for high-fidelity spin control in semiconductor quantum dot arrays by utilizing device-specific parameters rather than relying on material properties or external field gradients.</description>

Strong correlation in chemical systems are prevalent and present a formidable challenge in the simulation of these systems, while predictive phenomena in this domain often also requires a demanding level of accuracy to inform chemical behavior. Efficient representations of the many-electron states of chemical systems are therefore also being inspired by machine learning principles to provide an alternative to established approaches. In this chapter, we review recent progress in this endeavor for quantum chemical problems represented in second quantization, and the particular challenges present in this field. In particular, we focus on the application of Gaussian Process States emerging from efficient representations of the many-body wavefunction with rigorous Bayesian modeling frameworks, allowing for the unification of multiple paradigms under a common umbrella. We show how such models (and other representations derived from machine learning) can be used as novel tools to compute ab initio chemical properties, while in turn also informing the design of machine learning models to extract correlation patterns in classical data.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Anyon-Otto thermal machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a four-stroke quantum thermal machine based on the 1D anyon Hubbard model, which is capable of extracting the excess energy arising from anyon exclusion statistics at low temperature into finite work. Defining a hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low temperature work, in the absence of any interactions, is maximised in the pseudo fermionic limit, where the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or pseudo-fermionic extremes, but instead peaks at intermediate statistical angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions, in this regime. Furthermore, we also identify different modes of operation of the HAO cycle, one of which emerges as a direct consequence of the finite anyon energy at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Can a pure state remain pure in the Unruh effect?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.14712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A uniformly accelerated detector in an inertial vacuum undergoes an unavoidable dissipation, and the final steady-state becomes thermal. However, to attain such a mixed state, there is no bound for the acceleration of the single atomic detector. Here we show that the scenario is entirely different for two atoms with the same energy levels. There exists a critical limit of the acceleration for two atomic detectors, below which the purity of a particular initial state can be preserved. We observe that the generator of the dissipative dynamics (Lindbladian) is invariant under a weak symmetry transformation at this limit. Hence one of the eigenstates of the symmetry operator is unchanged during the evolution. This kind of state is called a quantum dark state, which is essentially a decoherence-free subspace. As a consequence, the system becomes localized, and it can skip the Unruh thermalization. Beyond the critical limit, the symmetry is explicitly broken. Therefore our results suggest that the system goes through a first-order dissipative phase transition from a localized to a thermal phase.</description>

      <title>Describing Trotterized Time Evolutions on Noisy Quantum Computers via Static Effective Lindbladians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the extent to which a Trotterized time evolution implemented on a quantum computer is altered by the presence of decoherence. Given a specific set of assumptions regarding the manner in which noise processes acting on such a device can be modeled at the circuit level, we show how the effects of noise can be reinterpreted as a shift to the dynamics of the original system being simulated. In particular, we find that this shift can be described through the use of static Lindblad noise terms, which act in addition to the original unitary dynamics. The form of these noise terms depends not only on the underlying noise processes occurring on the device, but also on the original unitary dynamics, as well as the manner in which these dynamics are simulated on the device, i.e., the choice of quantum algorithm. We call this effectively simulated open quantum system the noisy algorithm model. Our results are confirmed through numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Correlating Local Quantum Reality with Causally Disconnected Choices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09589v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) claimed the incompleteness of quantum mechanics based on the notions of realism (``{\it If, without in any way disrupting a system, we can predict with certainty - i.e., with a probability of one - the value of a physical quantity, then an element of physical reality corresponds to this physical quantity.}'') and locality (``{\it ...\,since the two systems no longer interact, no real change can take place in the second system in consequence of anything that may be done to the first system}''). EPR also insisted that ``{\it The elements of physical reality cannot be determined by \emph{a priori} philosophical considerations, but must be found by\,...\,experiments and measurements.}''. Here, employing an operational framework for testing realism in quantum systems, we envisage an experiment -- referred to as the Reality Quantum Correlator (RQC) -- capable of showing that the elements of reality in one laboratory can be correlated with causally disconnected choices, thus questioning EPR's locality. Empirical evidence supporting our theoretical predictions is then provided by implementing the corresponding quantum circuit on IBM's quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the ability of a controller to execute quantum error corrected non-Clifford circuits</title>

Abstract: Reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on the successful implementation of non-Clifford circuits with quantum error correction (QEC). In QEC, quantum gates and measurements encode quantum information into an error-protected Hilbert space, while classical processing decodes the measurements into logical errors. QEC non-Clifford gates pose the greatest computation challenge from the classical controller perspective, as they require mid-circuit decoding-dependent feed-forward, modifying the physical gate sequence based on the decoding outcome of previous measurements within the same circuit. In this work, we introduce the first benchmarks to holistically evaluate the capability of a combined controller-decoder system to run non-Clifford QEC circuits. We show that executing an error-corrected non-Clifford circuit, comprised of numerous non-Clifford gates, strictly hinges upon the classical controller-decoder system. Particularly, its ability to perform decoding-based feed-forward with low-latency, defined as the time between the last measurement required for decoding and the dependent mid-circuit quantum operation. We analyze how the system latency dictates the circuit operational regime: latency divergence, classical-controller-limited runtime, or quantum-operation-limited runtime. Based on this understanding, we introduce latency-based benchmarks to set a standard for developing QEC control systems as an essential components of fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Constrained and Vanishing Expressivity of Quantum Fourier Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we highlight an unforeseen behavior of the expressivity of Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) for machine learning. A large class of these models, seen as Fourier Series which frequencies are derived from the encoding gates, were thought to have their Fourier coefficients mostly determined by the trainable gates. Here, we demonstrate a new correlation between the Fourier coefficients of the quantum model and its encoding gates. In addition, we display a phenomenon of vanishing expressivity in certain settings, where some Fourier coefficients vanish exponentially when the number of qubits grows. These two behaviors imply novel forms of constraints which limit the expressivity of PQCs, and therefore imply a new inductive bias for Quantum models. The key concept in this work is the notion of a frequency redundancy in the Fourier series spectrum, which determines its importance. Those theoretical behaviours are observed in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Lie algebraic invariants in quantum linear optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum linear optics without post-selection is not powerful enough to produce any quantum state from a given input state. This limits its utility since some applications require entangled resources that are difficult to prepare. Thus, we need a deeper understanding of linear optical state preparation. In this work, we give a recipe to derive conserved quantities in the evolution of arbitrary states along any possible passive linear interferometer. One example of such an invariant is the projection of a density operator onto the Lie algebra of passive linear optical Hamiltonians. These invariants give necessary conditions for exact state preparation: if the input and output states have different invariants, it is impossible to design a passive linear interferometer that evolves one into the other. Moreover, we provide a lower bound to the distance between an output and target state based on the distance between their invariants. This gives a necessary condition for approximate or heralded state preparations. Therefore, the invariants allow us to narrow the search when trying to prepare useful entangled states, like NOON states, from easy-to-prepare states, like Fock states. We conclude that future exact and approximate state preparation methods will need to consider the necessary conditions given by our invariants to weed out impossible linear optical evolutions.</description>

      <title>Efficient fault-tolerant code switching via one-way transversal CNOT gates</title>

Abstract: Code switching is an established technique that facilitates a universal set of FT quantum gate operations by combining two QEC codes with complementary sets of gates, which each by themselves are easy to implement fault-tolerantly. In this work, we present a code switching scheme that respects the constraints of FT circuit design by only making use of transversal gates. These gates are intrinsically FT without additional qubit overhead. We analyze application of the scheme to low-distance color codes, which are suitable for operation in existing quantum processors, for instance based on trapped ions or neutral atoms. We briefly discuss connectivity constraints that arise for architectures based on superconducting qubits. Numerical simulations of circuit-level noise indicate that a logical $T$-gate, facilitated by our scheme, could outperform both flag-FT magic state injection protocols and a physical $T$-gate at low physical error rates. Transversal code switching naturally scales to code pairs of arbitrary code distance. We observe improved performance of a distance-5 protocol compared to both the distance-3 implementation and the physical gate for realistically attainable physical entangling gate error rates. We discuss how the scheme can be implemented with a large degree of parallelization, provided that logical auxiliary qubits can be prepared reliably enough. Our logical $T$-gate circumvents potentially costly magic state factories. The requirements to perform QEC and to achieve an FT universal gate set are then essentially the same: Prepare logical auxiliary qubits offline, execute transversal gates and perform fast-enough measurements. Transversal code switching thus serves to enable more practical hardware realizations of FT universal quantum computation. The scheme alleviates resource requirements for experimental demonstrations of quantum algorithms run on logical qubits.</description>

Abstract: In quantum information processing, a tension between two different tasks occurs: while qubits' states can be preserved by isolating them, quantum gates can be realized only through qubit-qubit interactions. In arrays of qubits, weak coupling leads to states being spatially localized and strong coupling to delocalized states. Here, we study the average energy level spacing and the relative entropy of the distribution of the level spacings (Kullback-Leibler divergence from Poisson and Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble) to analyze the crossover between localized and delocalized (chaotic) regimes in linear arrays of superconducting qubits. We consider both transmons as well as capacitively shunted flux qubits, which enables us to tune the qubit anharmonicity. Arrays with uniform anharmonicity, comprising only transmons or flux qubits, display remarkably similar dependencies of level statistics on the coupling strength. In systems with alternating anharmonicity, for typical disorder in the qubit frequencies the localized regime is found to be more resilient to the increase in qubit-qubit coupling strength in comparison to arrays with a single qubit type. Our results, which we also confirm using generalized Bose-Hubbard models, support designing devices that incorporate different qubit types to achieve higher performances.</description>

Abstract: The classification of topological phases of matter is a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics, with applications to quantum technology. Recently, this classification has been extended to the setting of Adaptive Finite-Depth Local Unitary (AFDLU) circuits which allow global classical communication. In this setting, the trivial phase is the collection of all topological states that can be prepared via AFDLU. Here, we propose a complete classification of the trivial phase by showing how to prepare all solvable anyon theories that admit a gapped boundary via AFDLU, extending recent results on solvable groups. Our construction includes non-Abelian anyons with irrational quantum dimensions, such as Ising anyons, and more general acyclic anyons. Specifically, we introduce a sequential gauging procedure, with an AFDLU implementation, to produce a string-net ground state in any topological phase described by a solvable anyon theory with gapped boundary. In addition, we introduce a sequential ungauging and regauging procedure, with an AFDLU implementation, to apply string operators of arbitrary length for anyons and symmetry twist defects in solvable anyon theories. We apply our procedure to the quantum double of the group $S_3$ and to several examples that are beyond solvable groups, including the doubled Ising theory, the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Tambara-Yamagami string-net, and doubled $SU(2)_4$ anyons.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Internet would likely be composed of diverse qubit technologies that interact through a heterogeneous quantum network. Thus, quantum transduction has been identified as a key enabler of the Quantum Internet. To better study heterogeneous quantum networks, the integration of a quantum transducer component into quantum network simulators has become crucial. In this paper, we extend SeQUeNCe, an open-source, discrete-event simulator of quantum networks, with a quantum transduction component along with auxiliary hardware device models and protocols. Moreover, we explore two strategies for transmitting quantum information between superconducting nodes via optical channels, with a focus on the impact of quantum transduction on the transmission process. The performance of these strategies is analyzed and compared through simulations conducted using SeQUeNCe. Our results align with theoretical predictions, offering simulation-based validation of the strategies and providing a path to accurate, larger-scale simulations of heterogeneous quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: Starting with an explicit framework for designing logical Clifford circuits for CSS codes, we construct logical gates for Hypergraph Product Codes. We first derive symplectic matrices for CNOT, CZ, Phase, and Hadamard operators, which together generate the Clifford group. This enables us to design explicit transformations that result in targeted logical gates for arbitrary codes in this family. As a concrete example, we give logical circuits for the $[[18,2,3]]$ toric code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future optical quantum technologies, such as quantum networks, distributed quantum computing and sensing, demand efficient, broadband quantum memories. However, achieving high efficiency without introducing noise, reducing bandwidth, or limiting scalability remains a challenge. Here, we present a new approach to enhance quantum memory protocols by leveraging constructive light-matter interference, leading to an increase in memory efficiency without increasing atomic density or laser intensity. We implement this method in a Raman quantum memory in warm Cesium vapor, and achieve more than a three-fold improvement in total efficiency reaching $(34.3\pm8.4)\%$, while retaining GHz-bandwidth operation and low noise levels. Numerical simulations predict that this approach can boost efficiencies in systems limited by atomic density, such as cold atomic ensembles, from $65\%$ to beyond $96\%$, while in warm atomic vapors it could reduce the laser intensity needed to reach a given efficiency by over an order-of-magnitude, exceeding $95\%$ total efficiency. Furthermore, our method preserves the single-mode nature of the memory at high efficiencies. This new protocol is applicable to various memory architectures, paving the way toward scalable, efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth quantum memories.</description>

      <title>FL-QDSNNs: Federated Learning with Quantum Dynamic Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Federated Learning-Quantum Dynamic Spiking Neural Networks (FL-QDSNNs), a privacy-preserving framework that maintains high predictive accuracy on non-IID client data. Its key innovation is a dynamic-threshold spiking mechanism that triggers quantum gates only when local data drift requires added expressiveness, limiting circuit depth and countering the accuracy loss typical of heterogeneous clients. Evaluated on different benchmark datasets, including Iris, where FL-QDSNNs reach 94% accuracy, the approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art quantum-federated baselines; scaling analyses demonstrate that performance remains high as the federation expands to 25 clients, confirming both computational efficiency and collaboration robustness. By uniting adaptive quantum expressiveness with strict data locality, FL-QDSNNs enable regulation-compliant quantum learning for privacy-sensitive sectors and critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Vacuum in Discrete Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider introducing the Dirac sea in a quantum cellular automata model of fermions in discrete spacetime which approximates the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, if we attempt to fill up the `negative' energy states, we run into a problem. A new boundary is created between positive and negative energy states, at which pair creation seems energetically favourable. This happens because of the modular nature of energy in discrete time models. We then suggest a possible remedy by amending the model, in order to pull states away from the new boundary.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulating continuum field theories with large-spin lattice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) is one of the most promising applications of quantum simulators. Regularizing a bosonic QFT for quantum simulation purposes typically involves a truncation in Hilbert space in addition to a discretization of space. Here, we discuss how to perform such a regularization of scalar QFTs by explicitly constructing suitable many-body lattice Hamiltonians using multi-level or qudit systems, and show that this enables quantitative predictions in the continuum limit by extrapolating results obtained for large-spin models. With extensive matrix-product state simulations, we numerically demonstrate the sequence of extrapolations that leads to quantitative agreement of observables for the integrable sine-Gordon (sG) QFT. We further show how to prepare static and moving soliton excitations, and analyze their scattering dynamics in the continuum limit, in agreement with a semi-classical model and with quantitative analytical predictions. Finally, we illustrate how a non-integrable perturbation of the sG model gives rise to dynamics reminiscent of string breaking and plasma oscillations in gauge theories. Our methods are directly applicable in state-of-the-art analog quantum simulators, opening the door to quantitatively investigating a wide variety of scalar field theories and tackling long-standing questions in non-equilibrium QFT like the fate of the false vacuum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Locally Differentially Private Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a private hypothesis testing scenario, including both symmetric and asymmetric testing, based on classical data samples. The utility is measured by the error exponents, namely the Chernoff information and the relative entropy, while privacy is measured in terms of classical or quantum local differential privacy. In this scenario, we show a quantum advantage with respect to the optimal privacy-utility trade-off (PUT) in certain cases. Specifically, we focus on distributions referred to as smoothed point mass distributions, along with the uniform distribution, as hypotheses. We then derive upper bounds on the optimal PUTs achievable by classical privacy mechanisms, which are tight in specific instances. To show the quantum advantage, we propose a particular quantum privacy mechanism that achieves better PUTs than these upper bounds in both symmetric and asymmetric testing. The proposed mechanism consists of a classical-quantum channel that prepares symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) states, followed by a depolarizing channel.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation -- a Combined Electron Microscopy, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform logical and physical resource estimation for computing binary elliptic curve discrete logarithms using Shor's algorithm on fault-tolerant quantum computers. We adopt a windowed approach to design our circuit implementation of the algorithm, which comprises repeated applications of elliptic curve point addition operations and table look-ups. Unlike previous work, the point addition operation is implemented exactly, including all exceptional cases. We provide exact logical gate and qubit counts of our algorithm for cryptographically relevant binary field sizes. Furthermore, we estimate the hardware footprint and runtime of our algorithm executed on surface-code matter-based quantum computers with a baseline architecture, where logical qubits have nearest-neighbor connectivity, and on a surface-code photonic fusion-based quantum computer with an active-volume architecture, which enjoys a logarithmic number of non-local connections between logical qubits. At 10$\%$ threshold and compared to a baseline device with a $1\mu s$ code cycle, our algorithm runs $\gtrsim$ 2-20 times faster, depending on the operating regime of the hardware and over all considered field sizes, on a photonic active-volume device.</description>

Abstract: Polarization-encoded spin-photon interfaces constitute promising candidates for the development of stationary nodes used as photon receivers, for quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. Here we introduce a time-resolved tomography approach which allows observing the dynamics of an electron spin, in a semiconductor quantum dot, mapped onto the dynamics of the polarization state of reflected photons. Through a single tomography experiment, we infer all the relevant spin dynamics timescales, including precession, decoherence and relaxation times. We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement. The control of the photon-induced back-action on the embedded spin qubit constitutes a crucial requirement for the use of spin-photon interfaces as quantum receivers.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Circuits with Tree Tensor Networks using Density-Matrix Renormalization Group Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16718v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). The framework employs a variational compression scheme that optimizes the TTN to approximate the evolved quantum state. To benchmark the method, we simulate random circuits and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory than MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a naive TTN construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that the DMRG algorithm with TTNs provides a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.</description>

      <title>Gap-preserving reductions and RE-completeness of independent set games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complexity theory, gap-preserving reductions play a crucial role in studying hardness of approximation and in analyzing the relative complexity of multiprover interactive proof systems. In the quantum setting, multiprover interactive proof systems with entangled provers correspond to gapped promise problems for nonlocal games, and the recent result MIP$^*$=RE \cite{ji2020mipre} shows that these are in general undecidable. However, the relative complexity of problems within MIP$^*$ is still not well-understood, as establishing gap-preserving reductions in the quantum setting presents new challenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework to study such reductions and use it to establish MIP$^*$-completeness of the gapped promise problem for the natural class of independent set games. In such a game, the goal is to determine whether a given graph contains an independent set of a specified size. We construct families of independent set games with constant question size for which the gapped promise problem is undecidable. In contrast, the same problem is decidable in polynomial time in the classical setting. To carry out our reduction, we establish a new stability theorem, which could be of independent interest, allowing us to perturb families of almost PVMs to genuine PVMs.</description>

Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. We show that the optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed. Via the optimality criterion, this suggests also a proof of the conjecture concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids put forward in [2].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision optical frequency measurement is indispensable to modern science and technology, yet conventional spectroscopic techniques struggle to resolve sub-linewidth spectral features. We introduce a unique platform for super-resolving frequency estimation utilizing a mode-selective atomic Raman quantum memory implemented in warm cesium vapor. By precisely engineering the light matter interaction, our memory coherently stores the optimal temporal mode with high fidelity and retrieves it on-demand, realizing a mode crosstalk as low as 0.34%. To estimate the separation between two spectral lines, we experimentally measure the mean squared error of the frequency estimate, achieving a sensitivity of 1/20 of the linewidth with a ($34\pm4$)-fold enhancement in precision over direct intensity measurements. This enhanced frequency resolution, combined with the memory's on-demand storage, retrieval, and mode conversion capabilities, paves the way for multifunctional memory-based time-frequency sensors and their integration within quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Unification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new perspective on unifying all fundamental interactions--gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong--based on stochastic processes rather than conventional quantum mechanics. Earlier work by Nelson, Kac and others have established that key quantum features such as the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations together with the Born rule can be derived from classical random processes involving finite speeds and probabilistic reversals. A fundamental length scale, inherent for dimensional consistency, regularizes the infinities that typically plague conventional field theories. The method can be used to quantize electrodynamics as well as linear gravity, using the Riemann-Silberstein vector and its generalization.
  To include fields beyond electromagnetism, the Riemann-Silberstein vector can be generalized to describe non-Abelian gauge fields without relying on gauge symmetry. These fields can be coupled to spin networks--geometric structures that discretize space--leading to a unified framework that includes both matter and geometrty. In the large-scale limit, the model reproduces familiar quantum field behaviour, while remaining finite and background-independent at the fundamental level. The emergence of equilibrium states resembling Wheeler-DeWill constraints in gravity adds further depth, suggesting a novel route to quantum gravity and unification grounded in physical stochasticity rather than quantization rules.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation Solution with Generalized tanh-Shaped Hyperbolic Potential: Application to Charmonium and Bottomonium Mass Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15538v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analytical solution of the Dirac equation in a generalized tanh-shape hyperbolic potential, which allows us to unify various well-known quantum potentials under a single theoretical framework. This versatile potential model is used to compute the mass spectra for charmonium and bottomonium, with excellent agreement with experimental measurements and does better than some potential models in predicting the several orbital states. Our results not only validate the GTHP as a powerful tool for describing heavy quarkonium systems but also suggest its broader applicability in exploring quantum systems where similar potentials are effective. This work is a stepping stone for new research into fermionic systems with complex interactions, by jointly providing insights into foundational aspects of quantum mechanics as well as applications in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dispersion of shear waves in dipolar supersolids</title>

Abstract: Dipolar supersolids--quantum states that are simultaneously superfluid and solid--have had their superfluid nature rigorously tested, while their solid nature remain uncharted. Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound. While the distinction between anomalous and normal dispersion appears subtle, it has a profound influence on both the transport and scattering properties. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-ergodic multifractal quantum states in geometrical fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals, which may also be observed in many-body localized states, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics, from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal states (NEMs) without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into a fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find robust evidence of the emergence of NEMs that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>

      <title>Proposed Five-Electron Charge Quadrupole Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A charge qubit couples to environmental electric field fluctuations through its dipole moment, resulting in fast decoherence. We propose the p orbital (pO) qubit, formed by the single electron, p-like valence states of a five-electron Si quantum dot, which couples to charge noise through the quadrupole moment. We demonstrate that the pO qubit offers distinct advantages in quality factor, gate speed, readout and size. We use a phenomenological, dipole two-level-fluctuator charge noise model to estimate a $T_2^* \sim 80$ ns. In conjunction with Rabi frequencies of order 10 GHz, an order of magnitude improvement in qubit quality factor is expected relative to state-of-the-art semiconductor spin qubits. The pO qubit features all-electrical control via modulating the dot's eccentricity. We also show how to perform two-qubit gates via the $1/r^5$ quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. We find a universal gate set using gradient ascent based control pulse optimization, subject to 10 GHz maximum allowable bandwidth and 1 ns pulse times.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Krylov State Complexity in Random Matrix Quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, time-evolved states typically remain confined to a smaller region of the Hilbert space known as the $\textit{Krylov subspace}$. The time evolution can be mapped onto a one-dimensional problem of a particle moving on a chain, where the average position $\langle n \rangle$ defines Krylov state complexity or spread complexity. Generalized spread complexities, associated with higher-order moments $\langle n^p \rangle$ for $p&gt;1$, provide finer insights into the dynamics. We investigate the time evolution of generalized spread complexities following a quantum quench in random matrix theory. The quench is implemented by transitioning from an initial random Hamiltonian to a post-quench Hamiltonian obtained by dividing it into four blocks and flipping the sign of the off-diagonal blocks. This setup captures universal features of chaotic quantum quenches. When the initial state is the thermofield double state of the post-quench Hamiltonian, a peak in spread complexity preceding equilibration signals level repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos. We examine the robustness of this peak for other initial states, such as the ground state or the thermofield double state of the pre-quench Hamiltonian. To quantify this behavior, we introduce a measure based on the peak height relative to the late-time saturation value. In the continuous limit, higher-order complexities show increased sensitivity to the peak, supported by numerical simulations for finite-size random matrices.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in silicon via controllable strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17290v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a digital twin physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <title>Effective Description of Ajar Systems with a $U(1)$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "ajar systems" as an intermediate case between closed and open systems, where the time scale for charge exchange with the environment is parametrically larger than all other characteristic time scales. The Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for such finite-temperature systems exhibits a symmetry group $G_1 \times G_2$ weakly broken to its diagonal subgroup $G_{\text{diag}}$, which we systematically describe using spurion techniques. For $G = U(1)$, we calculate leading-order corrections to correlation functions in both diffusive and spontaneously broken phases. Unlike systems with approximate symmetries where both real and imaginary parts of dispersion relations receive corrections, ajar systems modify only the imaginary part -- preserving gapless modes while adding finite damping.</description>

      <title>Consistent quantum treatments of non-convex kinetic energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic energies (which appear, e.g., in nonlinear capacitors or classical time crystals) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the coupling strength to a dissipative environment. There occurs a dissipative phase transition from a nonconvex Hamiltonian to a convex Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. Our approach thus resolves apparent inconsistencies and provides computationally efficient methods to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.</description>
