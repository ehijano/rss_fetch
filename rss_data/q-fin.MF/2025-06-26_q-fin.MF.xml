      <title>Linear short rate model with several delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a short rate model in continuous time that adds one or more memory (delay) components to the Merton model (Merton 1970, 1973) or the Vasi\v{c}ek model (Vasi\v{c}ek 1977) for the short rate. The distribution of the short rate in this model is normal, with the mean depending on past values of the short rate, and a limiting distribution exists for certain values of the parameters. The zero coupon bond price is an affine function of the short rate, whose coefficients satisfy a system of delay differential equations. This system can be solved analytically, obtaining a closed formula. An analytical expression for the instantaneous forward rate is given: it satisfies the risk neutral dynamics of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton model. Formulae for both forward looking and backward looking caplets on overnight risk free rates are presented. Finally, the proposed model is calibrated against forward looking caplets on SONIA rates and the United States yield curve.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dynamic Fees in Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are emerging as a popular decentralised trading platform. In this work, we determine the optimal dynamic fees in a constant function market maker. We find approximate closed-form solutions to the control problem and study the optimal fee structure. We find that there are two distinct fee regimes: one in which the AMM imposes higher fees to deter arbitrageurs, and another where fees are lowered to increase volatility and attract noise traders. Our results also show that dynamic fees that are linear in inventory and are sensitive to changes in the external price are a good approximation of the optimal fee structure and thus constitute suitable candidates when designing fees for AMMs.</description>

      <title>American options valuation in time-dependent jump-diffusion models via integral equations and characteristic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in machine learning for derivative pricing, the efficient and accurate valuation of American options remains a persistent challenge due to complex exercise boundaries, near-expiry behavior, and intricate contractual features. This paper extends a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models, including pure diffusions, jump-diffusions, and Levy processes. Building on prior work, we derive and solve Volterra integral equations of the second kind to determine the exercise boundary explicitly, offering a computationally superior alternative to traditional finite-difference and Monte Carlo methods. We address key open problems: (1) extending the decomposition method, i.e. splitting the American option price into its European counterpart and an early exercise premium, to general jump-diffusion and Levy models; (2) handling cases where closed-form transition densities are unavailable by leveraging characteristic functions via, e.g., the COS method; and (3) generalizing the framework to multidimensional diffusions. Numerical examples demonstrate the method's efficiency and robustness. Our results underscore the advantages of the integral equation approach for large-scale industrial applications, while resolving some limitations of existing techniques.</description>
