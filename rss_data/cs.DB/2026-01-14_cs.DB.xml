      <title>CSQL: Mapping Documents into Causal Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel system, CSQL, which automatically converts a collection of unstructured text documents into an SQL-queryable causal database (CDB). A CDB differs from a traditional DB: it is designed to answer "why'' questions via causal interventions and structured causal queries. CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: "What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or "Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL. Viewed abstractly, CSQL functions as a compiler from unstructured documents into a causal database equipped with a principled algebra of queries, and can be applied broadly across many domains ranging from business, humanities, and science.</description>

      <title>SVFusion: A CPU-GPU Co-Processing Architecture for Large-Scale Real-Time Vector Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) underpins modern applications such as information retrieval and recommendation. With the rapid growth of vector data, efficient indexing for real-time vector search has become rudimentary. Existing CPU-based solutions support updates but suffer from low throughput, while GPU-accelerated systems deliver high performance but face challenges with dynamic updates and limited GPU memory, resulting in a critical performance gap for continuous, large-scale vector search requiring both accuracy and speed. In this paper, we present SVFusion, a GPU-CPU-disk collaborative framework for real-time vector search that bridges sophisticated GPU computation with online updates. SVFusion leverages a hierarchical vector index architecture that employs CPU-GPU co-processing, along with a workload-aware vector caching mechanism to maximize the efficiency of limited GPU memory. It further enhances performance through real-time coordination with CUDA multi-stream optimization and adaptive resource management, along with concurrency control that ensures data consistency under interleaved queries and updates. Empirical results demonstrate that SVFusion achieves significant improvements in query latency and throughput, exhibiting a 20.9x higher throughput on average and 1.3x to 50.7x lower latency compared to baseline methods, while maintaining high recall for large-scale datasets under various streaming workloads.</description>

      <title>Efficient Maintenance of Leiden Communities in Large Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a well-known community detection algorithm, Leiden has been widely used in various scenarios such as large language model generation (e.g., Graph-RAG), anomaly detection, and biological analysis. In these scenarios, the graphs are often large and dynamic, where vertices and edges are inserted and deleted frequently, so it is costly to obtain the updated communities by Leiden from scratch when the graph has changed. Recently, one work has attempted to study how to maintain Leiden communities in the dynamic graph, but it lacks a detailed theoretical analysis, and its algorithms are inefficient for large graphs. To address these issues, in this paper, we first theoretically show that the existing algorithms are relatively unbounded via the boundedness analysis (a powerful tool for analyzing incremental algorithms on dynamic graphs), and also analyze the memberships of vertices in communities when the graph changes. Based on theoretical analysis, we develop a novel efficient maintenance algorithm, called Hierarchical Incremental Tree Leiden (HIT-Leiden), which effectively reduces the range of affected vertices by maintaining the connected components and hierarchical community structures. Comprehensive experiments in various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HIT-Leiden. In particular, it achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Pervasive Annotation Errors Break Text-to-SQL Benchmarks and Leaderboards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08778v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers have proposed many text-to-SQL techniques to streamline data analytics and accelerate the development of database-driven applications. To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.
  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

      <title>A Decade of Systems for Human Data Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-data interaction (HDI) presents fundamentally different challenges from traditional data management. HDI systems must meet latency, correctness, and consistency needs that stem from usability rather than query semantics; failing to meet these expectations breaks the user experience. Moreover, interfaces and systems are tightly coupled; neither can easily be optimized in isolation, and effective solutions demand their co-design. This dependence also presents a research opportunity: rather than adapt systems to interface demands, systems innovations and database theory can also inspire new interaction and visualization designs. We survey a decade of our lab's work that embraces this coupling and argue that HDI systems are the foundation for reliable, interactive, AI-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Rule Rewriting Revisited: A Fresh Look at Static Filtering for Datalog and ASP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static filtering is a data-independent optimisation method for Datalog, which generalises algebraic query rewriting techniques from relational databases. In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity. As a solution, we propose tractable approximations of the algorithm that can still yield much improved logic programs in typical cases, e.g., it can improve the performance of rule systems over real-world data in the order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Reproducible Biomedical Question Answering using Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical question-answering (QA) systems require effective retrieval and generation components to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. This study systematically examines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for biomedical QA, evaluating retrieval strategies and response time trade-offs. We first assess state-of-the-art retrieval methods, including BM25, BioBERT, MedCPT, and a hybrid approach, alongside common data stores such as Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and FAISS, on a ~10% subset of PubMed (2.4M documents) to measure indexing efficiency, retrieval latency, and retriever performance in the end-to-end RAG system. Based on these insights, we deploy the final RAG system on the full 24M PubMed corpus, comparing different retrievers' impact on overall performance. Evaluations of the retrieval depth show that retrieving 50 documents with BM25 before reranking with MedCPT optimally balances accuracy (0.90), recall (0.90), and response time (1.91s). BM25 retrieval time remains stable (82ms), while MedCPT incurs the main computational cost. These results highlight previously not well-known trade-offs in retrieval depth, efficiency, and scalability for biomedical QA. With open-source code, the system is fully reproducible and extensible.</description>

      <title>Data Science: a Natural Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript provides a systemic and data-centric view of what we term essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions stemming from the fusion of data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges that are defined according to the missions. We define specific discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science into computational, and foundational. By formalizing this ecosystemic view, we contribute a general-purpose, fusion-oriented architecture for integrating heterogeneous knowledge, agents, and workflows-relevant to a wide range of disciplines and high-impact applications.</description>
