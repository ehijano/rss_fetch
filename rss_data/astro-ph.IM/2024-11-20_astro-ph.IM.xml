      <title>Cascade adaptive optics with a second stage based on a Zernike wavefront sensor for exoplanet observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the past decade, the high-contrast observation of disks and gas giant planets around nearby stars has been made possible on ground-based instruments using extreme adaptive optics (XAO). While these facilities produce images with a Strehl ratio larger than 90% in H-band in median observing conditions and high-flux regime, the correction leaves AO residuals which prevent the study of fainter or less massive exoplanets. Cascade AO systems with a fast second stage based on a Pyramid wavefront sensor have recently emerged as an appealing solution to reduce the atmospheric wavefront errors. Since these aberrations are expected to be small, they can also be accurately measured by a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS), a well-known concept for its high sensitivity and moderate linear capture range. We propose an alternative second stage relying on the ZWFS to correct for the AO residuals. The cascade AO with a ZWFS-based control loop is implemented on the ESO's GHOST testbed to validate the scheme in monochromatic light. In median wind speed and seeing, our second-stage AO with a ZWFS and a basic integrator reduce the atmospheric residuals by a factor of 6 and increase the wavefront error stability with a gain of 2 from open to closed loop. In the presence of non common path aberrations, we also reach a contrast gain by a factor of 2 in the images with a Lyot coronagraph at short separations from the source, proving the ability of our scheme to work in cascade with an XAO loop and help imaging fainter or lighter close-in companions. In more challenging conditions, contrast improvements are also achieved by adjusting the control loop features. Our study validates the ZWFS-based second-stage AO loop as an effective solution to address small residuals left from a single-stage XAO system for the coronagraphic observations of circumstellar environments.</description>

      <title>STIPS: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Imaging Product Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Space Telescope Imaging Product Simulator (STIPS) is a Python-based package that can be used to simulate scenes from the upcoming \textit{Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope} (\nancy). STIPS is able to generate post-pipeline astronomical images of any number of sensor chip assembly (SCA) detectors, up to the entire 18-SCA Wide-Field Instrument array on \nancy. STIPS can inject either point spread functions generated with {\tt WebbPSF}, or extended sources in any of the \nancy filters. The output images can include flat field, dark current, and cosmic ray residuals. Additionally, STIPS includes an estimate of Poisson and readout noise, as well as an estimate of the zodiacal background and internal background from the telescope. However, STIPS does not include instrument saturation, non-linearity, or distortion effects. STIPS is provided as an open source repository on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Hard X-ray and gamma-ray detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based astronomy of hard X-rays and gamma rays covers more than seven orders of magnitude in photon energy, from 10 keV to several hundred GeV. Detecting cosmic photons in this energy range is a challenge, due to the relatively low probability of interaction of high-energy photons with matter and the high background noise generated in space detectors by environmental charged particles and radiation. However, the development of new detection technologies is constantly improving the performance of space-based X- and gamma-ray telescopes. This chapter presents the different detectors used in this field of astronomy, their configuration within space telescopes and some proposals for new instruments.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning VLBI Image Reconstruction with Closure Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric closure invariants, constructed from triangular loops of mixed Fourier components, capture calibration-independent information on source morphology. While a complete set of closure invariants is directly obtainable from measured visibilities, the inverse transformation from closure invariants to the source intensity distribution is not established. In this work, we demonstrate a deep learning approach, Deep learning Image Reconstruction with Closure Terms (DIReCT), to directly reconstruct the image from closure invariants. Trained on both well-defined mathematical shapes (two-dimensional gaussians, disks, ellipses, $m$-rings) and natural images (CIFAR-10), the results from our specially designed model are insensitive to station-based corruptions and thermal noise. The median fidelity score between the reconstruction and the blurred ground truth achieved is $\gtrsim 0.9$ even for untrained morphologies, where a unit score denotes perfect reconstruction. In our validation tests, DIReCT's results are comparable to other state-of-the-art deconvolution and regularised maximum-likelihood image reconstruction algorithms, with the advantage that DIReCT does not require hand-tuned hyperparameters for each individual prediction. This independent approach shows promising results and offers a calibration-independent constraint on source morphology, ultimately complementing and improving the reliability of sparse VLBI imaging results.</description>

      <title>Aperture correction for Beamforming in radiometric detection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For high-energy cosmic-ray physics, it is imperative to determine the mass and energy of the cosmic ray that initiated the air shower in the atmosphere. This information can be extracted from the longitudinal profile of the air shower. In radio-metric observations, this profile is customarily determined through an extensive fitting procedure where calculated radio intensity is fitted to data. Beamforming the measured signals offers a promising alternative to bypass the cumbersome fitting procedure and to determine the longitudinal profile directly. Finite aperture effects in beamforming hamper the resolution with which this profile can be determined. We present a comprehensive investigation of the beamforming resolution in radiometric observations of air showers. There are two, principally different, approaches possible in air-shower beamforming, one where the total beamforming intensity is determined and an alternative where the beamforming trace is cross-correlated with a known response function. The effects due to a finite aperture (size of antenna array and bandwidth) are large for both approaches. We argue that it is possible to correct for the aperture corrections using an unfolding procedure. We give an explicit expression for the folding function, the kernel. Being able to calculate the folding function allows for unfolding the finite aperture effects from the data. We show that, in a model-to-model comparison, this allows for an accurate reconstruction of the current profile as the shower develops in the atmosphere. We present also an example where we reconstruct the longitudinal current profile of a shower developing under thunderstorm conditions where the atmospheric electric fields greatly alter the orientation of the transverse current in the shower front.</description>

      <title>Controlled Partial Gravity Platform for Milligravity in Drop Tower Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail a platform for partial g environment and an experiment for simulated impacts on asteroid surfaces based on it. The partial g environment is created by a two stage approach: First, create microgravity using the ZARM drop tower. Second, convert microgravity to partial gravity by steady acceleration of experiment volume on linear drive inside microgravity environment. The experiment we conducted on this platform simulates low-velocity impacts into a simulated asteroid surface. To recreate the asteroid environment, in addition to the partial gravity, a vacuum chamber is used. We explain requirements, setup and operation of partial gravity platform and experiment and discuss its performance. Finally, we are open for requests for external experiments which might benefit from our platform with $9.3\,$s of controlled partial gravity down to the mm/s$^2$ range with low g-jitter.</description>

      <title>The Challenges of Modeling Astrophysical Reacting Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar evolution is driven by the changing composition of a star from nuclear reactions. At the late stages of evolution and during explosive events, the timescale can be short and drive strong hydrodynamic flows, making simulations of astrophysical reacting flows challenging. Over the past decades, the standard approach to modeling reactions in simulation codes has been operator splitting, using implicit integrators for reactions. Here we explore some of the assumptions in this standard approach and describe some techniques for improving the efficiency and accuracy of astrophysical reacting flows.</description>

      <title>flashcurve: A machine-learning approach for the simple and fast generation of adaptive-binning light curves with Fermi-LAT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma rays measured by the Fermi-LAT satellite tell us a lot about the processes taking place in high-energetic astrophysical objects. The fluxes coming from these objects are, however, extremely variable. Hence, gamma-ray light curves optimally use adaptive bin sizes in order to retrieve most information about the source dynamics and to combine gamma-ray observations in a multi-messenger perspective. However, standard adaptive binning approaches are slow, expensive and inaccurate in highly populated regions. Here, we present a novel, powerful, deep-learning-based approach to estimate the necessary time windows for adaptive binning light curves in Fermi-LAT data using raw photon data. The approach is shown to be fast and accurate. It can also be seen as a prototype to train machine-learning models for adaptive binning light curves for other astrophysical messengers.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency and Low-Noise Detectors for the Upgraded CLASS 90 GHz Focal Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the in-lab and on-sky performance for the upgraded 90 GHz focal plane of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), which had four of its seven detector wafers updated during the austral winter of 2022. The update aimed to improve the transition-edge-sensor (TES) stability and bias range and to realize the high optical efficiency of the sensor design. Modifications included revised circuit terminations, electrical contact between the TES superconductor and the normal metal providing the bulk of the bolometer's heat capacity, and additional filtering on the TES bias lines. The upgrade was successful: 94% of detectors are stable down to 15% of the normal resistance, providing a wide overlapping range of bias voltages for all TESs on a wafer. The median telescope efficiency improved from $0.42^{+0.15}_{-0.22}$ to $0.60^{+0.10}_{-0.32}$ (68% quantiles). For the four upgraded wafers alone, median telescope efficiency increased to $0.65^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$. Given our efficiency estimate for the receiver optics, this telescope efficiency implies a detector efficiency exceeding $0.90$. The overall noise-equivalent temperature of the 90 GHz focal plane improved from 19 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$ to 11.3 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$.</description>

      <title>Mining for Protoclusters at $z\sim4$ from Photometric Datasets with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoclusters are high-$z$ overdense regions that will evolve into clusters of galaxies by $z=0$, making them ideal for studying galaxy evolution expected to be accelerated by environmental effects. However, it has been challenging to identify protoclusters beyond $z=3$ only by photometry due to large redshift uncertainties, hindering statistical study. To tackle the issue, we develop a new deep-learning-based protocluster detection model, PCFNet, which considers a protocluster as a point cloud. To detect protoclusters at $z\sim4$ using only optical broad-band photometry, we train and evaluate PCFNet with mock $g$-dropout galaxies based on the N-body simulation with the semi-analytic model. We use the sky distribution, $i$-band magnitude, $(g-i)$ color, and the redshift probability density function surrounding a target galaxy on the sky. PCFNet achieves to detect five times more protocluster member candidates while maintaining high purity (recall $=7.5\pm0.2$%, precision $=44\pm1$%) than conventional methods. Moreover, PCFNet is able to detect more progenitors ($M_\mathrm{halo}^{z=0}=10^{14-14.5}\,M_\odot$) that are less massive than supermassive clusters like the Coma cluster. We apply PCFNet to the observational photometric dataset of the HSC-SSP Deep/UltraDeep layer ($\sim17\mathrm{\,deg^2}$) and detect $121$ protocluster candidates at $z\sim4$. We find the rest-UV luminosities of our protocluster member candidates are brighter than those of field galaxies, which is consistent with previous studies. Additionally, the quenching of satellite galaxies depends on both the core galaxy's halo mass at $z\sim4$ and accumulated mass until $z=0$ in the simulation. PCFNet is very flexible and can find protoclusters at other redshifts or in future extensive surveys by Euclid, LSST, and Roman.</description>

      <title>CMBAnalysis: A Modern Framework for High-Precision Cosmic Microwave Background Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present CMBAnalysis, a state-of-the-art Python framework designed for high-precision analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation data. This comprehensive package implements parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for robust cosmological parameter estimation, featuring adaptive integration methods and sophisticated error propagation. The framework incorporates recent advances in computational cosmology, including support for extended cosmological models, detailed systematic error analysis, and optimized numerical algorithms. I demonstrate its capabilities through analysis of Planck Legacy Archive data, achieving parameter constraints competitive with established pipelines while offering significant performance improvements through parallel processing and algorithmic optimizations. Notable features include automated convergence diagnostics, comprehensive uncertainty quantification, and publication-quality visualization tools. The framework's modular architecture facilitates extension to new cosmological models and analysis techniques, while maintaining numerical stability through carefully implemented regularization schemes. My implementation achieves excellent computational efficiency, with parallel MCMC sampling reducing analysis time by up to 75\% compared to serial implementations. The code is open-source, extensively documented, and includes a comprehensive test suite, making it valuable for both research applications and educational purposes in modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>Assessing Matched Filtering for Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae are a promising yet challenging target for detection due to the stochastic and complex nature of these signals. Conventional detection methods for core-collapse supernovae rely on excess energy searches because matched filtering has been hindered by the lack of well-defined waveform templates. However, numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae have improved our understanding of the gravitational wave signals they emit, which enables us, for the first time, to construct a set of templates that closely resemble predictions from numerical simulations. In this study, we investigate the possibility of detecting gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae using a matched-filtering methods. We construct a theoretically-informed template bank and use it to recover a core-collapse supernova signal injected into real LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector data. We evaluate the detection efficiency of the matched-filtering approach and how well the injected signal is reconstructed. We discuss the false alarm rate of our approach and investigate the main source of false triggers. We recover 88\% of the signals injected at a distance of 1 kpc and 50% of the signals injected at 2 kpc. For more than 50% of the recovered events, the underlying signal characteristics are reconstructed within an error of 15%. We discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach and identify areas for further improvements to advance the potential of matched filtering for supernova gravitational-wave detection. We also present the open-source Python package SynthGrav used to generate the template bank.</description>

      <title>Estimating Dark Matter Halo Masses in Simulated Galaxy Clusters with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies grow and evolve in dark matter halos. Because dark matter is not visible, galaxies' halo masses ($\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$) must be inferred indirectly. We present a graph neural network (GNN) model for predicting $\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$ from stellar mass ($\rm{M}_{*}$) in simulated galaxy clusters using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Unlike traditional machine learning models like random forests, our GNN captures the information-rich substructure of galaxy clusters by using spatial and kinematic relationships between galaxy neighbour. A GNN model trained on the TNG-Cluster dataset and independently tested on the TNG300 simulation achieves superior predictive performance compared to other baseline models we tested. Future work will extend this approach to different simulations and real observational datasets to further validate the GNN model's ability to generalise.</description>

Here, we apply hyper realistic radiative simulations of Earth as an exoplanet comprising thousands of simulations and study the unresolved spectrum. The GlobES module on the Planetary Spectrum Generator was used, and we parameterized the atmosphere as described in the modern earth retrospective analysis for research and applications, MERRA2, database. The simulations were made into high spatial resolution images and compared to space based observations from the DSCOVR EPIC, at L1, and Himawari8, geostationary, satellites, confirming spatial variations and the spectral intensities of the simulations. The DSCOVR EPIC camera only functions in narrow wavelength bands, but strong agreement is demonstrated. It is shown that aerosols and small particles play an important role in defining Earths reflectance spectra, contributing significantly to its characteristic blue color. Subsequently, a comprehensive noise model is employed to constrain the exposure time required to detect O2, O3 and H2O as a function of varying ground and cloud cover for several concept observatories, including the habitable worlds observatory. Cloud coverage enhances the detectability of planets in reflected light, with important consequences for the design of the future HWO. The HWO concept would require between 3 to 10 times longer to observe the studied features than LUVOIR A but performs better than the HabEx without a starshade. The codes, routines, and the noise models are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous planet masses I: Reanalysis of archival HARPS radial velocities</title>

Abstract: Empirical exoplanet mass-radius relations have been used to study the demographics and compositions of small exoplanets for many years. However, the heterogeneous nature of these measurements hinders robust statistical analysis of this population, particularly with regard to the masses of planets. For this reason, we perform a homogeneous and consistent re-analysis of the radial velocity (RV) observations of 85 small exoplanets using publicly available HARPS RV data and the fitting toolkit Pyaneti. For the entire sample, we run 12 different models to investigate the impact of modelling choices, including the use of multi-dimensional Gaussian Processes (GPs) to mitigate stellar activity. We find that the way orbital eccentricity is modelled can significantly impact the RV amplitude found in some cases. We also find that the addition of a GP to mitigate stellar activity does impact the RV amplitude found - though if the GP is modelled on activity indicators as well as the RVs the results are more robust. The RV amplitude found for every planet in our sample using all the models is made available for other groups to perform demographics studies. Finally, we provide a list of recommendations for the RV community moving forward.</description>

      <title>On a Generating Function for the Isotropic Basis Functions and Other Connected Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently isotropic basis functions of $N$ unit vector arguments were presented; these are of significant use in measuring the N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs) of galaxy clustering. Here we develop the generating function for these basis functions -- $i.e.$ that function which, expanded in a power series, has as its angular part the isotropic functions. We show that this can be developed using basic properties of the plane wave. A main use of the generating function is as an efficient route to obtaining the Cartesian basis expressions for the isotropic functions. We show that the methods here enable computing difficult overlap integrals of multiple spherical Bessel functions, and we also give related expansions of the Dirac Delta function into the isotropic basis. Finally, we outline how the Cartesian expressions for the isotropic basis functions might be used to enable a faster NPCF algorithm on the CPU.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian regression in astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model mis-specification (e.g. the presence of outliers) is commonly encountered in astronomical analyses, often requiring the use of ad hoc algorithms (e.g. sigma-clipping). We develop and implement a generic Bayesian approach to linear regression, based on Student's t-distributions, that is robust to outliers and mis-specification of the noise model. Our method is validated using simulated datasets with various degrees of model mis-specification; the derived constraints are shown to be systematically less biased than those from a similar model using normal distributions. We demonstrate that, for a dataset without outliers, a worst-case inference using t-distributions would give unbiased results with $\lesssim\!10$ per cent increase in the reported parameter uncertainties. We also compare with existing analyses of real-world datasets, finding qualitatively different results where normal distributions have been used and agreement where more robust methods have been applied. A Python implementation of this model, t-cup, is made available for others to use.</description>

      <title>Reliable Detections of Atmospheres on Rocky Exoplanets with Photometric JWST Phase Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of different types of atmospheres and surfaces on rocky planets is one of the major questions in exoplanet astronomy, but there are currently no published unambiguous detections of atmospheres on any rocky exoplanets. The MIRI instrument on JWST can measure thermal emission from tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting small, cool stars. This emission is a function of their surface and atmospheric properties, potentially allowing the detection of atmospheres. One technique is to measure day-side emission to search for lower thermal emission than expected for a black-body planet due to atmospheric absorption features. Another technique is to measure phase curves of thermal emission to search for night-side emission due to atmospheric heat redistribution. In this work we compare strategies for detecting atmospheres on rocky exoplanets using these techniques. We simulate secondary eclipse and phase curve observations in the MIRI F1500W and F1280W filters, for a range of surfaces and atmospheres on thirty exoplanets selected for their F1500W signal-to-noise ratio. Our results show that secondary eclipse observations are highly degenerate between surfaces and atmospheres, given the wide range of potential surface albedos. We also show that thick atmospheres can support emission consistent with a black-body planet in these filters. These two results make it difficult to unambiguously detect or rule out atmospheres using their photometric day-side emission, except in a subset of CO$_{2}$-dominated atmospheres. We suggest that an F1500W phase curve could instead be observed for a similar sample of planets, allowing the unambiguous detection of atmospheres by night-side emission.</description>

      <title>Solar flares in the Solar Orbiter era: Short-exposure EUI/FSI observations of STIX flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims: This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of short-exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares in the study of particle acceleration, heating and energy partition in flares. This work highlights the observations now available from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument suite on board Solar Orbiter while operating in short-exposure mode.
  Methods: A selection of noteworthy flares observed simultaneously by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and the Full Sun Imager of EUI (EUI/FSI) are detailed. New insights are highlighted and potential avenues of investigation are demonstrated, including forward-modelling the atmospheric response to a non-thermal beam of electrons using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code, in order to compare the predicted and observed EUV emission.
  Results: The examples given in this work demonstrate that short-exposure EUI/FSI observations are providing important diagnostics during flares. A dataset of more than 9000 flares observed by STIX (from November 2022 until December 2023) with at least one short-exposure EUI/FSI 174 \r{A} image is currently available. The observations reveal that the brightest parts of short-exposure observations consist of substructure in flaring ribbons that spatially overlap with the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX in the majority of cases. We show that these observations provide an opportunity to further constrain the electron energy flux required for flare modelling, among other potential applications.</description>
