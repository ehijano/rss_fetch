      <title>End-to-end Surface Optimization for Light Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a freeform surface to reflect or refract light to achieve a target distribution is a challenging inverse problem. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end optimization strategy for an optical surface mesh. Our formulation leverages a novel differentiable rendering model, and is directly driven by the difference between the resulting light distribution and the target distribution. We also enforce geometric constraints related to fabrication requirements, to facilitate CNC milling and polishing of the designed surface. To address the issue of local minima, we formulate a face-based optimal transport problem between the current mesh and the target distribution, which makes effective large changes to the surface shape. The combination of our optimal transport update and rendering-guided optimization produces an optical surface design with a resulting image closely resembling the target, while the fabrication constraints in our optimization help to ensure consistency between the rendering model and the final physical results. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated on a variety of target images using both simulated rendering and physical prototypes.</description>

      <title>Identifying Locally Turbulent Vortices within Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an approach for the automatic detection of locally turbulent vortices within turbulent 2D flows such as instabilites. First, given a time step of the flow, methods from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) are leveraged to extract the geometry of the vortices. Specifically, the enstrophy of the flow is simplified by topological persistence, and the vortices are extracted by collecting the basins of the simplified enstrophy's Morse complex. Next, the local kinetic energy power spectrum is computed for each vortex. We introduce a set of indicators based on the kinetic energy power spectrum to estimate the correlation between the vortex's behavior and that of an idealized turbulent vortex. Our preliminary experiments show the relevance of these indicators for distinguishing vortices which are turbulent from those which have not yet reached a turbulent state and thus known as laminar.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Streaming Feature Selection with Causal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Its crux lies in the optimization of a tradeoff between accuracy and fairness of resultant models on the selected feature subset. The technical challenge of our setting is twofold: 1) streaming feature inputs, such that an informative feature may become obsolete or redundant for prediction if its information has been covered by other similar features that arrived prior to it, and 2) non-associational feature correlation, such that bias may be leaked from those seemingly admissible, non-protected features. To overcome this, we propose Streaming Feature Selection with Causal Fairness (SFCF) that builds two causal graphs egocentric to prediction label and protected feature, respectively, striving to model the complex correlation structure among streaming features, labels, and protected information. As such, bias can be eradicated from predictive modeling by removing those features being causally correlated with the protected feature yet independent to the labels. We theorize that the originally redundant features for prediction can later become admissible, when the learning accuracy is compromised by the large number of removed features (non-protected but can be used to reconstruct bias information). We benchmark SFCF\ on five datasets widely used in streaming feature research, and the results substantiate its performance superiority over six rival models in terms of efficiency and sparsity of feature selection and equalized odds of the resultant predictive models.</description>

      <title>Diverse Part Synthesis for 3D Shape Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods that use neural networks for synthesizing 3D shapes in the form of a part-based representation have been introduced over the last few years. These methods represent shapes as a graph or hierarchy of parts and enable a variety of applications such as shape sampling and reconstruction. However, current methods do not allow easily regenerating individual shape parts according to user preferences. In this paper, we investigate techniques that allow the user to generate multiple, diverse suggestions for individual parts. Specifically, we experiment with multimodal deep generative models that allow sampling diverse suggestions for shape parts and focus on models which have not been considered in previous work on shape synthesis. To provide a comparative study of these techniques, we introduce a method for synthesizing 3D shapes in a part-based representation and evaluate all the part suggestion techniques within this synthesis method. In our method, which is inspired by previous work, shapes are represented as a set of parts in the form of implicit functions which are then positioned in space to form the final shape. Synthesis in this representation is enabled by a neural network architecture based on an implicit decoder and a spatial transformer. We compare the various multimodal generative models by evaluating their performance in generating part suggestions. Our contribution is to show with qualitative and quantitative evaluations which of the new techniques for multimodal part generation perform the best and that a synthesis method based on the top-performing techniques allows the user to more finely control the parts that are generated in the 3D shapes while maintaining high shape fidelity when reconstructing shapes.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Control for Geometry-Conditioned PBR Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphics pipelines require physically-based rendering (PBR) materials, yet current 3D content generation approaches are built on RGB models. We propose to model the PBR image distribution directly, avoiding photometric inaccuracies in RGB generation and the inherent ambiguity in extracting PBR from RGB. As existing paradigms for cross-modal fine-tuning are not suited for PBR generation due to both a lack of data and the high dimensionality of the output modalities, we propose to train a new PBR model that is tightly linked to a frozen RGB model using a novel cross-network communication paradigm. As the base RGB model is fully frozen, the proposed method retains its general performance and remains compatible with e.g. IPAdapters for that base model.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multi-modal Neural Scene Representations With Applications on Thermal Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) quickly evolved as the new de-facto standard for the task of novel view synthesis when trained on a set of RGB images. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of neural scene representations, such as NeRFs, in the context of multi-modal learning. Specifically, we present four different strategies of how to incorporate a second modality, other than RGB, into NeRFs: (1) training from scratch independently on both modalities; (2) pre-training on RGB and fine-tuning on the second modality; (3) adding a second branch; and (4) adding a separate component to predict (color) values of the additional modality. We chose thermal imaging as second modality since it strongly differs from RGB in terms of radiosity, making it challenging to integrate into neural scene representations. For the evaluation of the proposed strategies, we captured a new publicly available multi-view dataset, ThermalMix, consisting of six common objects and about 360 RGB and thermal images in total. We employ cross-modality calibration prior to data capturing, leading to high-quality alignments between RGB and thermal images. Our findings reveal that adding a second branch to NeRF performs best for novel view synthesis on thermal images while also yielding compelling results on RGB. Finally, we also show that our analysis generalizes to other modalities, including near-infrared images and depth maps. Project page: https://mert-o.github.io/ThermalNeRF/.</description>
