      <title>Variational Autoencoder for Personalized Pathological Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalizability of speech enhancement (SE) models across speaker conditions remains largely unexplored, despite its critical importance for broader applicability. This paper investigates the performance of the hybrid variational autoencoder (VAE)-non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model for SE, focusing primarily on its generalizability to pathological speakers with Parkinson's disease. We show that VAE models trained on large neurotypical datasets perform poorly on pathological speech. While fine-tuning these pre-trained models with pathological speech improves performance, a performance gap remains between neurotypical and pathological speakers. To address this gap, we propose using personalized SE models derived from fine-tuning pre-trained models with only a few seconds of clean data from each speaker. Our results demonstrate that personalized models considerably enhance performance for all speakers, achieving comparable results for both neurotypical and pathological speakers.</description>

      <title>Room Impulse Response Estimation through Optimal Mass Transport Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of jointly estimating a set of room impulse responses (RIRs) corresponding to closely spaced microphones. The accurate estimation of RIRs is crucial in acoustic applications such as speech enhancement, noise cancellation, and auralization. However, real-world constraints such as short excitation signals, low signal-to-noise ratios, and poor spectral excitation, often render the estimation problem ill-posed. In this paper, we address these challenges by means of optimal mass transport (OMT) regularization. In particular, we propose to use an OMT barycenter, or generalized mean, as a mechanism for information sharing between the microphones. This allows us to quantify and exploit similarities in the delay-structures between the different microphones without having to impose rigid assumptions on the room acoustics. The resulting estimator is formulated in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem which can be implemented using standard solvers. In numerical examples, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in addressing otherwise ill-conditioned estimation scenarios.</description>

      <title>MoonCast: High-Quality Zero-Shot Podcast Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis have achieved notable success in generating high-quality short utterances for individual speakers. However, these systems still face challenges when extending their capabilities to long, multi-speaker, and spontaneous dialogues, typical of real-world scenarios such as podcasts. These limitations arise from two primary challenges: 1) long speech: podcasts typically span several minutes, exceeding the upper limit of most existing work; 2) spontaneity: podcasts are marked by their spontaneous, oral nature, which sharply contrasts with formal, written contexts; existing works often fall short in capturing this spontaneity. In this paper, we propose MoonCast, a solution for high-quality zero-shot podcast generation, aiming to synthesize natural podcast-style speech from text-only sources (e.g., stories, technical reports, news in TXT, PDF, or Web URL formats) using the voices of unseen speakers. To generate long audio, we adopt a long-context language model-based audio modeling approach utilizing large-scale long-context speech data. To enhance spontaneity, we utilize a podcast generation module to generate scripts with spontaneous details, which have been empirically shown to be as crucial as the text-to-speech modeling itself. Experiments demonstrate that MoonCast outperforms baselines, with particularly notable improvements in spontaneity and coherence.</description>

      <title>AdaST: Dynamically Adapting Encoder States in the Decoder for End-to-End Speech-to-Text Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In end-to-end speech translation, acoustic representations learned by the encoder are usually fixed and static, from the perspective of the decoder, which is not desirable for dealing with the cross-modal and cross-lingual challenge in speech translation. In this paper, we show the benefits of varying acoustic states according to decoder hidden states and propose an adaptive speech-to-text translation model that is able to dynamically adapt acoustic states in the decoder. We concatenate the acoustic state and target word embedding sequence and feed the concatenated sequence into subsequent blocks in the decoder. In order to model the deep interaction between acoustic states and target hidden states, a speech-text mixed attention sublayer is introduced to replace the conventional cross-attention network. Experiment results on two widely-used datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art neural speech translation models.</description>

      <title>TCSinger: Zero-Shot Singing Voice Synthesis with Style Transfer and Multi-Level Style Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15977v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) with style transfer and style control aims to generate high-quality singing voices with unseen timbres and styles (including singing method, emotion, rhythm, technique, and pronunciation) from audio and text prompts. However, the multifaceted nature of singing styles poses a significant challenge for effective modeling, transfer, and control. Furthermore, current SVS models often fail to generate singing voices rich in stylistic nuances for unseen singers. To address these challenges, we introduce TCSinger, the first zero-shot SVS model for style transfer across cross-lingual speech and singing styles, along with multi-level style control. Specifically, TCSinger proposes three primary modules: 1) the clustering style encoder employs a clustering vector quantization model to stably condense style information into a compact latent space; 2) the Style and Duration Language Model (S\&amp;D-LM) concurrently predicts style information and phoneme duration, which benefits both; 3) the style adaptive decoder uses a novel mel-style adaptive normalization method to generate singing voices with enhanced details. Experimental results show that TCSinger outperforms all baseline models in synthesis quality, singer similarity, and style controllability across various tasks, including zero-shot style transfer, multi-level style control, cross-lingual style transfer, and speech-to-singing style transfer. Singing voice samples can be accessed at https://aaronz345.github.io/TCSingerDemo/.</description>

      <title>Information and motor constraints shape melodic diversity across cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of possible melodies is unfathomably large, yet despite this virtually unlimited potential for melodic variation, melodies from different societies can be surprisingly similar. The motor constraint hypothesis accounts for certain similarities, such as scalar motion and contour shape, but not for other major common features, such as repetition, song length, and scale size. Here we investigate the role of information constraints arising from limitations on human memory in shaping these hallmarks of melodies. We measure determinants of information rate in 62 corpora of Folk melodies spanning several continents, finding multiple trade-offs that all act to constrain the information rate across societies. By contrast, 39 corpora of Art music from Europe (including Turkey) show longer, more complex melodies, and increased complexity over time, suggesting different cultural-evolutionary selection pressures in Art and Folk music, possibly due to the use of written versus oral transmission. Our parameter-free model predicts the empirical scale degree distribution using information constraints on scalar motion, melody length, and, most importantly, information rate. This provides strong evidence that information constraints during cultural transmission of music limit the number of notes in a scale, and proposes that preference for intermediate melodic complexity is a fundamental constraint on the cultural evolution of melody.</description>

      <title>MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10496v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become more prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models. Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the model's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music understanding systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer for Underwater Acoustic Classification Using Pre-trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning is commonly employed to leverage large, pre-trained models and perform fine-tuning for downstream tasks. The most prevalent pre-trained models are initially trained using ImageNet. However, their ability to generalize can vary across different data modalities. This study compares pre-trained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) and ImageNet pre-trained models within the context of underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR). It was observed that the ImageNet pre-trained models slightly out-perform pre-trained audio models in passive sonar classification. We also analyzed the impact of audio sampling rates for model pre-training and fine-tuning. This study contributes to transfer learning applications of UATR, illustrating the potential of pre-trained models to address limitations caused by scarce, labeled data in the UATR domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While deep learning has reduced the prevalence of manual feature extraction, transformation of data via feature engineering remains essential for improving model performance, particularly for underwater acoustic signals. The methods by which audio signals are converted into time-frequency representations and the subsequent handling of these spectrograms can significantly impact performance. This work demonstrates the performance impact of using different combinations of time-frequency features in a histogram layer time delay neural network. An optimal set of features is identified with results indicating that specific feature combinations outperform single data features.</description>

      <title>CodecFake+: A Large-Scale Neural Audio Codec-Based Deepfake Speech Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of neural audio codecs, codec-based speech generation (CoSG) systems have become highly powerful. Unfortunately, CoSG also enables the creation of highly realistic deepfake speech, making it easier to mimic an individual's voice and spread misinformation. We refer to this emerging deepfake speech generated by CoSG systems as CodecFake. Detecting such CodecFake is an urgent challenge, yet most existing systems primarily focus on detecting fake speech generated by traditional speech synthesis models. In this paper, we introduce CodecFake+, a large-scale dataset designed to advance CodecFake detection. To our knowledge, CodecFake+ is the largest dataset encompassing the most diverse range of codec architectures. The training set is generated through re-synthesis using 31 publicly available open-source codec models, while the evaluation set includes web-sourced data from 17 advanced CoSG models. We also propose a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes codecs by their root components: vector quantizer, auxiliary objectives, and decoder types. Our proposed dataset and taxonomy enable detailed analysis at multiple levels to discern the key factors for successful CodecFake detection. At the individual codec level, we validate the effectiveness of using codec re-synthesized speech (CoRS) as training data for large-scale CodecFake detection. At the taxonomy level, we show that detection performance is strongest when the re-synthesis model incorporates disentanglement auxiliary objectives or a frequency-domain decoder. Furthermore, from the perspective of using all the CoRS training data, we show that our proposed taxonomy can be used to select better training data for improving detection performance. Overall, we envision that CodecFake+ will be a valuable resource for both general and fine-grained exploration to develop better anti-spoofing models against CodecFake.</description>

      <title>An LLM Benchmark for Addressee Recognition in Multi-modal Multi-party Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Handling multi-party dialogues represents a significant step for advancing spoken dialogue systems, necessitating the development of tasks specific to multi-party interactions. To address this challenge, we are constructing a multi-modal multi-party dialogue corpus of triadic (three-participant) discussions. This paper focuses on the task of addressee recognition, identifying who is being addressed to take the next turn, a critical component unique to multi-party dialogue systems. A subset of the corpus was annotated with addressee information, revealing that explicit addressees are indicated in approximately 20% of conversational turns. To evaluate the task's complexity, we benchmarked the performance of a large language model (GPT-4o) on addressee recognition. The results showed that GPT-4o achieved an accuracy only marginally above chance, underscoring the challenges of addressee recognition in multi-party dialogue. These findings highlight the need for further research to enhance the capabilities of large language models in understanding and navigating the intricacies of multi-party conversational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Latent Swap Joint Diffusion for 2D Long-Form Latent Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\sim$ 20 $\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability.

      <title>Prosody-Enhanced Acoustic Pre-training and Acoustic-Disentangled Prosody Adapting for Movie Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movie dubbing describes the process of transforming a script into speech that aligns temporally and emotionally with a given movie clip while exemplifying the speaker's voice demonstrated in a short reference audio clip. This task demands the model bridge character performances and complicated prosody structures to build a high-quality video-synchronized dubbing track. The limited scale of movie dubbing datasets, along with the background noise inherent in audio data, hinder the acoustic modeling performance of trained models. To address these issues, we propose an acoustic-prosody disentangled two-stage method to achieve high-quality dubbing generation with precise prosody alignment. First, we propose a prosody-enhanced acoustic pre-training to develop robust acoustic modeling capabilities. Then, we freeze the pre-trained acoustic system and design a disentangled framework to model prosodic text features and dubbing style while maintaining acoustic quality. Additionally, we incorporate an in-domain emotion analysis module to reduce the impact of visual domain shifts across different movies, thereby enhancing emotion-prosody alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art models on two primary benchmarks. The demos are available at https://zzdoog.github.io/ProDubber/.</description>
