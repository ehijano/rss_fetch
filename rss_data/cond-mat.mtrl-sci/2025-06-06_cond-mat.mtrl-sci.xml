      <title>Magnetophoresis of paramagnetic nanoparticles in suspensions under magnetic field gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the magnetophoresis of weakly paramagnetic manganese oxide nanoparticles under nonuniform magnetic fields using a combination of experiments and multiphysics numerical simulations. Experiments were conducted in a closed cuvette exposed to a nonuniform magnetic field generated by an electromagnet, covering a wide range of particle concentrations 25-200 mgL and magnetic field gradients 0-110 T2m. The experimental results reveal that paramagnetic manganese oxide nanoparticles exhibit significant magnetophoretic behavior, leading to particle depletion within the cuvette. The depletion rate is independent of the initial particle concentration but strongly depends on the magnetic field gradient. At low magnetic field gradients, magnetophoresis progresses slowly, while at higher gradients, the particle depletion rate increases significantly before stabilizing. Transient concentration gradients emerge within the cuvette during magnetophoresis, which we hypothesize are driven by magnetic Grashof numbers near unity. When magnetic Grashof is beyond 1, the formation of concentration gradients induces bulk fluid flows that accelerate particle capture at regions of maximum magnetic field strength. In systems where magnetophoresis opposes sedimentation, particle depleted regions form when the ratio of magnetic to gravitational Peclet numbers exceeds 1. The numerical simulations suggest formation field induced aggregation for manganese oxide nanoparticles with radii of 130 nm or larger. These insights highlight the potential of magnetic separation for sustainable metal recovery, offering a scalable and environmental friendly solution for recycling critical materials from spent electronics.</description>

      <title>Substrate pre-sputtering for layer-by-layer van der Waals epitaxy of 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal chalcogenides, with their atomically layered structure, favourable electronic and mechanical properties, and often strong spin-orbit coupling, are ideal systems for fundamental studies and for applications ranging from spintronics to optoelectronics. Their bottom-up synthesis via epitaxial techniques such as molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) has, however, proved challenging. Here, we develop a simple substrate pre-treatment process utilising exposure to a low-energy noble gas plasma. We show how this dramatically enhances nucleation of an MBE-grown epilayer atop, and through this, realise a true layer-by-layer growth mode. We further demonstrate the possibility of tuning the resulting growth dynamics via control of the species and dose of the plasma exposure.</description>

      <title>Substrate matters: Coupled phonon modes of a spherical particle on a substrate probed with EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using vibrational electron energy loss spectroscopy (vib-EELS) combined with numerical modeling, we investigate the physical mechanisms governing the phonon coupling between a spherical particle sustaining multipolar surface phonon modes and an underlying thin film. Depending upon their dielectric composition, a variety of hybrid phonon modes arise in the EEL spectrum due to the interaction between polarization charges in the particle and film. Mirror charge effects and phonon mode hybridization are the active mechanisms acting on dielectric and metallic-type films, respectively. Processes beyond dipole-dipole interactions are required to describe the sphere-film coupling.</description>

      <title>Enhanced strain rate sensitivity due to platelet linear complexions in Al-Cu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platelet array linear complexions have been predicted in Al-Cu, with notable features being dislocation faceting and climb into the precipitate, both of which should impact plasticity. In this study, we examine the strain rate dependence of strength for platelet linear complexions using atomistic simulations, with classical precipitate strengthening through particle cutting and particle bowing used as baseline comparisons. Dislocation segments with edge character must climb down from the platelet structures prior to the commencement of glide, introducing a significant time-dependent barrier to plastic deformation. Consequently, the strain rate sensitivity of strength for the platelet linear complexions system was found to be up to five times higher than that of classical precipitation strengthening mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Direct Joule-Heated Non-Equilibrium Synthesis Enables High Performing Thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput synthesis of bulk inorganic materials is crucial for accelerating functional materials discovery but is hindered by slow, energy-intensive solid-state methods. We introduce Direct Joule-Heated Synthesis (DJS), a rapid, single-step and scalable solid-state synthesis technique achieving a $10^5$-fold speedup and 20,000x energy efficiency improvement over conventional synthesis. DJS enables the synthesis of dense, bulk chalcogenides ($\mathrm{Bi_{0.5}Sb_{1.5}Te_3}$, $\mathrm{AgSbTe_2}$), achieving a zT of 2.3 at 573 K in optimally Cd/Se co-doped $\mathrm{AgSbTe_2}$, one of the highest for polycrystalline materials at this temperature. DJS enables optimal co-doping and rapid, non-equilibrium solidification, producing lamellar microstructures, interfacial regions, and cation-ordered nanodomains that scatter all-scale phonons, achieving ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (~0.2 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 573 K). DJS establishes a new benchmark for scalable and fast synthesis, accelerating functional material discovery.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Energy Gradients Drive Coalescence of Supported Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling nanoparticle coalescence is crucial for applications ranging from catalysis to nanodevice fabrication, yet the behavior of nanoparticles on dynamically evolving, heterogeneous substrates remains poorly understood. Here, we employ in situ transmission electron microscopy to investigate platinum (Pt) nanoparticle dynamics on silicon nitride (SiN$_x$) substrates where localized crystalline silicon (Si) nanodomains are deliberately formed via electron beam irradiation at $800^\circ$C. We observe that Pt nanoparticles in contact with these Si pads transform into a more mobile platinum silicide (Pt$_3$Si) phase. Strikingly, these Pt$_3$Si nanoparticles exhibit pronounced directional migration away from the Si pads, driven by interfacial energy gradients, rather than undergoing stochastic Brownian motion. This directed movement fundamentally dictates coalescence pathways, leading to either enhanced sintering when particles are channeled together or inhibited coalescence when Si pads act as repulsive barriers. Our findings reveal that local substrate chemistry and the resulting interfacial energy landscapes can dominate over initial particle size or proximity in controlling solid-state nanoparticle migration and assembly. This work provides insights into how substrate heterogeneity can be used to direct nanoparticle behavior, challenging conventional coalescence models and offering pathways for the rational design of supported nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Neural Object Detection for 4D STEM: High-Throughput Sub-Pixel Electron Diffraction Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput analysis of multidimensional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) datasets remains a significant challenge, limiting the broader impact on strategic materials research. Conventional workflows typically involve sequential, modular processing steps that necessitate extensive manual intervention and offline parameter tuning. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end post-processing framework for large-scale four-dimensional scanning TEM (4D-STEM) datasets, built around a highly efficient neural network-based object detection model. Central to our method is a sub-pixel accurate object center localization algorithm, which serves as the foundation for high-precision and high-throughput analysis of electron diffraction patterns. We demonstrate a strain measurement precision of 5x$10^{-4}$, quantified by the standard deviation of strain values within the strain-free Si substrate of a Si/SiGe multilayer TEM sample. Furthermore, by implementing an asynchronous, non-blocking object detection workflow, we achieve speeds exceeding 100 frames per second (fps), substantially accelerating the crystallographic phase identification and strain mapping in complex multiphase metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Derivation of a non-stoichiometric 1/1 quasicrystal approximant from a stoichiometric 2/1 quasicrystal approximant and maximization of magnetocaloric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present research introduces a novel strategy for tuning magnetic properties by overcoming the compositional limitation of stoichiometric intermetallic compounds via extension of their stability into a new dimension within valence electron-per-atom (e/a) parameter space. Focusing on approximant crystals (ACs), a "double hetero-valent elemental substitution" is employed in a stoichiometric Ga-Pt-Gd 2/1 AC whereby e/a is lowered from 1.92 to 1.60. Through this approach a new family of stable Ga-based Tsai-type 1/1 ACs with exceptionally wide composition stability within e/a space is derived. Remarkably, magnetic ground state is altered from initially spin-glass to ferromagnetic (FM) with second order phase transition and mean-field-like critical behavior. More importantly, through this strategy, the isothermal magnetic entropy change enhanced significantly and reached a maximum value of -8.7 J/K mol-Gd under a 5 T magnetic field change, even comparable to leading rare-earth magnetocaloric materials including RCo2 phases. These findings demonstrate the high potential of a double hetero-valent elemental substitution for tailoring magnetic properties and magnetocaloric response in stoichiometric compounds, offering a new pathway for designing high-performance magnetic refrigeration materials even beyond the quasicrystals and ACs.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Stub Length Influence on Dispersion Relations and Parity Effect in Aharonov-Bohm Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aharonov-Bohm (AB) rings with side-attached stubs are model systems for quantum-interference studies in mesoscopic physics. The geometry of such systems, particularly the ratio of stub length ($v$) to ring circumference ($u$), can significantly alter their electronic states. In this work, we solve Deo's transcendental mode-condition equation (Eq. 2.15 from Deo, 2021 [Deo2021]) numerically -- using Python's NumPy and SciPy libraries -- for ring-stub geometries with $v/u = 0.200, 0.205,$ and $0.210$ to generate dispersion relations ($ku$ vs. $\Phi/\Phi_{0}$) and the underlying function $\text{Re}(1/T)$. We find that changing $v/u$ shifts several of the six lowest calculated dispersion branches, with $\Delta(ku)$ up to approximately $0.34$ for the 6th branch at $\Phi=0$ when comparing $v/u=0.200$ and $v/u=0.210$. This also alters gap widths. Notably, for $v/u=0.205$ and $v/u=0.210$, the 5th and 6th consecutive calculated modes both exhibit paramagnetic slopes near zero Aharonov-Bohm flux, indicating the parity breakdown initiates at or below $v/u=0.205$. This directly demonstrates a breakdown of the simple alternating parity effect predicted by Deo (2021) [Deo2021]. These results highlight the sensitivity of mesoscopic ring spectra to fine-tuning of stub length, with potential implications for experimental control of persistent currents, as further illustrated by calculations of the net current.</description>

      <title>Tip-induced nitrene generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generated trinitreno-s-heptazine, a small molecule featuring three nitrene centers, by tip-induced chemistry from the precursor 2,5,8-triazido-s-heptazine on bilayer NaCl on Au(111). The precursor's azide groups were dissociated to form mono-, di- and trinitreno-s-heptazine, yielding molecules with one to three nitrene centers. The precursor and its products are characterized by atomic force microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy. Broken-symmetry DFT and configuration interaction calculations of inter- and intra-nitrene exchange couplings suggest a ferromagnetic coupling of the S = 1 nitrene centers, resulting in a high-spin septet ground state for neutral trinitreno-s-heptazine in the gas phase. On bilayer NaCl on Au(111), the combined results of experiments and theory suggest trinitreno-s-heptazine to be an anion with a sextet ground state.</description>

      <title>Revisiting cofactor conditions: Elimination of transition layers in compound domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conditions necessary for the elimination of transition layers at interfaces involving compound domains, extending the classical framework of cofactor conditions. Although cofactor conditions enable stress-free phase boundaries between Type I/II domains and austenite, their applicability to compound domains has remained limited. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to characterize all compatible interfaces, highlighting the fundamental importance of the commutation property among martensitic variants. By establishing necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions, referred to as extreme compatibility conditions, we demonstrate the simultaneous elimination of transition layers at phase interfaces for both Type I/II and compound laminates, across all volume fractions of the martensitic variants. We also investigate the possibility of achieving supercompatibility in non-conventional twins, recently observed in the NiMnGa system. The focus of our work is on cubic-to-orthorhombic and cubic-to-monoclinic~II phase transformations, for which the extreme compatibility conditions are explicitly derived and systematically analyzed. The theory predicts novel zero-elastic-energy microstructures, including an increased number of triple clusters, spearhead-shaped martensitic nuclei, stress-free inclusions of austenite within martensite, and distinctive four-fold martensitic clusters. This significantly expands the possible modes of forming stress-free interfaces between phases and reveals new energy-minimizing microstructures that can facilitate the nucleation of martensite within austenite and vice versa. These configurations highlight significant enhancements in transformation reversibility and material durability, guiding the rational design of next-generation shape memory alloys with optimized functional properties.</description>

      <title>Strongly enhanced topological quantum phases in dual-surface AlO$_x$-encapsulated MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological quantum phases in antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ hold promise for next-generation spintronics, but their experimental realization has been constrained by challenges in preparing high-quality devices. In this work, we report a new wax-assisted exfoliation and transfer method that enables the fabrication of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ heterostructures with both surfaces encapsulated by AlO$_x$. This strategy strongly enhances the topological quantum phases in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ flakes. We observe the robust axion insulator state in even-layer device with wide zero Hall plateau and high longitudinal resistivity, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect in odd-layer device with large hysteresis and sharp plateau transition. These results demonstrate that the combination of wax exfoliation and AlO$_x$ encapsulation provides great potentials for exploring novel topological quantum phenomena and potential applications in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and other two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Identification of the high-pressure phases of alpha-SnWO4 combining x-ray diffraction and crystal structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have characterized the high-pressure behavior of alpha-SnWO4. The compound has been studied up to 30 GPa using a diamond-anvil cell and synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. We report evidence of two structural phase transitions in the pressure range covered in our study, and we propose a crystal structure for the two high-pressure phases. The first one, observed around 12.9 GPa, has been obtained combining indexation using DICVOL and density-functional theory calculations. The second high-pressure phase, observed around 17.5 GPa, has been determined by using the CALYPSO code, the prediction of which was supported by a Le Bail fit to the experimental X-ray diffraction patterns. The proposed structural sequence involves two successive collapses of the unit-cell volume and an increase in the coordination number of Sn and W atoms. The room-temperature equations of state, the principal axes of compression and their compressibility, the elastic constants, and the elastic moduli are reported for {\alpha}-SnWO4 and for the two high-pressure phases.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast generation of coherent soft-shear phonons in halide perovskites via anisotropic photostriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical generation of transverse coherent phonons by femtosecond light pulses is appealing for high-speed sub-THz active control of material properties. Lead-free double perovskite semiconductors, such as Cs2AgBiBr6, attract particular interest due to their cubic to tetragonal phase transition below room temperature and strong polaron effects from carrier-lattice coupling. Here, we reveal that the anisotropic photostriction in halide perovskites with tetragonal crystal structure represents an efficient non-thermal tool for generating transverse coherent phonons. In particular, we demonstrate that along with compressive strain, optical generation of photoexcited carriers leads to strong shear strain in Cs2AgBiBr6 below the phase transition temperature of 122 K. Using time-domain Brillouin spectroscopy, we observe coherent transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons with comparable amplitudes in the tetragonal phase, while in the cubic phase only longitudinal phonons are generated. The polarization of the photoinduced transverse phonons is dictated by the projection of the c-axis on the surface plane, which leads to a prominent anisotropic polarization response in the detection. The generated strain pulses correspond to transverse acoustic soft eigenmodes with a strong temperature dependence of dispersion, which provides an additional degree of freedom for active hypersonic control.</description>

      <title>Opposite pressure effects on magnetic phase transitions in NiBr2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NiBr2, similar to NiI2, exhibits the onset of collinear antiferromagnetism at a subroom temperature and, with further cooling, undergoes a transition to a helimagnetic ordering associated with multiferroic behavior. This work investigates the hydrostatic pressure effects on magnetic phase transitions in NiBr2. We measured isobaric temperature dependencies of AC magnetic susceptibility at various pressures up to 3 GPa. The experimental data are interpreted in conjunction with the results of theoretical calculations focused on pressure influence on the hierarchy of exchange interactions. Contrary to the NiI2 case, the phase transition to helimagnetism rapidly shifts to lower temperatures with increasing pressure. Similar to the NiI2, the Neel temperature increases with pressure. The rate of increase accelerates when the helimagnetic phase is suppressed by pressure. The ab initio calculations link these contrasting trends to pressure-enhanced magnetic exchange interactions. Similarly to the NiI2 case, the stabilization of the collinear AFM phase is driven primarily by the second-nearest interlayer coupling (j2'). Furthermore, the ratio of in-plane interactions makes helimagnetic order in NiBr2 much more volatile, which permits its suppression with already small pressures. These findings highlight the principal role of interlayer interactions in the distinct response of NiBr2 and NiI2 magnetic phases to external pressure.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Decomposition of beta-SnWO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reports the decomposition of beta-SnWO4 into Sn, SnO2, and WO3 induced by static compression. We performed high-pressure synchrotron powder angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction measurements and found that decomposition occurs at a pressure of 13.97(5) GPa and is irreversible. This result contradicts a previous study that, based on density-functional theory calculations and crystal-chemistry arguments, predicted a pressure-driven transition from beta-SnWO4 to alpha-SnWO4. Our analysis indicates that the observed decomposition is unrelated to mechanical or dynamic instabilities. Instead, it likely stems from frustration of the beta-alpha transition, as this transformation requires a change in Sn coordination from octahedral to tetrahedral. The assessment of how pressure influences the volume of the unit cell provided an accurate determination of the room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state for beta-SnWO4. Furthermore, the elastic constants and moduli, as well as the pressure dependence of Raman and infrared modes of beta-SnWO4, were derived from density-functional theory calculations. Several phonon modes exhibited softening, and three cases of phonon anti-crossing were observed.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into Water-Splitting, Proton Migration, and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in g-C3N4/TiO2-B and Li-F co-doped Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar water splitting has received a lot of attention due to its high efficiency and clean energy production potential. Herein, based on the band alignment principle, the g-C3N4/TiO2-B(001) heterostructure is strategically designed, then a Li-F co-doping approach is developed and implemented, leading to significant enhancement in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of the heterostructure systems. The decomposition of water molecule on the surface of heterostructures, the migration and diffusion of proton across the interface, and the hydrogen evolution performance are systematically studied and comprehensively analyzed. The results demonstrate that the heterojunction surface exhibits a relatively low energy barrier for water decomposition, facilitating both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Proton transfer preferentially occurs from the TiO2-B(001) surface to the g-C3N4 surface through the interface. The presence of polar covalent bonds establishes a substantial energy barrier for proton migration from TiO2-B(001) surface to the interface, representing a rate-determining factor in the hydrogen evolution process. The formation of hydrogen bonds significantly reduces the migration energy barrier for protons crossing the interface to the g-C3N4 surface. Hydrogen adsorption free energy analysis show that that the heterojunction surface exhibits optimal proton adsorption and desorption characteristics. The synergistic combination of low water decomposition energy barrier, reduced proton migration energy barriers and exceptional HER performance endows both g-C3N4/TiO2-B(001) heterostructure and Li-F co-doped g-C3N4/TiO2-B(001) heterojunction with remarkbale potential as efficient HER photocatalyst.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Dissipation in Ferrofluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrofluids, composed of magnetic nanoparticles suspended in a non-magnetic carrier liquid, have attracted considerable attention since their discovery in the 1960s. Their combination of liquid and magnetic properties gives rise to complex behaviors and unique functionalities, enabling a wide range of technological applications. Among these is the ability of the magnetic material to be moved by and to absorb heat when exposed to an external magnetic field -- a process that can occur through various dissipation mechanisms depending on the system. A detailed understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for tailoring materials to specific applications. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical principles underlying different energy dissipation processes and propose a coherent framework for their interpretation. Particular attention is devoted to describing the frequency-dependent susceptibility, which is the key parameter to describe dissipation. We demonstrate that dissipation, predicted from magnetometry-based studies, matches well with direct, frequency-dependent calorimetric results, expanding the available frequency range of the characterization. The demonstrating measurements were carried out with a dilute ferrofluid containing magnetite nanoparticles of a mean diameter of 10.6 nm.</description>

      <title>How does picosecond structural deformation of (Ba,Sr)TiO$_{3}$ relate to the pyroelectric effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pyroelectric effect in ferroelectric thin films is typically composed of different contributions, which are difficult to disentangle. In addition, clamping to the substrate interface plays an important role. We studied epitaxial (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ thin films grown on NdScO$_3$ to see if time-resolved measurements can shed more light on the complex interaction. In particular, we compare standard measurements of the pyroelectric coefficient by temperature-dependent hysteresis loops to transient deformation measurements on picosecond timescales in the same material. The advantage of the time-resolved approach lies in its increased sensitivity in thin films compared to that of polarization hysteresis measurements. Whereas a fast thermal expansion of the ferroelectric thin film was observed after femtosecond laser excitation of the intermediate SrRuO$_3$ layer, heat diffusion simulations reveal frustration of the thermal expansion, which might be explained with the charge dynamics at the Schottky barrier formed at the SrRuO$_3$/(Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. More studies are required to quantitatively assess the individual contributions to the pyroelectric coefficient of the materials used in our layer architecture.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast magneto-lattice dynamics in two-dimensional CrSBr driven by terahertz excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) lasers provide a new research perspective for spin electronics applications due to their sub-picosecond time resolution and non-thermal ultrafast demagnetization, but the interaction between spin, charge and lattice dynamics remains unclear. This study investigates photoinduced ultrafast demagnetization in monolayer CrSBr, a two-dimensional material with strong spin-orbit and spin-lattice coupling, and resolves its demagnetization process. Two key stages are identified: the first, occurring within 20 fs, is characterized by rapid electron-driven demagnetization, where charge transfer and THz laser are strongly coupled. In the second stage, light-induced lattice vibrations coupled to spin dynamics lead to significant spin changes, with electron-phonon coupling playing a key role. Importantly, the role of various phonon vibration modes in the electron relaxation process was clearly determined, pointing out that the electronic relaxation of the B3g1 phonon vibration mode occurs within 83 fs, which is less than the commonly believed 100 fs. Moreover, the influence of this coherent phonon on the demagnetization change is as high as 215 %. These insights into multiscale magneto-structural coupling advance the understanding of nonequilibrium spin dynamics and provide guidelines for the design of light-controlled quantum devices, particularly in layered heterostructures for spintronics and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Bilayer triple-Q state driven by interlayer higher-order exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations and an atomistic spin model we predict the stabilization of a bilayer triple-Q state in an atomic Mn bilayer on Ir(111) due to interlayer higher-order exchange interactions. Based on density functional theory (DFT) we study the magnetic interactions and ground state in a Mn monolayer and bilayer on the Ir(111) surface. We calculate the energy dispersion of spin spirals (single-Q states) to scan a large part of the magnetic phase space and to obtain constants of pair-wise exchange interactions. By including spin-orbit coupling we determine the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. To reveal the role of higher-order exchange interactions in these films, we consider multi-Q states obtained by a superposition of spin spirals. For the Mn monolayer in fcc stacking on Ir(111), the triple-Q state exhibits the lowest total energy in DFT, while the N\'eel state is most favorable for hcp stacking. For the Mn bilayer on Ir(111), two types of the triple-Q state are possible. In both magnetic configurations, a triple-Q state occurs within each of the Mn layers. However, only in one of them the spin alignment between the layers is such that nearest-neighbor spins of different layers also exhibit the tetrahedron angles which characterize the triple-Q state. We denote this state -- which has the lowest total energy in our DFT calculations -- as the ideal bilayer triple-Q state. This state exhibits significant topological orbital moments within each of the two Mn layers which are aligned in parallel resulting in a large topological orbital magnetization. We interpret the DFT results within an atomistic spin model which includes pair-wise Heisenberg exchange, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, as well as higher-order exchange interactions....</description>

      <title>Classification and enumeration of solid-solid phase transition mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal-structure match (CSM), the atom-to-atom correspondence between two crystalline phases, is used extensively to describe solid-solid phase transition (SSPT) mechanisms. However, existing computational methods cannot account for all possible CSMs. Here, we propose a formalism to classify all CSMs into a tree structure, which is independent of the choices of unit cell and supercell. We rigorously proved that only a finite number of noncongruent CSMs are of practical interest. By representing CSMs as integer matrices, we introduce the crystmatch method to exhaustively enumerate them, which uncontroversially solves the CSM optimization problem under any geometric criterion. For most SSPTs, crystmatch can reproduce all known deformation mechanisms and CSMs within 10 CPU minutes, while also revealing thousands of new candidates. The resulting database can be further used for comparing experimental phenomena, high-throughput energy barrier calculations, or machine learning.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Metallicity in {\AA}ngstr\"om-Thickness 2D Bismuth and Layer-Selective Ohmic Contact to MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) metallic bismuth (Bi) via van der Waals (vdW) squeezing method opens a new avenue to ultrascaling metallic materials into the {\aa}ngstr\"om-thickness regime [Nature 639, 354 (2025)]. However, freestanding 2D Bi is typically known to exhibit a semiconducting phase [Nature 617, 67 (2023), Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 236801 (2023)], which contradicts with the experimentally observed metallicity in vdW-squeezed 2D Bi. Here we show that such discrepancy originates from the pressure-induced buckled-to-flat structural transition in 2D Bi, which changes the electronic structure from semiconducting to metallic phases. Based on the experimentally fabricated MoS2-Bi-MoS2 trilayer heterostructure, we demonstrate the concept of layer-selective Ohmic contact in which one MoS2 layer forms Ohmic contact to the sandwiched Bi monolayer while the opposite MoS2 layer exhibits a Schottky barrier. The Ohmic contact can be switched between the two sandwiching MoS2 monolayers by changing the polarity of an external gate field, thus enabling charge to be spatially injected into different MoS2 layers. The layer-selective Ohmic contact proposed here represents a layertronic generalization of metal/semiconductor contact, paving a way towards layertronic device application.</description>

      <title>Designer polyradical nanographenes with strong spin entanglement and perturbation resilience via Clar's goblet extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyradical nanographenes featuring strong spin entanglement and robust many-body spin states against external magnetic perturbations not only enable the exploration of correlated quantum magnetism at the molecular scale, but also constitute promising candidates for developing molecular qubits with chemical tunability and building scalable quantum networks. Here, we employed a predictive design strategy to achieve the on-surface synthesis of two homologues of Clar goblet, C62H22 and C76H26, via lateral and vertical extensions of the parent structure, respectively. Vertical extension increases the number of topologically frustrated zero-energy modes, which scale linearly with the total number of benzene ring rows. In contrast, the lateral extension enhances electron-electron interactions, leading to the emergence of additional radical states beyond those predicted by the topological zero-energy modes. Consequently, both structures exhibit correlated tetraradical character and a many-body singlet ground state as confirmed by multireference theoretical calculations. These magnetic states arise from unique magnetic origins and also display distinct resilience to external perturbations, which can be experimentally validated using nickelocene-functionalized scanning probe techniques. Our work presents a general strategy for rational design of highly entangled polyradical nanographenes with tunable spin numbers and resilience of their many-body spin states to perturbations, opening exciting possibilities for exploring novel correlated spin phases in molecular systems and advancing quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Exciton-Exciton Annihilation Mediated by Many-Body Coulomb and Phonon Interactions: An Ab Initio Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA), in which two excitons interact to generate high-energy excitations, is an important non-radiative channel in light-induced excited-state relaxation. When efficient, this process offers an alternative route to exciton emission, potentially allowing extended energetically excited particles' lifetime and coherence. These properties are significant in designing and understanding materials-based quantum devices, particularly for low-dimensional semiconductors. Here, we present a first-principles framework to compute EEA mechanisms and rates using many-body perturbation theory within the GW and Bethe-Salpeter Equation (GW-BSE) formalism. Our method explicitly accounts for Coulomb-driven and phonon-assisted exciton-exciton scattering by explicitly evaluating the interaction channels between the constituent electrons and holes composing the BSE excitons. We apply this framework to monolayer WSe$_2$ and explore the $A$, $B$ excitation manifolds, finding picosecond-scale annihilation between bright and dark states, cross valleys, and cross peak manifolds. These channels become allowed due to scattering into free electron-hole pairs across the Brillouin zone. Our results supply new insights into non-radiative exciton relaxation mechanisms in two-dimensional materials, providing a predictive and general tool for modeling these interactions in excitonic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of superconductivity and ferroelectricity hosts a wide range of exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we report on the observation of superconductivity in high-quality tin telluride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Unintentionally doped tin telluride undergoes a ferroelectric transition at ~100 K. The critical temperature of superconductivity increases monotonically with indium concentration. The critical field of superconductivity, however, does not follow the same behavior as critical temperature with indium concentration and exhibits a carrier-density-dependent violation of the Pauli limit. The electron-phonon coupling, from the McMillan formula, exhibits a systematic enhancement with indium concentration, suggesting a potential violation of BCS weak coupling at high indium concentrations.</description>

      <title>Om-Theory of Macroscopic Electromagnetism: Greener Vibes for Isotropy-Broken Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applicability ranges of macroscopic and microscopic electromagnetisms are opposite. While microscopic electromagnetism deals with point sources, singular fields, and discrete atomistic materials, macroscopic electromagnetism concerns smooth average distributions of sources, fields, and homogenized effective metamaterials. Greens function method - GFM - involves finding fields of point sources and applying superposition principle to find fields of distributed sources. When utilized to solve microscopic problems GFM is perfectly within the applicability range. Extension of GFM to simple macroscopic problems is convenient, but not fully logically sound, since point sources and singular fields are technically not a subject of macroscopic electromagnetism. This explains the difficulty of both finding the Greens functions and applying superposition principle in complex isotropy-broken media, which are very different from microscopic environments. In this manuscript, we lay out a path to solution of macroscopic Maxwells equations for distributed sources bypassing GFM, by introducing inverse approach and a method based on Om-potential which we describe here. To the researchers of electromagnetism this provides access to powerful analytical tools and a broad new space of solutions for Maxwells equations.</description>

      <title>Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses. While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task (chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making near-term progress.</description>

      <title>Multipurpose in situ cell design for 3D X-ray imaging of electrochemical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design of a modular multipurpose cell for monitoring the degradation of materials in extreme environments. This cell decouples the reference electrode from the working and counter electrodes, permitting precise electrochemical control and measurement reliability. The design is compatible with 4th generation synchrotron light sources, and its emphasis on modularity facilitates adaptation to different beamlines, where there may be variations in sample stage requirements and X-ray imaging techniques. Experimental tests with the novel design demonstrate its support of real-time corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement measurements under both Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) and Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating dielectric losses, structural heterogeneity, and interface imperfections is critical for improving coherence in superconducting qubits. However, most diagnostics rely on destructive electron microscopy or low-throughput millikelvin quantum measurements. Here, we demonstrate noninvasive terahertz (THz) nano-imaging/-spectroscopy of encapsulated niobium transmon qubits, revealing sidewall near-field scattering that correlates with qubit coherence. We further employ a THz hyperspectral line scan to probe dielectric responses and field participation at Al junction interfaces. These findings highlight the promise of THz near-field methods as a high-throughput proxy characterization tool for guiding material selection and optimizing processing protocols to improve qubit and quantum circuit performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive recycled plastic architecture: Vacuum-Sealed Chainmail Structures Through Computational Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction industry is a major consumer of raw materials, accounting for nearly half of global material usage annually, while generating significant waste that poses sustainability challenges. This paper explores the untapped potential of recycled plastics as a primary construction material, leveraging their lightweight, flexible, and customizable properties for advanced applications in modular chainmail systems. Through a computational workflow, the study optimizes the design, testing, and fabrication of vacuum-sealed chainmail structures composed of recycled plastic filaments, demonstrating their adaptability and structural performance for architectural use.
  Key contributions include a novel methodology for integrating recycled plastic filaments into chainmail geometries, validated through 2D sectional testing, 3D shell structure generation, and physical modeling under vacuum constraints. The research identifies the rectangular chainmail configuration as the most efficient and adaptable, achieving superior deformation capacity, material efficiency, and load-bearing performance. Optimization strategies for temporary structures highlight practical deployment potential, balancing material savings, usable area, and water drainage efficiency.
  The findings offer a foundation for innovative applications in extreme conditions, including disaster-prone areas, high-altitude environments, underwater platforms, and extraterrestrial habitats. These applications leverage the lightweight, adaptable, and durable properties of recycled plastics and modular chainmail systems, bridging the gap between waste management and high-performance design while addressing unique challenges in harsh and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Axion-mediated photon-to-photon transitions in high finesse dielectric resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical particles that could address both the strong charge-parity problem in quantum chromodynamics and the enigmatic nature of dark matter. However, if axions exist, their mass remains unknown, and they are expected to interact very weakly with the electromagnetic field, which explains why they have not been detected yet. This study proposes a way to substantially augment the axion-photon interaction by confining the photons within high-quality-factor dielectric resonators, increasing their intensity and lifetime and thus the possibility of interacting with axions in the background. In view of this, we study resonant axion-mediated photonic transitions in millimeter-sized spherical dielectric resonators, based on fully analytical calculations to the first order in perturbation theory. Such resonators exhibit high lifetime Mie resonances in the microwave part of the spectrum, with a separation that can be tailored with the radius of the sphere to match the expected axion frequency, allowing axion-mediated photonic transitions when particular selection rules are fulfilled. Such transitions are expected to be enhanced by more than ten orders of magnitude in the presence of the resonator, compared to transitions occurring in homogeneous space.</description>

      <title>Thermal Property Microscopy with Compressive Sensing Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial mapping of thermal properties is critical for unveiling the structure-property relation of materials, heterogeneous interfaces, and devices. These property images can also serve as datasets for training artificial intelligence models for material discoveries and optimization. Here we introduce a high-throughput thermal property imaging method called compressive sensing frequency domain thermoreflectance (CS-FDTR), which can robustly profile thermal property distributions with micrometer resolutions while requiring only a random subset of pixels being experimentally measured. The high-resolution thermal property image is reconstructed from the raw down-sampled data through L_1-regularized minimization. The high-throughput imaging capability of CS-FDTR is validated using the following cases: (a) the thermal conductance of a patterned heterogeneous interface, (b) thermal conductivity variations of an annealed pyrolytic graphite sample, and (c) the sharp change in thermal conductivity across a vertical aluminum/graphite interface. With less than half of the pixels being experimentally sampled, the thermal property images measured using CS-FDTR show nice agreements with the ground truth (point-by-point scanning), with a relative deviation below 15%. This work opens the possibility of high-throughput thermal property imaging without sacrificing the data quality, which is critical for materials discovery and screening.</description>

      <title>Lattice Mismatch Driven In Plane Strain Engineering for Enhanced Upper Critical Fields in Mo2N Superconducting Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal nitrides are a fascinating class of hard coating material that provide an excellent platform for investigating superconductivity and fundamental electron phonon interactions. In this work the structural morphological and superconducting properties have been studied for Mo2N thin films deposited via direct current magnetron sputtering on cplane Al2O3 and MgO substrates to elucidate the effect of internal strain on superconducting properties. High resolution X Ray diffraction and time of flight elastic recoil detection analysis confirms the growth of single phase Mo2N thin films exhibiting epitaxial growth with twin domain structure. Low temperature electrical transport measurements reveal superconducting transitions at 5.2 K and 5.6 K with corresponding upper critical fields of 5 T and 7 T for the films deposited on Al2O3 and MgO, respectively. These results indicate strong type II superconductivity and the observed differences in superconducting properties are attributed to substrate induced strain which leads to higher e ph coupling for the film on MgO substrate. These findings highlight the tunability of superconducting properties in Mo2N films through strategic substrate selection.</description>

      <title>Thermoplasmonics of Gold-Core Silica-Shell Colloidal Nanoparticles under Pulse Illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-shell nanoparticles, particularly those having a gold core, have emerged as a highly promising class of materials due to their unique optical and thermal properties, which underpin a wide range of applications in photothermal therapy, imaging, and biosensing. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the thermal dynamics of gold-core silica-shell nanoparticles immersed in water under pulse illumination. The plasmonic response of the core-shell nanoparticle is described by incorporating Mie theory with electronic temperature corrections to the refractive indices of gold, based on a Drude Lorentz formulation. The thermal response of the core-shell nanoparticles is modeled by coupling the two temperature model with molecular dynamics simulations, providing an atomistic description of nanoscale heat transfer. We investigate nanoparticles with both dense and porous silica shells (with 50% porosity) under laser pulse durations of 100 fs, 10 ps, and 1 ns, and over a range of fluences between 0.05 and 5mJ/cm2. We show that nanoparticles with a thin dense silica shell (5 nm) exhibit significantly faster water heating compared to bare gold nanoparticles. This behavior is attributed to enhanced electron-phonon coupling at the gold silica interface and to the relatively high thermal conductance between silica and water. These findings provide new insights into optimizing nanoparticle design for efficient photothermal applications and establish a robust framework for understanding energy transfer mechanisms in heterogeneous metal dielectric nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Organic Crystal Active Waveguide as an All-Angle Signal Receiver and Transmission Platform for Visible Light Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic crystal waveguides, known for excellent light-guiding and photonic versatility, present a promising alternative to conventional optical media in visible light communication (VLC) systems. In a novel approach, the high photoluminescence quantum yield organic crystal 2,2dash-((1E,1Edash)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))diphenol (SAA) is used as an optical waveguide medium for real-time data communication in the visible range, employing a microcontroller unit with on off keying modulation. Leveraging its spectral properties, the SAA crystal demonstrates dual active and passive waveguiding capabilities for signal modulation. Error-free signal detection is achieved thanks to the smooth, defect-free surface morphology of the crystal. The relationship between incident angle and light intensity reveals stable fluorescence under narrow angle excitation, positioning the crystal as an all-angle signal receiver that surpasses conventional optical fibers. A real time data transfer setup is demonstrated, enabling direct transmission from a serial interface and accurate reconstruction of grayscale images. This represents the first implementation of a fully organic crystal-based VLC platform, integrating wavelength conversion, omnidirectional waveguiding, and real time signal processing. The results establish a foundation for compact, efficient, and integrable photonic communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Frustrated $J_1-J_2$ Diamond Lattice Antiferromagnet Co$_2$Ti$_3$O$_8$ with a Vacancy-ordered Spinel Structure Synthesized via a Topochemical Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable Co$_2$Ti$_3$O$_8$ was synthesized through a topochemical reaction using Li$_2$CoTi$_3$O$_8$ as the precursor, resulting in a vacancy-ordered spinel structure. Crystal structure analysis confirmed that Co ions selectively occupy the A-site, giving rise to a frustrated diamond lattice. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements revealed antiferromagnetic order at 4.4 K, which is markedly suppressed compared to the negative Weiss temperature of ${\sim}-27$ K, indicating a high degree of frustration effects. Pulsed high-field magnetization measurements revealed a four-step successive magnetic phase transition, demonstrating that Co$_2$Ti$_3$O$_8$ is a promising candidate for a frustrated $J_1-J_2$ diamond lattice. Additionally, the $J_2/J_1$ ration estimated from the molecular field approximation suggests the possibility of a spiral ordered ground state. These observations highlight the potential of frustrated magnetism in ordered spinel structures to expand the material search space for quantum magnetism, including magnetic skyrmions.</description>

Abstract: Recent works indicate that heterogeneous response and non-Markovianity may yield recognizable hallmarks in the microrheology of semisolid viscoelastic materials. Here we perform numerical simulations using a non-Markovian overdamped Langevin approach to explore how the microrheology experienced by probe particles immersed in an effective semisolid material can be influenced by its micro-heterogeneities. Our results show that, besides affecting the mean squared displacement, the time-dependent diffusion coefficient, and the shear moduli, the micro-heterogeneities lead to displacement distributions that deviate from the usual Gaussian behavior. In addition, our study provides an analytical way to characterize the micro-heterogeneities of semisolid viscoelastic materials through their microrheology.</description>

      <title>Giant piezoelectricity driven by Thouless pump in conjugated polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Piezoelectricity of organic polymers has attracted increasing interest because of several advantages they exhibit over traditional inorganic ceramics. While most organic piezoelectrics rely on the presence of intrinsic local dipoles, a highly nonlocal electronic polarization can be foreseen in conjugated polymers, characterised by delocalized and highly responsive ${\pi}$-electrons. These 1D systems represent a physical realization of a Thouless pump, a mechanism of adiabatic charge transport of topological nature which results, as shown in this work, in anomalously large dynamical effective charges, inversely proportional to the band gap energy. A structural (ferroelectric) phase transition further contributes to an enhancement of the piezoelectric response reminiscent of that observed in piezoelectric perovskites close to morphotropic phase boundaries. First-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations performed in two representative conjugated polymers using hybrid functionals, show that state-of-the-art organic piezoelectric are outperformed by piezoelectric conjugated polymers, mostly thanks to strongly anomalous effective charges of carbon, larger than 5e - ordinary values being of the order of 1e - and reaching the giant value of 30e for band gaps of the order of 1 eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An unexpectedly large transient magnetization induced by circularly polarized ferroelectric phonons was recently observed in a nonmagnetic insulator SrTiO3 [Nature 628, 534 (2024)]. We use a minimal molecular orbital model to demonstrate two electronic contributions to this effect. An atomic orbital contribution arises from the pumping of orbital angular momentum of Ti by chiral motion of coordinating oxygen atoms. An additional inter-atomic contribution is associated with the transient circulating current around the oxygen atoms, resulting in efficient dressing of phonons by electron dynamics. The insights provided by our model may facilitate the development of ultrafast magnetization control and orbitronic sources.</description>

Abstract: The generation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is central to quantum technologies. Color centers in insulators have been extensively studied for single-photon generation, but organic molecules immobilized on substrates have gained attention due to their superior scalability, large oscillator strengths, and tunable emission frequency. Here, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the photoemission from organic molecules adsorbed on 2D materials. Focusing on terrylene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we obtain zero phonon line (ZPL) energies and emission lineshapes in excellent agreement with experiments. Notably, antisite defects in hBN can immobilize the molecule without influencing its key emission features. We further show that the main effect of the 2D substrate is to introduce sharp sidebands near the ZPL as a fingerprint of hindered rotational, translational, or bending modes of the molecule. Our findings provide insight into how substrate interactions shape the optical properties of molecular systems for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Toward machine learning interatomic potentials for modeling uranium mononitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising accident-tolerant fuel because of its high fissile density and high thermal conductivity. In this study, we developed the first machine learning interatomic potentials for reliable atomic-scale modeling of UN at finite temperatures. We constructed a training set using density functional theory (DFT) calculations that was enriched through an active learning procedure, and two neural network potentials were generated. Both potentials successfully reproduce key thermophysical properties of interest, such as temperature-dependent lattice parameter, specific heat capacity, and bulk modulus. We also evaluated the energy of stoichiometric defect reactions and defect migration barriers and found close agreement with DFT predictions, demonstrating that our potentials can be used for modeling defects in UN. Additional tests provide evidence that our potentials are reliable for simulating diffusion, noble gas impurities, and radiation damage.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale structure formation in nickel-aluminum alloys synthesized far from equilibrium</title>

Abstract: The present study reports on the structure formation in thin epitaxial nickel-aluminum films (Ni1-xAlx; Al atomic fraction x up to x=0.24) grown on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. Experimental and computational data demonstrate that for x&lt;0.11, the films exhibit the face-centered cubic random solid-solution Ni1-xAlx structure ({\gamma}). Whereas in the range x=0.11-0.24 the phase coexists with the ordered L12 structure ({\gamma}' phase). The two phases are homogenously intermixed forming a coherent and strained nano-solution, which exhibits a single lattice parameter that expands as the Al content increases. Isothermal annealing of films containing x=0.14 of Al, coupled with structural and nano-mechanical characterization, reveal that the nano-solution retains its overall integrity for temperatures up to 673 K, while the film hardness increases from 5.5 GPa (as deposited films) to 6 GPa. Further increase of the annealing temperature to 873 K and 1073 K causes the nano-solution to dissolve into distinct {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phase domains and the hardness to decrease down to values of 4 GPa. These findings confirm the metastable nature of the as-deposited thin Ni1-xAlx alloy films and underpin the effectiveness of high supersaturation/undercooling for creating non-equilibrium phases and self-organized nanostructures upon synthesis of multicomponent materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic states in condensed matter physics, particularly antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions (Sks) and bimerons (Bms), offer promising prospects for terahertz dynamics and sustained current-induced motion, thanks to their compensating multiple sub-lattice structure. However, nucleating AFM Sks and Bms is challenging due to the lack of net magnetization. Previous attempts to imprint pre-defined Sks and Bms in a ferromagnet (FM) and transfer them to an AFM using interfacial exchange bias in FM/AFM heterostructures have been hindered by complex multilayers with discontinuities, polycrystallinity, or multipartite chiral AFMs. Employing atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate the viability of texture imprinting for nucleating Sks and Bms in AFMs, using a prototypical bipartite AFM layer in a multilayer structure free from discontinuities. Such imprinting is a crucial step towards understanding the static and dynamic properties of natural antiferromagnetic textures and their unique properties.</description>

      <title>Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02407v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays a fundamental role in determining its physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. However, this is often inadequately addressed by existing generative models, making the consistent generation of stable and symmetrically valid crystal structures a significant challenge. We introduce WyFormer, a generative model that directly tackles this by formally conditioning on space group symmetry. It achieves this by using Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer encoder and an absence of positional encoding. Extensive experimentation demonstrates WyFormer's compelling combination of attributes: it achieves best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, incorporates a physics-motivated inductive bias, produces structures with competitive stability, predicts material properties with competitive accuracy even without atomic coordinates, and exhibits unparalleled inference speed.</description>

      <title>A simple method for detection and quantitative estimation of deep levels in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift</title>

Abstract: The characterization of deep levels in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is one of the most important problems in GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) technology. This work reports on a technique for determination of deep level concentration in AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. The proposed method is relatively simple, and it is based on the detection of free holes created by optically induced transitions of electrons from the deep levels to the conduction band. The developed method can detect and provide quantitative estimation of deep level traps in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. Furthermore, it provides a framework for analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift, which includes an important experimental criterion of determination whether the holes are generated or not in the AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by sub-band gap illumination. The method was verified by applications it to a study of the deep levels in GaN HEMTs grown on various substrates, i.e. SiC and GaN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of MoS$_2$ polymorphs, specifically the semiconducting 2H phase and the metallic 1T$^\prime$ phase, as anchoring materials to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li--S) batteries. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$ exhibits stronger Li--S interactions, greater charge transfer, and enhanced catalytic activity compared to its 2H counterpart, effectively suppressing polysulfide dissolution and facilitating redox reactions. The reversible 2H$\leftrightarrow$1T$^\prime$ transition offers a tunable design space for balancing conductivity and structural stability. These findings position hybrid MoS$_2$ architectures as promising platforms for next-generation Li--S batteries with improved energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability.</description>

      <title>Engineering Altermagnetism via Layer Shifts and Spin Order in Bilayer MnPS$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetic materials combine compensated magnetic order with momentum-dependent spin splitting, offering a fundamentally new route for spintronic functionality beyond conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. While most studies have focused on three-dimensional compounds, the emergence of altermagnetism in few-layer two-dimensional materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that bilayer MnPS$_3$, a prototypical 2D van der Waals magnet, can host stacking-induced altermagnetic phases. Using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis, we show that interlayer spin alignment and lateral displacement act as coupled symmetry control parameters that switch the system between Type II (collinear AFM) and Type III (altermagnetic) phases. Our systematic exploration reveals how specific stacking geometries enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. These results establish stacking engineering as a powerful, purely structural route for designing tunable altermagnetic states in 2D magnets, opening pathways toward symmetry-driven spintronic and magnetoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum many-body methods provide a systematic route to computing electronic properties of molecules and materials, but high computational costs restrict their use in large-scale applications. Due to the complexity in many-electron wavefunctions, machine learning models capable of capturing fundamental many-body physics remain limited. Here, we present a deep learning framework targeting the many-body Green's function, which unifies predictions of electronic properties in ground and excited states, while offering physical insights into many-electron correlation effects. By learning the $GW$ or coupled-cluster self-energy from mean-field features, our graph neural network achieves competitive performance in predicting one- and two-particle excitations and quantities derivable from one-particle density matrix. We demonstrate its high data efficiency and good transferability across chemical species, system sizes, molecular conformations, and correlation strengths in bond breaking, through multiple molecular and nanomaterial benchmarks. This work opens up opportunities for utilizing machine learning to solve many-electron problems.</description>

      <title>Structural characterization of the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a noncentrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its noncentrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirm that its structure is noncentrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa, whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between 50 K and 75 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <title>Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra-Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon-Near-Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a platform to achieve ultra-strong coupling (USC) between light and matter using widely available materials. USC is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths exceeding 10% of the ground state energy. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here we leverage dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate USC to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO2 layer. The strong out-of-plane electric fields in our tapered bar structure overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode, resulting in a normalized coupling strength of 0.101 and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the ENZ mode energy; a four- to five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. The strong field confinement of our approach opens new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices, such as tunable frequency converters and low-energy optical modulators.</description>

      <title>Interface-induced collective phase transition in VO2-based bilayers studied by layer-selective spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the origin of collective electronic phase transitions induced at the heterointerface between monoclinic insulating (MI) VO2 and rutile metallic (RM) electron-doped VO2 layers using in situ soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPES) on nanoscale VO2/V0.99W0.01O2 (001)R bilayers. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of SXPES, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The layer-selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the MI-phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the RM phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the RM-phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the MI phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the RM and MI phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the MI to the RM phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers.</description>
