      <title>Categorising current-voltage curves in single-molecule junctions and their comparison to Single-Level Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the mechanically controlled break junctions, with a particular emphasis on elucidating the behaviour of molecular currents at room temperature. The core of this experimental investigation involves a detailed analysis of conductance, examining how it varies over time and with changes in the gap between electrodes. Additionally, this study thoroughly evaluates transmission properties, coupling effects, and current characteristics. A pivotal aspect of the research was the meticulous current measurement, followed by carefully selecting optimal data sets. This process set the stage for an in-depth analysis of resonant tunnelling phenomena observed through a single channel. Notably, these experiments were conducted under open atmospheric conditions at room temperature. A significant finding from this study is the recognition that our current model requires refinement. This adjustment is necessary to encapsulate a broader spectrum of molecular transport mechanisms more accurately. Furthermore, this work significantly advances our comprehension of quantum effects in single-molecule junctions, particularly concerning similar molecules to Corannulene extending to some organometallics. One of the essential disclosures is the identification of deviations in the transport model, primarily attributable to electron-electron interactions. This insight is crucial as it paves the way for developing a more comprehensive and precise model, enhancing our understanding of molecular-scale electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based optimization of spintronic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of physical parameters serves various purposes, such as system identification and efficiency in developing devices. Spin-torque oscillators have been applied to neuromorphic computing experimentally and theoretically, but the optimization of their physical parameters has usually been done by grid search. In this paper, we propose a scheme to optimize the parameters of the dynamics of macrospin-type spin-torque oscillators using the gradient descent method with automatic differentiation. First, we prepared numerically created dynamics as teacher data and successfully tuned the parameters to reproduce the dynamics. This can be applied to obtain the correspondence between the simulation and experiment of the spin-torque oscillators. Next, we successfully solved the image recognition task with high accuracy by connecting the coupled system of spin-torque oscillators to the input and output layers and training all of them through gradient descent. This approach allowed us to estimate how to control the experimental setup and design the physical systems so that the task could be solved with a high accuracy using spin-torque oscillators.</description>

      <title>Berry phase effects on the transverse conductivity of Fermi surfaces and their detection via spin qubit noise magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-static transverse conductivity of clean Fermi liquids at long wavelengths displays a remarkably universal behaviour: it is determined solely by the radius of curvature of the Fermi surface and does not depend on details such as the quasi-particle mass or their interactions. Here we demonstrate that Berry phases do not alter such universality by directly computing the transverse conductivity of two-dimensional electronic systems with Dirac dispersions, such as those appearing in graphene and its chiral multilayer variants. Interestingly, however, such universality ceases to hold at wave-vectors comparable to the Fermi radius, where Dirac fermions display a vividly distict transverse conductivity relative to parabolic Fermions, with a rich wave-vector dependence that includes divergences, oscillations and zeroes. We discuss how this can be probed by measuring the $T_1$ relaxation time of spin qubits, such as NV centers or nuclear spins, placed near such 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Winding Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their ubiquity, systematic characterization of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold exceptional points (EP$n$s), remains a significant unsolved problem. In this article, we characterize Abelian topology of eigenvalues for generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s for arbitrary $n$. The former and the latter emerge in a $(2n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-dimensional parameter space, respectively. By introducing resultant winding numbers, we elucidate that these EP$n$s are stable due to topology of a map from a base space (momentum or parameter space) to a sphere defined by these resultants. Our framework implies fundamental doubling theorems of both generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s in $n$-band models.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonlinear conductivity induced by quantum geometry in altermagnets and measurement of the in-plane N\'{e}el vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $z$-component of the N\'{e}el vector is measurable by the anomalous Hall conductivity in altermagnets because time reversal symmetry is broken. On the other hand, it is a nontrivial problem how to measure the in-plane component of the N\'{e}el vector. We study the second-order nonlinear conductivity of a system made of the $d$-wave altermagnet with the Rashba interaction. It is shown that the quantum-metric induced nonlinear conductivity and the nonlinear Drude conductivity are proportional to the in-plane component of the N\'{e}el vector, and hence, the in-plane component of the N\'{e}el vector is measurable. We obtain analytic formulas of the quantum-metric induced nonlinear conductivity and the nonlinear Drude conductivity both for the longitudinal and transverse conductivities. The quantum-metric induced nonlinear conductivity diverges at the Dirac point, while the nonlinear Drude conductivity is always finite. Hence, the quantum-metric induced nonlinear conductivity is dominant at the Dirac point irrespective of the relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal conductance of a Majorana wire near the topological transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of the nonlocal conductance $G_{RL}(V)$ for a disordered Majorana wire tuned near the topological transition critical point. We show that the differential conductance is an odd function of bias, $G_{RL}(V) = -G_{RL}(-V)$. We factorize the conductance into terms describing the contacts between the wire and the normal leads, and the term describing quasiparticle propagation along the wire. Topological transition affects only the latter term. At the critical point, the quasiparticle localization length has a logarithmic singularity at the Fermi level, $l(E) \propto \ln(1 / E)$. This singularity directly manifests in the conductance magnitude, as $\ln |G_{RL}(V) / G_Q| \sim L / l(eV)$ for the wire of length $L \gg l(eV)$. Tuning the wire away from the immediate vicinity of the critical point changes the monotonicity of $l(E)$. This change in monotonicty allows us to define the width of the critical region around the transition point.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall effect and zero plateau in bulk HgTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect, which exhibits a number of unusual properties, is studied in a gated 1000-nm-thick HgTe film, nominally a three-dimensional system. A weak zero plateau of Hall resistance, accompanied by a relatively small value of Rxx of the order of h/e^2, is found around the point of charge neutrality. It is shown that the zero plateau is formed by the counter-propagating chiral electron-hole edge channels, the scattering between which is suppressed. So, phenomenologically, the quantum spin Hall effect is reproduced, but with preserved ballisticity on macroscopic scales (larger than 1mm). It is shown that the formation of the QHE occurs in a two-dimensional (2D) accumulation layer near the gate, while the bulk carriers play the role of an electron reservoir. Due to the exchange of carriers between the reservoir and the 2D layer, an anomalous scaling of the QHE is observed not with respect to the CNP, but with respect to the first electron plateau.</description>

      <title>Electrical detection in two-terminal perpendicularly magnetized devices via geometric anomalous Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-uniform current distribution arisen from either current crowding effect or hot spot effect provides a method to tailor the interaction between thermal gradient and electron transport in magnetically ordered systems. Here we apply the device structural engineering to realize an in-plane inhomogeneous temperature distribution within the conduction channel, and the resulting geometric anomalous Nernst effect (GANE) gives rise to a non-zero 2nd -harmonic resistance whose polarity corresponds to the out-of-plane magnetization of Co/Pt multi-layer thin film, and its amplitude is linearly proportional to the applied current. By optimizing the aspect ratio of convex-shaped device, the effective temperature gradient can reach up to 0.3 K/$\mu$m along the y-direction, leading to a GANE signal of 28.3 $\mu$V. Moreover, we demonstrate electrical write and read operations in the perpendicularly-magnetized Co/Pt-based spin-orbit torque device with a simple two-terminal structure. Our results unveil a new pathway to utilize thermoelectric effects for constructing high-density magnetic memories</description>

      <title>Polarized Raman Analysis at Low Temperature to Examine Interface Phonons in InAs/GaAs_(1-x)Sb_x Quantum Dot Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental study of optical phonon modes, both normal and interface (IF) phonons, in bilayer strain-coupled InAs/GaAs_(1-x)Sb_x quantum dot heterostructures has been presented by means of low-temperature polarized Raman scattering. The effect of Sb-content on the frequency positions of these phonon modes has been very well correlated with the simulated strain. The Raman peaks show different frequency shifts in the heterostructure with varying Sb-content in the capping layer. This shift is attributed to the strain relaxation, bigger size of quantum dots and type-II band alignment.</description>

      <title>Absence of heat flow in {\nu} = 0 quantum Hall ferromagnet in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge neutrality point of bilayer graphene, denoted as {\nu} = 0 state, manifests competing phases marked by spontaneously broken isospin (spin/valley/layer) symmetries under external magnetic and electric fields. However, due to their electrically insulating nature, identifying these phases through electrical conductance measurements remains challenging. A recent theoretical proposal introduces a novel approach, employing thermal transport measurements to detect these competing phases. Here, we experimentally explore the bulk thermal transport of the {\nu} = 0 state in bilayer graphene to investigate its ground states and collective excitations associated with isospin. While the theory anticipates a finite thermal conductance in the {\nu} = 0 state, our findings unveil an absence of detectable thermal conductance. Through variations in the external electric field and temperature-dependent measurements, our results suggest towards gapped collective excitations at {\nu} = 0 state. Our findings underscore the necessity for further investigations into the nature of {\nu} = 0.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dynamic Generation of Spin Polarization by Time-Varying Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric control of spin in insulators is desired for low-consumption and ultrafast spintronics, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose an intrinsic effect of dynamic spin generation driven by time-varying electric field. In the intraband response regime, it can be nicely formulated as a Berry curvature effect and leads to two phenomena that are forbidden in the $dc$ limit: linear spin generation in nonmagnetic insulators and intrinsic N{\'e}el spin-orbit torque in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic insulators. These phenomena are driven by the time derivative of field rather than the field itself, and have a quantum origin in the first-order dynamic anomalous spin polarizability. Combined with first-principles calculations, we predict sizable effects driven by terahertz field in nonmagnetic monolayer Bi and in antiferromagnetic even-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, which can be detected in experiment.</description>

      <title>Robust Coulomb Gap and Varied-temperature Study of Epitaxial 1T'-WSe$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with a 1T' structural phase are predicted to be two-dimensional topological insulators at zero temperature. Although the quantized edge conductance of 1T'-WTe$_2$ has been confirmed to survive up to 100 K, this temperature is still relatively low for industrial applications. Addressing the limited studies on temperature effects in 1T'-TMDCs, our research focuses on the electronic and crystal properties of the epitaxial 1T'-WSe$_2$ monolayers grown on bilayer graphene (BLG) and SrTiO$_3$(100) substrates at various temperatures. For the 1T'-WSe$_2$ grown on BLG, we observed a significant thermal expansion effect on its band structures with a thermal expansion coefficient of $\sim$60$\times$10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$. In contrast, the 1T'-WSe$_2$ grown on SrTiO$_3$(100) exhibits minimal changes with varied temperatures due to the enhanced strain exerted by the substrate. Besides, A significant Coulomb gap (CG) was observed pinned at the Fermi level in the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). The CG was founded to decrease with increasing temperatures, and can persist up to 200 K for 1T'-WSe$_2$/BLG, consistent with our Monte Carlo simulations. The robustness of the CG and the positive fundamental gap endow the epitaxial 1T'-WSe$_2$ monolayers with huge potential for realizing the quantum spin Hall devices.</description>

      <title>Scaling the topological transport based on an effective Weyl model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological semimetals are increasingly fueling interests in exotic electronic-thermal physics including thermoelectrics and spintronics. To control the transports of topological carriers in such materials becomes a central issue. However, the topological bands in real materials are normally intricate, leaving obstacles to understand the transports in a physically clear way. Parallel to the renowned effective two-band model in magnetic field scale for semiconductors, here, an effective Weyl-band model in temperature scale was developed with pure Weyl state and a few meaningful parameters for topological semimetals. Based on the model, a universal scaling was established and subsequently verified by reported experimental transports. The essential sign regularity of anomalous Hall and Nernst transports was revealed with connection to chiralities of Weyl nodes and carrier types. Upon a double-Weyl model, a concept of Berry-curvature ferrimagnetic structure, as an analogy to the real-space magnetic structure, was further proposed and well described the emerging sign reversal of Nernst thermoelectric transports in temperature scale. Our study offers a convenient tool for scaling the Weyl-fermion-related transport physics, and promotes the modulations and applications of magnetic topological materials in future topological quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Strong and tunable coupling between antiferromagnetic magnons and surface plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface plasmons are the collective electron excitations in metallic systems and the associated electromagnetic wave usually has the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. On the other hand, spin waves are the spin excitations perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetization and are usually circularly polarized in a ferromagnet. The direct coupling of these two modes is difficult due to the difficulty of matching electromagnetic boundary conditions at the interface of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. Here, we overcome this challenge by utilizing the linearly polarized spin waves in antiferromagnets (AFM) and show that a strong coupling between AFM magnons and surface plasmons can be realized in a hybrid 2D material/AFM structure, featuring a clear anticrossing spectrum at resonance. The coupling strength, characterized by the gap of anticrossing at resonance, can be tuned by electric gating on 2D materials and be probed by measuring the two reflection minima in the reflection spectrum. Further, as a potential application, we show that plasmonic modes can assist the coupling of two well-separated AFMs over several micrometers, featuring symmetric and antisymmetric hybrid modes. Our results may open a new platform to study antiferromagnetic spintronics and its interplay with plasmonic photonics.</description>

Abstract: Electron spin qubits in silicon are a promising platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Low-frequency noise, including nuclear spin fluctuations and charge noise, is a primary factor limiting gate fidelities. Suppressing this noise is crucial for high-fidelity qubit operations. Here, we report on a two-qubit quantum device in natural silicon with universal qubit control, designed to investigate the upper limits of gate fidelities in a non-purified Si/SiGe quantum dot device. By employing advanced device structures, qubit manipulation techniques, and optimization methods, we have achieved single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99% and a two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate fidelity of 91%. Decoupled CZ gates are used to prepare Bell states with a fidelity of 91%, typically exceeding previously reported values in natural silicon devices. These results underscore that even natural silicon has the potential to achieve high-fidelity gate operations, particularly with further optimization methods to suppress low-frequency noise.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable 2D silicon quantum dot array with coupling beyond nearest neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up quantum dots to two-dimensional (2D) arrays is a crucial step for advancing semiconductor quantum computation. However, maintaining excellent tunability of quantum dot parameters, including both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, during 2D scaling is challenging, particularly for silicon quantum dots due to their relatively small size. Here, we present a highly controllable and interconnected 2D quantum dot array in planar silicon, demonstrating independent control over electron fillings and the tunnel couplings of nearest-neighbor dots. More importantly, we also demonstrate the wide tuning of tunnel couplings between next-nearest-neighbor dots,which plays a crucial role in 2D quantum dot arrays. This excellent tunability enables us to alter the coupling configuration of the array as needed. These results open up the possibility of utilizing silicon quantum dot arrays as versatile platforms for quantum computing and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Microwave radiation at criticality in a hybrid Josephson array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous metallic behavior is ubiquitously observed near superconductor-insulator quantum critical points and, if persistent to zero temperature, poses a challenge to current theories of metals. One explanation for this behavior could be incomplete thermal equilibrium between the sample and the cryostat. However, despite decades of study, the actual temperature of an anomalous metallic sample has not been measured. We therefore introduce a new experimental probe by measuring microwave radiation emitted from the anomalous metal, using a two-dimensional array of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junctions as a model system. The total emitted radiation exceeds the limits of thermodynamic equilibrium, but is well described by an elevated sample temperature. This extracted sample temperature matches the onset of anomalous metallic behavior. Additionally, we discover scaling behavior of radiative noise in the presence of an applied bias. Elements of our noise-scaling observations were predicted based on nonlinear critical field theories and gauge-gravity duality. This work shows that, in a prominent model system, anomalous metallic behavior is a non-equilibrium effect, and opens a new frontier in the study of universal, non-equilibrium phenomena near quantum criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the correspondence between circuit Laplacian and Schrodinger equation, recent investigations have shown that classical electric circuits can be used to simulate various topological physics and the Schrodinger's equation. Furthermore, a series of quantum-inspired information processing have been implemented by using classical electric circuit networks. In this review, we begin by analyzing the similarity between circuit Laplacian and lattice Hamiltonian, introducing topological physics based on classical circuits. Subsequently, we provide reviews of the research progress in quantum-inspired information processing based on the electric circuit, including discussions of topological quantum computing with classical circuits, quantum walk based on classical circuits, quantum combinational logics based on classical circuits, electric-circuit realization of fast quantum search, implementing unitary transforms and so on.</description>

      <title>Bloch oscillations of Fibonacci anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons, which correspond to collective excitations possessing multiple fusion channels and noncommuting braiding statistics, serve as the fundamental constituents for topological quantum computation. Here, we reveal the exotic Bloch oscillations (BOs) induced by non-Abelian fusion of Fibonacci anyons. It is shown that the interplay between fusion-dependent internal energy levels and external forces can induce BOs and Bloch-Zener oscillations (BZOs) of coupled fusion degrees with varying periods. In this case, the golden ratio of the fusion matrix can be determined by the period of BOs or BZOs in conjunction with external forces, giving rise to an effective way to unravel non-Abelian fusion. Furthermore, we experimentally simulate nonAbelian fusion BOs by mapping Schrodinger equation of two Fibonacci anyons onto dynamical equation of electric circuits. Through the measurement of impedance spectra and voltage evolution, both fusion-dependent BZOs and BOs are simulated. Our findings establish a connection between BOs and non-Abelian fusion, providing a versatile platform for simulating numerous intriguing phenomena associated with non-Abelian physics.</description>

      <title>Boundary-localized many-body bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs), referring to spatially localized bound states with energies falling within the range of extended modes, have been extensively investigated in single-particle systems, leading to diverse applications in photonics, acoustics, and other classical-wave systems. Recently, there has been theoretical interest in exploring many-body BICs in interacting quantum systems, which necessitate the careful design of impurity potentials or spatial profiles of interaction. Here, we propose a type of many-body BICs localized at boundaries, which can be purely induced by the uniform onsite interaction without requiring any specific design of impurity potential or nonlocal interaction. We numerically show that three or more interacting bosons can concentrate on the boundary of a homogeneous one-dimensional lattice, which is absent at single- and twoparticle counterparts. Moreover, the eigenenergy of multi-boson bound states can embed within the continuous energy spectra of extended scattering states, thereby giving rise to interactioninduced boundary many-body BICs. Furthermore, by mapping Fock states of three and four bosons to nonlinear circuit networks, we experimentally simulate boundary many-body BICs. Our findings enrich the comprehension of correlated BICs beyond the single-particle level, and have the potential to inspire future investigations on exploring many-body BICs.</description>

      <title>The tuning of para- and diamagnetic cavity photon excitations in a square array of quantum dots in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a ``real-time'' excitation scheme to calculate the excitation spectra of a two-dimensional electron system in a square array of quantum dots placed in a circular cylindrical far-infrared photon cavity subjected to a perpendicular homogeneous external magnetic field. The Coulomb interaction of the electrons is handled via spin density functional theory and the para- and the diamagnetic parts of the electron-photon coupling are updated according to a configuration interaction method in each iteration of the density functional calculation. The results show that an excitation scheme built on using the symmetry of the lateral square superlattice of the dots and the cylindrical cavity produces both para- and diamagnetic resonance peaks with oscillator strengths that can be steered by the excitation pulse parameters. The excitation method breaks the conditions for the generalized Kohn theorem and allows for insight into the subband structure of the electron system and can be used both in and outside the linear response regime.</description>

      <title>Characterizing generalized Floquet topological states in hybrid space-time dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spatiotemporally modulated systems, topological states exist not only in energy gaps but also in momentum gaps. Such unconventional topological states impose challenges on topological physics. The underlying models also make the conventional Hamiltonian descriptions complicated. Here, we propose to describe such systems with space- and time-direction transfer matrices which substantially simplify the underlying theory and give direct information on the topological properties of the quasienergy and quasimomentum gaps. In particular, we find that the space- and time-direction reflection phases can serve as signatures for distinguishing various topological phases of the quasienergy and quasimomentum gaps. This approach directly reveals the topological properties of the band gap, avoiding the complexity in calculating bulk band topology in hybrid energy-moment space. By investigating two concrete models, we show that the method works well for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we uncover an unconventional topological state, called the anomalous Floquet quasimomentum gap, whose topological properties are invariant for different choices of the unit-cell center. This work advances the study of topological phenomena in hybrid space-time (energy-momentum) dimension that are attracting much interest due to the development of spatiotemporally modulated materials.</description>

      <title>Electric readout of the N\'eel vector in an altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics, the significant change in electrical resistance with the switching of the N\'eel vector of an antiferromagnet plays a crucial role in electrically-readable antiferromagnetic memory with opposite N\'eel vectors as binary "0" and "1". Here, we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory to explore the diverse magnetoresistance effects in an altermagnet. The theory demonstrates an eye-catching antiferromagnetic anisotropic magnetoresistance, i.e., the change in magnetoresistance with the orientation of the N\'eel vector rather than net magnetization, which is bound to become one of the most significant phenomena in spintronics. Furthermore, the interplay between the spin Hall effect and anisotropic spin splitting effect leads to a substantial electrical resistance linear to the magnetic field-controllable N\'eel vector of the altermagnet akin to the giant magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic materials and therefore is crucial for an electrically readable antiferromagnetic memory. Our microscopic theory contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental physics underlying antiferromagnetic spintronics and provides valuable insights for designing novel electronic devices involving altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Correlations of the Current Density in Many-Body Landau Level States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in quantum gas microscopy, we investigate correlation functions of the current density in many-body Landau Level states, such as the Laughlin state of the fractional quantum Hall effect. For states fully in the lowest Landau level, we present an exact relationship which shows that all correlation functions involving the current density are directly related to correlation functions of the number density. We calculate perturbative corrections to this relationship arising from inter-particle interactions, and show that this provides a method by which to extract the system's interaction energy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our results also to lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Bound states and scattering of magnons on a superconducting vortex in ferromagnet-superconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the magnon spectrum in a thin ferromagnetic-superconductor heterostructure in the presence of a single superconducting vortex. We employ the Bogolubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian which describes the magnons in the presence of the stray magnetic field and the non-uniform magnetic texture induced by the vortex. We find that the vortex localizes magnon states approximately in the same way as a charge center produces electron bound states due to screened Coulomb interaction in the two-dimensional electron gas. The number of these localized states is substantially determined by the material parameters of the ferromagnetic film only. We solve the scattering problem for an incident plane spin wave and compute the total and transport cross sections. We demonstrate that the vortex-induced non-uniform magnetic texture in chiral ferromagnetic film produces a skew scattering of magnons. We explore the peculiarities of the quantum scattering problem that correspond to orbiting in the classical limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photon emitters (SPEs) are building blocks of quantum technologies. Defect engineering of 2D materials is ideal to fabricate SPEs, wherein spatially deterministic and quality-preserving fabrication methods are critical for integration into quantum devices and cavities. Existing methods use combination of strain and electron irradiation, or ion irradiation, which make fabrication complex, and limited by surrounding lattice damage. Here, we utilise only ultra-low energy electron beam irradiation (5 keV) to create dilute defect density in hBN-encapsulated monolayer MoS2, with ultra-high spatial resolution (&lt; 50 nm, extendable to 10 nm). Cryogenic photoluminescence spectra exhibit sharp defect peaks, following power-law for finite density of single defects, and characteristic Zeeman splitting for MoS2 defect complexes. The sharp peaks have low spectral jitter (&lt; 200 {\mu}eV), and are tuneable with gate-voltage and electron beam energy. Use of low-momentum electron irradiation, ease of processing, and high spatial resolution, will disrupt deterministic creation of high-quality SPEs.</description>

      <title>Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE) performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily polarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag edges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function, which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the overall {\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT calculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal conductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the irradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing BLG for advanced TE applications through light-induced modifications.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic damping induces the temporal and spatial decay of spin waves, characterized by the damping factor and attenuating length, both of which can be measured to determine various magnetic and spin-transport parameters. By investigating the dispersion and dissipation of inertial spin waves driven by spin-transfer torques, we find that magnetic inertia modifies the dependence of the damping factor and attenuating length on the electric current and spin wave frequency. This provides a valuable method for probing the inertial relaxation time.</description>

Abstract: We study a generalised version of Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The model is inspired from graphene which shows a linear dispersion relation near the Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the mean field approximation have been studied before. Here we go beyond the mean field level by deriving a Beth-Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations, solutions of which we explore numerically, for the first time including their momentum dependence. We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure and phase shifts. We also perform a comparison with the NJL model in 3+1 dimension and discuss its implication for graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions are non-analyticities in a dynamical free energy (or return rate) which occur at critical times. Although extensively studied in one dimension, the exact nature of the non-analyticity in two and three dimensions has not yet been fully investigated. In two dimensions, results so far are known only for relatively simple two-band models. Here we study the general two- and three-dimensional cases. We establish the relation between the non-analyticities in different dimensions, and the functional form of the densities of Fisher zeroes. We show, in particular, that entering a critical region where the density of Fisher zeroes is non-zero at the boundary always leads to a cusp in the derivative of the return rate while the return rate itself is smooth. We illustrate our results by obtaining analytical results for exemplary two- and three-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Two-Fold Anisotropic Superconductivity in Bilayer T$_d$-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric 2D superconductors with large spin-orbit coupling offer an opportunity to explore superconducting behaviors far beyond the Pauli limit. One such superconductor, few-layer T$_d$-MoTe$_2$, has large upper critical fields that can exceed the Pauli limit by up to 600%. However, the mechanisms governing this enhancement are still under debate, with theory pointing towards either spin-orbit parity coupling or tilted Ising spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, ferroelectricity concomitant with superconductivity has been recently observed in the bilayer, where strong changes to superconductivity can be observed throughout the ferroelectric transition pathway. Here, we report the superconducting behavior of bilayer T$_d$-MoTe$ _2$ under an in-plane magnetic field, while systematically varying magnetic field angle and out-of-plane electric field strength. We find that superconductivity in bilayer MoTe$_2$ exhibits a two-fold symmetry with an upper critical field maxima occurring along the b-axis and minima along the a-axis. The two-fold rotational symmetry remains robust throughout the entire superconducting region and ferroelectric hysteresis loop. Our experimental observations of the spin-orbit coupling strength (up to 16.4 meV) agree with the spin texture and spin splitting from first-principles calculations, indicating that tilted Ising spin-orbit coupling is the dominant underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Scalable Reshaping of Diamond Particles via Programmable Nanosculpting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond particles have many interesting properties and possible applications. However, producing diamond particles with well-defined shapes at scale is challenging because diamonds are chemically inert and extremely hard. Here, we show air oxidation, a routine method for purifying diamonds, can be used to precisely shape diamond particles at scale. By exploiting the distinct reactivities of different crystal facets and defects inside the diamond, layer-by-layer outward-to-inward and inward-to-outward oxidation produced diverse diamond shapes including sphere, twisted surface, pyramidal islands, inverted pyramids, nano-flowers, and hollow polygons. The nanosculpted diamonds had more and finer features that enabled them to outperform the original raw diamonds in various applications. Using experimental observations and Monte Carlo simulations, we built a shape library that guides the design and fabrication of diamond particles with well-defined shapes and functional value. Our study presents a simple, economical and scalable way to produce shape-customized diamonds for various photonics, catalysis, quantum and information technology applications.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in Semidilute Polyelectrolyte Solutions and Complex Coacervates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that hydrodynamics in dense polyelectrolyte (PE) solutions, such as semidilute PE solutions and PE complex coacervates, is heavily screened and inconsequential. Here, using mesoscale molecular dynamics that explicitly accounts for hydrodynamics, we show that segmental dynamics in the subdiffusive regime show strong signatures of hydrodynamic interactions that persist well beyond the correlation length of semidilute PE solutions with moderately short chains. The strong hydrodynamic effects are also observed in coacervate systems containing moderately short chains, even with PE concentration as high as $30\%$. Our work fills a gap in the existing simulation literature on dense PE solutions and hints at the importance of hydrodynamics in the transport and rheological properties in broader polymer/polyelectrolyte solution systems.</description>

      <title>Heat current and fluctuations between a dissipative qubit and a monitor under continuous measurement and feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous quantum measurement and feedback induce heat exchange between a dissipative qubit and a monitor even in the steady state, as a measurement backaction. Using the Lindblad equation, we identified the maximum and minimum values of the steady-state heat current as the measurement and feedback states vary, and we demonstrate the qubit cooling induced by these processes. Turning our attention to quantum trajectories under continuous measurement and feedback, we observe that the heat current fluctuates around the steady-state values. We reveal that the fluctuations are strongly influenced by the measurement backaction, distinguishing them from the standard Poisson noise typically observed in electric circuits. Our results offer potential application in the development of quantum refrigerators controlled by continuous measurement and feedback, and provide deep insight into quantum thermodynamics from the perspective of fluctuation.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of structural, electronic and optical properties of non-toxic RbBaX$_3$ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) perovskites under hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the structural, mechanical, electronic and optical properties of Rb-based cubic perovskite RbBaX$_3$ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) under hydrostatic pressure, using first-principle density functional theory (DFT). All RbBaX$_3$ perovskites exhibit thermodynamic and mechanical stability at ambient pressure. RbBaF$_3$ remains structurally stable across all examined pressures, while RbBaCl$_3$, RbBaBr$_3$, and RbBaI$_3$ maintain mechanical stability up to 60, 60, and 40 GPa, respectively. These materials are ductile even at elevated pressure. RbBaF$_3$ has a direct bandgap of 4.80 eV while other compositions exhibit indirect band gaps of 4.37, 3.73, and 3.24 eV with halide atoms of Cl, Br, and I, respectively. Under elevated hydrostatic pressure, only RbBaCl$_3$ and RbBaI$_3$ exhibit an indirect-to direct band transition while others preserve their nature of band gap. Our results show that spin-orbit coupling significantly affects only the valance bands of larger-sized halides (Cl, Br, I). With hybrid functional (HSE) correction, the band gaps of these four materials increase to 6.7, 5.6, 4.8 and 4.4 eV, respectively, but the nature of direct/indirect band transition remains unchanged. Orbital-decomposed partial density of states calculation reveals that the halogen p-orbitals dominate the valence band near the Fermi level, while Rb 5s-orbital affects the conduction band minima the most. Investigation of the optical properties reveals wide-band absorption, low electron loss, moderate reflectivity and lower refractive index in the UV to deep-UV range. The strength and range of absorption increases significantly with hydrostatic pressure, suggesting that RbBaX$_3$ perovskites are promising candidates for tunable UV-absorbing optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Increased Brightness and Reduced Efficiency Droop in Perovskite Quantum Dot Light-Emitting Diodes using Carbazole-Based Phosphonic Acid Interface Modifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of [2-($\textit{9H}$-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz) and [2-(3,6-di-$\textit{tert}$-butyl-$\textit{9H}$-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (t-Bu-2PACz) as anode modification layers in metal-halide perovskite quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). Compared to conventional QLED structures with PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate)/PVK (poly(9-vinylcarbazole)) hole-transport layers, QLEDs made with phosphonic acid (PA)-modified indium tin oxide (ITO) anodes show an over 7-fold increase in brightness, achieving a brightness of 373,000 cd m$^{-2}$, one of the highest brightnesses reported to date for colloidal perovskite QLEDs. Importantly, the onset of efficiency roll-off, or efficiency droop, occurs at ~1000-fold higher current density for QLEDs made with PA-modified anodes compared to control QLEDs made with conventional PEDOT:PSS/PVK hole transport layers, allowing the devices to sustain significantly higher levels of external quantum efficiency at a brightness of &gt;10$^{5}$ cd m$^{-2}$. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements indicate these improvements are due to a combination of multiple factors, including reducing quenching of photoluminescence at the PEDOT:PSS interface and reducing photoluminescence efficiency loss at high levels of current density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of topological pairing orders characterized by a half-integer pair monopole charge, leading to Berry phase enforced half-integer partial wave symmetry. This exotic spinor order emerges from pairing between Fermi surfaces with Chern numbers differing by an odd integer. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate spinor superconducting orders with monopole charges $\pm 1/2$, featuring a single gap node and nontrivial surface states. Additionally, the superfluid velocity follows a fractionalized Mermin-Ho relation in spatially inhomogeneous pairing orders. The concept extends to spinor density waves and excitons.</description>

      <title>Selective Switching Between Two Band-Edge Alignments in Ternary Pentagonal CdSeTe Monolayer: Atom-Valley Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of photocatalytic water splitting, no current studies have explicitly investigated the coexistence of multiple band-edge alignments in two-dimensional (2D) materials with intrinsic electric fields. In this Letter, we designed the ternary pentagonal CdSeTe monolayer, and proposed a novel concept called atom-valley locking, which could provide multiple band-edge positions. In the CdSeTe monolayer, two distinct valleys emerge in the electronic structure, one contributed by Se atoms and the other by Te atoms, with a spontaneous polarization of 187 meV between them. This phenomenon can be attributed to the localization of valley electrons and the breaking of four-fold rotational reflection symmetry, yet it does not rely on the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Due to the atom-dependent valley distribution, two types of band-edge alignments can be identified. Moreover, selective switching between them can be achieved by strain engineering, thereby enabling precise control over the site of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Our findings open up new opportunities for exploring valley polarization and provide unique insights into the photocatalytic applications of 2D materials with intrinsic electric fields.</description>

      <title>Topological Nodal Chains and Transverse Transports in Ferromagnetic Centrosymmetric Semimetal FeIn2S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nodal chain semimetals protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries are distinct from Dirac and Weyl semimetals, featuring unconventional topological surface states and resulting in anomalous magnetotransport properties. Here, we reveal that the ferromagnetic FeIn2S4 is a suitable nodal chain candidate in theory. Centrosymmetric FeIn2S4 with nonsymmorphic symmetries shows half-metallicity and clean band-crossings with hourglass-type dispersion tracing out nodal lines. Owing to glide mirror symmetries, the nontrivial nodal loops form nodal chain, which is associated with the perpendicular glide mirror planes. These nodal chains are robust against spin-orbital interaction, giving rise to the coexistence of drumhead-type surface states and closed surface Fermi arcs. Moreover, the nodal loops protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry contribute to large anomalous Hall conductivity and the anomalous Nernst conductivity. Our results provide a platform to explore the intriguing topological state and transverse transport properties in magnetic system.</description>

      <title>Selective Excitation of Bloch Modes in Canalized Polaritonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polaritonic crystals (PoCs) have experienced significant advancements through involving hyperbolic polaritons in anisotropic materials such as $\alpha$-MoO$_{\rm 3}$, offering a promising approach for nanoscale light control and improved light-matter interactions. Notably, twisted bilayer $\alpha$-MoO$_{\rm 3}$ enables tunable iso-frequency contours (IFCs), especially generating flat IFCs at certain twist angles, which could enhance mode selectivity in their PoCs through the highly collimated and canalized polaritons. This study unveils the selective excitation of Bloch modes in PoCs with square-lattice structures on twisted bilayer $\alpha$-MoO$_{\rm 3}$ with canalized phonon polaritons. Through the optimization of the square lattice design, there is an effective redistribution of canalized polaritons into the reciprocal lattices of PoCs. Fine-tuning the periodicity and orientation of the hole lattice enables momentum matching between flat IFCs and co-linear reciprocal points, allowing precise and directional control over desired Bragg resonances and Bloch modes. This research establishes a versatile platform for tunable polaritonic devices and paves the way for advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Giant light emission enhancement in strain-engineered InSe/MS$_2$ (M=Mo,W) van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional crystals stack together through weak van der Waals (vdW) forces, offering unlimited possibilities to play with layer number, order and twist angle in vdW heterostructures (HSs). The realisation of high-performance optoelectronic devices, however, requires the achievement of specific band alignments, $k$-space matching between conduction band minima and valence band maxima, as well as efficient charge transfer between the constituent layers. Fine tuning mechanisms to design ideal HSs are lacking. Here, we show that layer-selective strain engineering can be exploited as an extra degree of freedom in vdW HSs to tailor their band alignment and optical properties. To that end, strain is selectively applied to MS$_2$ (M=Mo,W) monolayers in InSe/MS$_2$ HSs. This triggers a giant PL enhancement of the highly tuneable but weakly emitting InSe by one to three orders of magnitude. Resonant PL excitation measurements, supported by first-principle calculations, provide evidence of a strain-activated direct charge transfer from the MS$_2$ MLs toward InSe. This significant emission enhancement achieved for InSe widens its range of applications for optoelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the diode effect of the supercurrent in the Josephson junctions with the loop current states as the tunneling barrier. The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Geometric Control of Active Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter represents a class of non-equilibrium systems that constantly dissipate energy to produce directed motion. The thermodynamic control of active matter holds great potential for advancements in synthetic molecular motors, targeted drug delivery, and adaptive smart materials. However, the inherently non-equilibrium nature of active matter poses a significant challenge in achieving optimal control with minimal energy cost. In this work, we extend the concept of thermodynamic geometry, traditionally applied to passive systems, to active matter, proposing a systematic geometric framework for minimizing energy cost in non-equilibrium driving processes. We derive a cost metric that defines a Riemannian manifold for control parameters, enabling the use of powerful geometric tools to determine optimal control protocols. The geometric perspective reveals that, unlike in passive systems, minimizing energy cost in active systems involves a trade-off between intrinsic and external dissipation, leading to an optimal transportation speed that coincides with the self-propulsion speed of active matter. This insight enriches the broader concept of thermodynamic geometry. We demonstrate the application of this approach by optimizing the performance of an active monothermal engine within this geometric framework.</description>

Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic metamaterials by ion-implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for the additive fabrication of planar magnetic nanoarrays with minimal surface roughness. Synthesis is accomplished by combining electron-beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions, we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of nanometers. Our results demonstrate the successful application of this technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit well-defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned magnetic elements.</description>

      <title>A Zero-Threshold PT-Symmetric Polariton-Raman Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17475v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity-time (PT) symmetry in a non-Hermitian framework can be harnessed for numerous applications in optics such as laser mode selection, non-reciprocal light propagation, polaritonic optical switches, and enhanced sensing. Here we show a zero-threshold Raman laser can be achieved in an anisotropic optical microcavity in the PT-symmetry broken phase via polarization selective optical pumping. A loss-gain mechanism between two polarized Stokes modes arises naturally via polarization dependent stimulated scattering and anisotropic Raman gain of the active layered material inside the microcavity. A microscopic theory of stimulated Raman process in anisotropic microcavity successfully explains our results at various temperatures and enabled us to predict the parameters of a proposed quantum PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. Our realization of the zero-threshold Raman laser and the proposed theory of stimulated Raman scattering in anisotropic microcavity can lead to future development of novel technologies such as efficient quantum frequency converters for applications in quantum photonics and information.</description>

      <title>Observation of the scaling dimension of fractional quantum Hall anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional quasiparticles emerging in the fractional quantum Hall regime present the challenge of observing their exotic properties unambiguously. Although the fractional charge of quasiparticles has been demonstrated since nearly three decades, the first convincing evidence of their anyonic quantum statistics has only recently been obtained and, so far, the so-called scaling dimension that determines the quasiparticles propagation dynamics remains elusive. In particular, while the non-linearity of the tunneling quasiparticle current should reveal their scaling dimension, the measurements fail to match theory, arguably because this observable is not robust to non-universal complications. Here we expose the scaling dimension from the thermal noise to shot noise crossover, and observe an agreement with expectations. Measurements are fitted to the predicted finite temperature expression involving both the quasiparticles scaling dimension and their charge, in contrast to previous charge investigations focusing on the high bias shot noise regime. A systematic analysis, repeated on multiple constrictions and experimental conditions, consistently matches the theoretical scaling dimensions for the fractional quasiparticles emerging at filling factors 1/3, 2/5 and 2/3. This establishes a central property of fractional quantum Hall anyons, and demonstrates a powerful and complementary window into exotic quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermi sea in a metal can host exotic quantum topology, which determines its conductance quantization and is characterized by Euler characteristic $\chi_F$. Unlike gapped band topology described by the global feature of wave function, this topology of gapless system is associated with the geometry of Fermi sea, and thus probing and identifying $\chi_F$ are inherently difficult in high-dimensional systems. Here, we propose a dimensional reduction theory for $d$-dimensional Fermi sea topology, showing that $\chi_F$ can be determined by the feature of so-called reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces, with theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness. By performing the gapization for the metallic systems, we also reveal that $\chi_F$ can be reflected in the gapped band topology, which further provides an indirect way to measure $\chi_F$ through the (pseudo)spin structures of the superconducting system. Our work opens an avenue to characterize and detect the Fermi sea topology using low-dimensional momentum information.</description>

      <title>Topological electronic crystals in twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a dilute two-dimensional electron gas, Coulomb interactions can stabilize the formation of a Wigner crystal. Although Wigner crystals are topologically trivial, it has been predicted that electrons in a partially-filled band can break continuous translational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry spontaneously to form a form of topological electron crystal known as an anomalous Hall crystal. Here, we report the observation of a generalized version of the anomalous Hall crystal in twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene, whose formation is driven by the moire potential. The crystal forms at a band filling factor of one electron per four moir\'e unit cells ($\nu=1/4$) and quadruples the unit-cell area, coinciding with an integer quantum anomalous Hall effect. The Chern number of the state is exceptionally tunable, and can be switched reversibly between $+1$ and $-1$ by electric and magnetic fields. Several other topological electronic crystals arise in a modest magnetic field, originating from $\nu=1/3$, $1/2$, $2/3$, and $3/2$. The quantum geometry of the folded bands is likely very different from that of the original parent band, enabling possible future discoveries of correlation-driven topological phenomena</description>

      <title>Exceptional topology in Non-Hermitian Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene has extraordinary electronic properties at the magic angle along with an isolated flat band at magic angle. However, the non-Hermitian phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene remain unexplored. In this work, we study a non-Hermitian TBG formed by one-layer graphene twisted relative to another layer with gain and loss. Using a non-Hermitian generalization of Bistritzer-MacDonald model, we find Dirac cones centered at only $K_M$ ($K'_M$) corner of the moir\'e Brillouin zone at $K'$ ($K$) valley deformed in the presence of non-Hermiticity. This is different from single layer graphene with gain and loss, where rings of exceptional points appear in both $K$ and $K'$ corners of the Brillouin zone.The coincident of exceptional rings at $\Gamma_M$ point characterizes an ``exceptional magic angle", at which the system hosts flat bands with zero energy and finite lifetime. More interestingly, we find that the topological charge in the moir\'e Brillouin zone is conserved during the expansion and fusion of the exceptional ring, which is absent in two-dimensional systems constraining by Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem.These findings can be demonstrated in realistic cold atom and metamaterial systems and will stimulate further study on non-Hermitian phenomena in twistronic.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field assisted exciton diffusion in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study exciton energy spectrum and their propagation in moir\'e superlattices formed in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. In such structures, as a result of weak interlayer interaction, an effective, moir\'e, potential acting on excitons arises. Usually, excitons are considered to be localized in such potential. Here we demonstrate that the coupling of optically active excitons with induced electromagnetic field produces linear in the wavevector energy dispersion even if the quantum mechanical tunneling between the localization sites is suppressed. The effect can be described as a result of the processes of virtual generation-recombination of excitons at the localization sites that results in the $ r^{-3}$ dependence of the transfer matrix element on the intersite distance $r$. Based on the calculated energy spectrum we study exciton propagation in moir\'e superlattices with allowance for the light-exciton interaction. We consider semiclassical diffusion of excitons and take into account exciton-phonon and exciton-static defect scattering. For these mechanisms the diffusion coefficient decreases with increase of the temperature. We also analyze the hopping propagation regime and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient is described by the power-law rather than by an exponential function of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter Butterflies in Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this chapter, we investigate the energy spectra as well as the bulk and surface states in a two-dimensional system composed of a coupled stack of one-dimensional dimerized chains in the presence of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we analyze the Hofstadter butterfly patterns that emerge in a 2D stack of coupled 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains subject to an external transverse magnetic field. Depending on the parameter regime, we find that the energy spectra of this hybrid topological system can exhibit topologically non-trivial bulk bands separated by energy gaps. Upon introducing boundaries into the system, we observe topologically protected in-gap surface states, which are protected either by a non-trivial Chern number or by inversion symmetry. We examine the resilience of these surface states against perturbations, confirming their expected stability against local symmetry-preserving perturbations.</description>

      <title>Theory of quantum anomalous Hall phases in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene moir\'e structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remarkable recent experiments on the moir\'e structure formed by pentalayer rhombohedral graphene aligned with a hexagonal Boron-Nitride substrate report the discovery of a zero field fractional quantum hall effect. These "(Fractional) Quantum Anomalous Hall" ((F)QAH) phases occur for one sign of a perpendicular displacement field, and correspond, experimentally, to full or partial filling of a valley polarized Chern-$1$ band. Such a band is absent in the non-interacting band structure. Here we show that electron-electron interactions play a crucial role, and present microscopic theoretical calculations demonstrating the emergence of a nearly flat, isolated, Chern-$1$ band and FQAH phases in this system. We also study the four and six-layer analogs and identify parameters where a nearly flat isolated Chern-$1$ band emerges which may be suitable to host FQAH physics.</description>

      <title>Toolbox for nonreciprocal dispersive models in circuit QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic method for constructing effective dispersive Lindblad master equations to describe weakly-anharmonic superconducting circuits coupled by a generic dissipationless nonreciprocal linear system, with effective coupling parameters and decay rates written in terms of the immittance parameters characterizing the coupler. This article extends the foundational work of Solgun et al. (2019) for linear reciprocal couplers described by an impedance response. Here, we expand the existing toolbox to incorporate nonreciprocal elements, account for direct stray coupling between immittance ports, circumvent potential singularities, and include dissipative interactions arising from interaction with a common bath. We illustrate the use of our results with a circuit of weakly-anharmonic Josephson junctions coupled to a multiport nonreciprocal environment and a dissipative port. The results obtained here can be used for the design of complex superconducting quantum processors with non-trivial routing of quantum information, as well as analog quantum simulators of condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>A mesoscopic device for a realization of the Topological Kondo effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for anyons is a field of immense interest owing to its potential application in the field of quantum information. Quantum critical Kondo impurities constitute one possible platform for their realization and Topological Kondo effect (TKE) by virtue of remaining critical in the presence of perturbations, seems to be especially promising in this regard. In this paper we discuss practical steps for a realization of TKE with a relatively high Kondo temperature $T_K$. Its central feature is the so-called Majorana-Cooper box (MCB) and we argue that a particular type of iron-based topological superconductor is especially suitable for realization of TKE. Once MCB is available one needs to connect it to external metallic leads to produce TKE. A relatively high value of the Kondo temperature $T_K$ is then aided by a large superconducting gap of the iron-based superconductor. We give estimates for $T_K$, for the cases of both isotropic and anisotropic exchange couplings of MCB with the leads.</description>

      <title>Stability of slow Hamiltonian dynamics from Lieb-Robinson bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>Controllable Weyl Nodes and Fermi Arcs from Floquet Engineering Triple Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering with periodic driving as a powerful tool for designing desirable topological states has been the subject of intense recent studies. Here, we present the application of Floquet engineering to investigate evolution of topological triple fermions under irradiation of circularly polarized light (CPL), a phenomenon that currently remains a mystery. By using first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we demonstrate that WC-type TiO and its analogues are promising candidates for Floquet engineering of triple fermions. The symmetry analysis reveals that the electric field of CPL can break the specific symmetries, such as the time-reversal symmetry and its combination of spatial symmetries, inducing a transition to a flexibly controllable Weyl semimetallic phase. The survived spatial symmetry, controlled by light, guarantees that the Weyl nodes are located along the high-symmetry line or in high-symmetry planes in momentum space. Our findings focusing on Floquet engineering in realistic materials featured by triple fermions would facilitate both theoretical and experimental interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of individual nuclear spins in a crystal coupled to a neighbouring paramagnetic center, detected using microwave fluorescence at millikelvin temperatures. We observe real-time quantum jumps of the nuclear spin state, a proof of their individual nature. By driving the forbidden transitions of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system, we also achieve single-spin solid-effect dynamical nuclear polarization. Relying exclusively on microwave driving and microwave photon counting, the methods reported here are in principle applicable to a large number of electron-nuclear spin systems, in a wide variety of samples.</description>

Abstract: The use of structurally complex lattice defects, such as functional groups, embedded nanoparticles, and nanopillars, to generate phonon scattering is a popular approach in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications. However, the theoretical treatment of this scattering phenomenon remains a formidable challenge, especially with regard to the determination of the scattering cross sections and rates associated with such lattice defects. Using the extended atomistic Green's function (AGF) method, we describe how the numerically exact mode-resolved scattering cross section $\sigma $ can be computed for a phonon scattered by a single lattice defect. We illustrate the generality and utility of the AGF-based treatment with two examples. In the first example, we treat the isotopic scattering of phonons in a harmonic chain of atoms . In the second example, we treat the more complex problem of phonon scattering in a carbon nanotube (CNT) containing an encapsulated C60 molecule which acts as a scatterer of the CNT phonons. The application of this method can enable a more precise characterization of lattice-defect scattering and result in a more controlled use of nanostructuring and lattice defects in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>General Stacking Theory for Altermagnetism in Bilayer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06964</link>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetism was recently proposed to be attainable in twisted antiferromagnetic bilayers providing an experimentally feasible approach to realize it in 2D materials. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism governing the appearance of altermagnetism in bilayer systems is still absent. In present letter, we address this gap by introducing a general stacking theory (GST) as a key condition for the emergence of altermagnetism in bilayer systems. The GST provides straightforward criteria to predict whether a bilayer demonstrates altermagnetic spin splitting, solely based on the layer groups of the composing monolayers. According to the GST, only seven point groups of bilayers facilitate the emergence of altermagnetism. It is revealed that, beyond the previously proposed antiferromagnetic twisted vdW stacking, altermagnetism can even emerge in bilayers formed through the symmetrically restricted direct stacking of two monolayers. By combining the GST and first-principles calculations, we present illustrative examples of bilayers demonstrating altermagnetism. Our work establishes a robust framework for designing diverse bilayer systems with altermagnetism, thereby opening up new avenues for both fundamental research and practical applications in this field.</description>
