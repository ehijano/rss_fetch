      <title>Analysis of Atomic Charge State and Atomic Number for VAMOS++ Magnetic Spectrometer using Deep Neural Networks and Fractionally Labelled Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer is a multi-parametric system that integrates ion optical magnetic elements with a multi-detector stack. The magnetic elements, along with the tracking and timing detectors and the trajectory reconstruction method, provide the analysis of the magnetic rigidity, the trajectory length between the beam interaction point and the focal plane of the spectrometer, and the related velocity and mass-over-charge ratio. The segmented ionization chamber provides the energy measurements necessary to analyze the atomic charge state and atomic number. However, this analysis critically suffers from inherent limitations due to the variable thickness and non-uniformity of the entrance window of the ionization chamber and other detector imperfections. Conventionally, this meticulous, detailed analysis is exceptionally tedious, often requiring several months to complete. We present a novel method utilizing deep neural networks, trained on an experimental dataset with only a small fraction of precisely labeled events for the lowest and best-resolved atomic charge states or numbers. This innovative approach enables the networks to autonomously and accurately classify the remaining events. This method drastically accelerates the acquisition of high-resolution atomic charge state and atomic number spectra, reducing analysis time from months to mere hours. Crucially, by discarding human bias, this approach ensures standardized, optimal, and reproducible results with unprecedented efficiency.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Walk in Fast Timing: The Role of Dual Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In preparation for HL-LHC operation, a number of new detector systems are being constructed with timing precision on physics objects of $\leq50$ picoseconds. These time stamps will reduce the level of pileup induced backgrounds as the number of interactions per crossing will reach of order 100-200.
  In this report we note that this high pileup level will necessitate a new approach to calibration of these large timing arrays (typically with several $\times10^5$ channels) since a single t$_{0}$ reference is hard to come by in regular data taking.
  We demonstrate that enhancing the usual pair of timing ASIC data (ie threshold time and amplitude or time-over-threshold) with a 2nd threshold time greatly simplifies the analysis of amplitude walk. Since slope at threshold is directly relevant for amplitude walk, day-1 walk calibration can often have an analytical solution.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy of $DN$ and $\bar{D}N$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of the ALICE@LHC and STAR@RHIC experiments to reconstruct $D$ mesons has enabled femtoscopic correlation measurements of open-charm mesons in both small and large systems. In this work, we present a theoretical calculation of the correlation functions of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons with nucleons, based on the Koonin-Pratt formalism applied to the systems produced in these high-energy collisions. We use an effective Lagrangian that models the interaction between charmed mesons and baryons. From the unitarized on-shell amplitudes, we extract the low-energy scattering parameters and compute the correlation functions using the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation. Additionally, we apply the TROY formalism to obtain the off-shell $T$-matrix in coupled channels and reconstruct the full wave function, which we incorporate into the Koonin-Pratt formula. We compare these two approaches and provide predictions for different correlated pairs, including the effects of the Coulomb interaction and thermal weights for the coupled channels. These results can be tested against current and future experimental data from ALICE and STAR collaborations in both proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>UrQMD Simulations of Higher-order Cumulants in Au+Au Collisions at High Baryon Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High moments of conserved quantities such as net-baryon, net-electric charge, and net-strangeness in heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to fluctuations caused by the QCD critical point (CP). The event-by-event analysis of high moments of the conserved charges has been widely used in experiments to search for the CP, especially in the RHIC-STAR experiment.
  In order to establish a {\it dynamical non-critical base line}, especially at the high baryon density region, we have performed a systematic analysis of the proton multiplicity distributions from Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq$ $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $\leq$ 9.2 GeV collisions. The results on beam energy, centrality and rapidity width dependence of proton (factorial) cumulants, up to the $4^{th}$ order, are extracted from the calculations of the hadronic transport model UrQMD. In addition, the effects of initial volume fluctuation is also discussed. These results will be important when we do physics analysis the RHIC beam energy scan (BES) data, especially for the fixed-target data and experimental data from future CBM experiment at FAIR.</description>

      <title>Multiple rescattering effects in the hard knockout reaction $\mathbf{^2\mbox{H}(p,2p)n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a proton with a deuteron is the simplest nuclear reaction. However, it allows the study of precursors of nuclear medium effects such as initial-state/final-state interactions (ISI/FSI). In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron.</description>

      <title>Global $\Lambda$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the model of three-fluid dynamics (3FD), the global $\Lambda$ polarization ($P_\Lambda$) is calculated in Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq\sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq$ 9 GeV, in which high baryon density is achieved. Various contributions to $P_\Lambda$ are considered: those from the thermal vorticity, meson field, thermal shear and spin-Hall effect. Feed-down from higher-lying resonances is also taken into account. The results are compared with available data. Special attention is payed to the collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV, for which a thorough scan of the energy, rapidity, and centrality dependence of $P_\Lambda$ is performed. The results for 3 GeV reasonably well reproduce the corresponding STAR data. While the results at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV can be considered as predictions for results of measurements within the STAR fixed-target (STAR-FXT) programthat are expected in the nearest future. It is predicted that a broad maximum of $P_\Lambda$ is reached at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\approx$ 3--3.9 GeV, exact position of which depends on the centrality and width of the midrapidity range of observation. Impact of the meson-field, thermal-shear and spin-Hall-effect contributions to $P_\Lambda$ is also studied.</description>

      <title>Design of a Storage Ring based on a Fixed Field Alternating Gradient Configuration with an Internal Target for Heavy-Ion Beams with Stochastic Charge State Conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the general use of a heavy-ion accelerator, an accelerated beam impinged on a target is spoiled into a beam dump. To make more efficient use of the beam, recycling of the beam passed through the target is proposed in the framework of the so-called energy recovery internal target (ERIT). In the ERIT system, the target is irradiated inside the circulating beam by recovering the energy lost in the target using rf cavities. So far, such a system has been realized only for proton beams. Here, the ERIT system for heavy-ion beam is demonstrated for the first time. A challenging issue is the circulation of all ions with different atomic charge. An ion has a probability of equilibrated charge state distribution after passing through the target, independent of the initial charge state. This phenomenon of stochastic charge state conversion (SCSC) causes rapid beam-emittance growth. To solve this problem, we developed a method to match the closed orbits and betatron functions of the beams in different charge states at the target location in a ring based on a scaling fixed field alternating gradient (FFA) lattice structure. We present the design of such an FFA ring and show, through full 6D beam tracking simulations, that transverse emittance growth can be effectively suppressed even in the presence of SCSC.</description>
