      <title>Influence of the radial number of Laguerre-Gaussian vortex beams on their propagation in a turbulent medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the propagation of Laguerre-Gaussian beams in a turbulent gas medium. As demonstrated by numerical modelling and the decomposition of Laguerre-Gaussian modes according to the basis of orthogonal Zernike polynomials, disparities in the stability of Laguerre-Gaussian modes with differing radial and azimuthal numbers are evident. The demonstration is made of the minimization of the distortion of the transverse beam profile with an increase in the radial number.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Interconnects via Phase-Coherent Four-Wave Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum transduction, which enables the coherent conversion of quantum information between disparate physical platforms, is a cornerstone for realizing scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (&gt;99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-optimal nonlinear microscopy with classical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical processes are used in biological microscopy to surpass the diffraction limit on resolution, image deeper into brain tissues, and identify biomolecules without exogenous labels. These techniques typically require high optical intensities to increase the strength of the nonlinear interactions, which can perturb native biochemistry and damage or kill living samples. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy visualizes the spatial distribution of molecules using a nonlinear interaction between light and chemically specific molecular vibrations. However, the detection of biomolecules at low concentrations is limited by the total photon dose that can be applied before photodamage alters the sample, and photon shot noise sets the minimum achievable noise floor for most microscopes. Here we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced SRS microscope that is more sensitive than an equivalent conventional SRS microscope by up to 8.3(7) dB in spectroscopy and 8.6(1) dB in cell imaging. These results approach quantum limits on sensitivity and demonstrate that quantum states of light are sufficient but not necessary to enhance the sensitivity of microscopy techniques that are limited by photodamage.</description>

      <title>Detection and imaging of chemicals and hidden explosives using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting concealed chemicals and explosives remains a critical challenge in global security. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers a promising non-invasive and stand-off detection technique owing to its ability to penetrate optically opaque materials without causing ionization damage. While many chemicals exhibit distinct spectral features in the terahertz range, conventional terahertz-based detection methods often struggle in real-world environments, where variations in sample geometry, thickness, and packaging can lead to inconsistent spectral responses. In this study, we present a chemical imaging system that integrates THz-TDS with deep learning to enable accurate pixel-level identification and classification of different explosives. Operating in reflection mode and enhanced with plasmonic nanoantenna arrays, our THz-TDS system achieves a peak dynamic range of 96 dB and a detection bandwidth of 4.5 THz, supporting practical, stand-off operation. By analyzing individual time-domain pulses with deep neural networks, the system exhibits strong resilience to environmental variations and sample inconsistencies. Blind testing across eight chemicals, including pharmaceutical excipients and explosive compounds, resulted in an average classification accuracy of 99.42% at the pixel level. Notably, the system maintained an average accuracy of 88.83% when detecting explosives concealed under opaque paper coverings, demonstrating its robust generalization capability. These results highlight the potential of combining advanced terahertz spectroscopy with neural networks for highly sensitive and specific chemical and explosive detection in diverse and operationally relevant scenarios.</description>

      <title>Long-wave mid-infrared cavity-enhanced frequency comb spectroscopy of cold, complex molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of a new instrument for cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy of the fundamental rovibrational transitions of molecules in the long-wave mid-infrared (LWIR) region from 6500 to 10000 nm. Our setup combines a LWIR frequency comb, a high-finesse optical enhancement cavity, a cryogenic buffer gas cooling cell, and a Fourier transform interferometer to obtain broadband, high-resolution, and high-sensitivity molecular absorption spectra. Here, we showcase the capabilities of this setup by presenting the gas-phase LWIR spectra of the $\nu_6$ band of ethane and the $\nu_{10}$ band of ethanol near 7200 nm under both room temperature and cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <title>Relative Wavefront Error Correction Over a 2.4 km Free-Space Optical Link via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In coherent optical communication across turbulent atmospheric channels, reference beacons can be multiplexed with information-encoded signals during transmission. In this case, it is commonly assumed that the wavefront distortion of the two is equivalent. In contrast to this assumption, we present experimental evidence of relative wavefront errors (WFEs) between polarization-multiplexed reference beacons and signals, after passing through a 2.4 km atmospheric link. We develop machine learning-based wavefront correction algorithms to compensate for observed WFEs, via phase retrieval, resulting in up to a 2/3 reduction in the relative phase error variance. Further, we analyze the excess noise contributions from relative WFEs in the context of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), where our findings suggest that if future CV-QKD implementations employ wavefront correction algorithms similar to those reported here, an order of magnitude increase in secure key rates may be forthcoming.</description>

      <title>Sub-cycle pulse control of holographic and non-holographic electron interferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of sub-cycle laser pulses on holographic and non-holographic intracycle interferences by analyzing the photoelectron momentum distributions of helium using TDSE simulations supported by classical trajectory calculations. The results show that the forward-scattering holographic (FSH), backward-scattering holographic (BSH), and time double-slit (TDS) structures are found to be highly sensitive to the pulse duration, carrier-envelope phase (CEP), and temporal envelope in the sub-cycle regime. Sub-cycle pulses with CEP values of $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ selectively enhance or suppress distinct features, isolating holographic patterns and enhancing BSH fringes. Classical analysis reveals that the intrinsic chirp inherent to sub-cycle fields shortens the recollision time for scattering trajectories, thereby increasing the fringe spacing in FSH and BSH patterns, while simultaneously enlarging the ATI peak spacing associated with TDS interference. Pulse envelope variations, even at fixed FWHM duration, further reshape the fringe spacings by modifying the instantaneous frequency and vector potential slope near ionization times. These results demonstrate that sub-cycle pulses enable precise temporal control of holographic interference, offering new opportunities for probing and manipulating attosecond electron dynamics.</description>

      <title>An all-optical convolutional neural network for image identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern artificial intelligence, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a cornerstone for visual and perceptual tasks. However, their implementation on conventional electronic hardware faces fundamental bottlenecks in speed and energy efficiency due to resistive and capacitive losses. Photonic alternatives offer a promising route, yet the difficulty of realizing optical nonlinearities has prevented the realization of all-optical CNNs capable of end-to-end image classification. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical CNN that bypasses the need for explicit optical nonlinear activations. Our architecture comprises a single spatial-differentiation convolutional stage--using 24 directional kernels spanning 360{\deg}, along with a mean-filtering kernel--followed by a diffractive fully-connected layer. The directional convolution enhances feature selectivity, suppresses noise and crosstalk, and simplifies the classification task, allowing the weak nonlinearity inherent in optical diffraction to achieve high accuracy. We report experimentally classification accuracies of 86.8% on handwritten digits (MNIST) and 94.8% on a ten-class gesture dataset. The system delivers a computational throughput of 1.13X10^5 tera-operations per second (TOPS) and an energy efficiency of 1.51X10^3 TOPS/W--the highest reported among CNN hardware--with the potential to improve by a further 5-6 orders of magnitude using nanosecond-scale detectors. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward ultralow-latency, ultralow-energy vision processing for real-time intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally high Verdet constant in gold nanodisc arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optical effects in non-magnetic noble metals can be greatly enhanced by leveraging the in-plane Lorentz force at engineered plasmonic resonances. We demonstrate a 2D array of gold nanodiscs designed to host a hybrid resonance of localized plasmon and surface lattice modes. The structure exhibits a Verdet constant of 1.98e6 deg/T.m, corresponding to a Faraday rotation of -0.15 deg at a 1 T magnetic field. This Verdet constant represents a 15-fold enhancement over unpatterned gold and is highly competitive with many plasmon-enhanced diamagnetic nanostructures. These findings offer new opportunities for harnessing strong magneto-plasmonic effects in optoelectronic devices by patterning common non-magnetic metals.</description>

      <title>Demultiplexing through a multimode fiber using chip-scale diffractive neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's information age, advanced fiber optic transmission technology is of paramount importance. Multimode fibers (MMFs) using space-division multiplexing (SDM) are promising for improved transmission capacity, connection flexibility, and security of data. However, the complex transmission characteristics of MMFs significantly hinder precise mode demultiplexing. Conventional approaches, including holographic measurements, phase retrieval algorithms, photonic lanterns, and multiplane light conversion, are limited by system complexity, size, and flexibility. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a purely optical, chip-scale AI solution for high-mode isolation, speed-of-light demultiplexing of MMF modes using a three-dimensional diffractive neural network (DNN). The DNN is trained with synthetic modal data and fabricated using two-photon nanolithography. It features a compact size of $120{\mu}m \times 120{\mu}m \times 80{\mu}m$ and a diffractive structure size of $1{\mu}m^{2}$ for the neurons at the hidden layers of the network. Experimentally, the DNN demultiplexer achieves a relative demultiplexing accuracy of over 80%. The AI approach of DNN allows for flexible design and overcomes the size and performance limitations of digital-optical demultiplexers. This work paves the way for compact, low-latency optical processors for high-performance demultiplexers and enables scalable, chip-integrated solutions for next-generation fiber optic networks.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Fourier Ptychographic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging in the terahertz (THz) spectral range remains fundamentally constrained by the limited numerical apertures of currently existing state-of-the-art imagers, which restricts its applicability across many fields, such as imaging in complex media or nondestructive testing. To address this challenge, we introduce a proof-of-concept implementation of THz Fourier Ptychographic imaging to enhance spatial resolution without requiring extensive hardware modifications. Our method employs a motorized kinematic mirror to generate a sequence of controlled, multi-angle plane-wave illuminations, with each resulting oblique-illumination intensity image encoding a limited portion of the spatial-frequency content of the target imaging sample. These measurements are combined in the Fourier domain using an aberration-corrected iterative phase-retrieval algorithm integrated with an efficient illumination calibration scheme, which enables the reconstruction of resolution-enhanced amplitude and phase images through the synthetic expansion of the effective numerical aperture. Our work establishes a robust framework for high-resolution THz imaging and paves the way for a wide array of applications in materials characterization, spectroscopy, and non-destructive evaluation.</description>

      <title>Statistical Insight into the Correlation of Geometry and Spectral Emission in Network Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active networks show feature-rich emission that depends on the fine details of their geometry, and find diverse applications in random lasers, sensing devices and photonics processors. In these and other systems, a thorough and predictive characterization of how the network geometry correlates with the resulting emission spectrum would be highly important, however such outright description is still lacking. In this work, we take a step toward filling this gap, by using the well-known Steady-State ab Initio Laser Theory (SALT) equations [L. Ge et al., Phys. Rev. A 82, 063824 (2010)] to carry out an extensive set of statistical analyses and establish connections between the random network geometry and their ultimate emission spectrum. Our results show that edge crowding is key to tune the uniformity of the modal intensity distribution of the emission spectrum. A statistical framework for the comprehensive understanding of the network statistical properties is highly significant to establish precise design rules for network-based photonic devices and intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Near-Zero Crosstalk and Ultra-Low Loss Waveguide Crossings Enabled by three-dimensional Ta2O5-on-LNOI Integrated Photonic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide crossings represent one of the most critical components in very-large-scale photonic integration (VLSPI). Three-dimensional waveguide crossings, which distribute optical pathways across multiple planes, can achieve near-zero crosstalk and extremely low crossing-induced loss. However, they face an intrinsic trade-off between interlayer crossing performance and coupling efficiency. To address this challenge, we developed a low-cost fabrication method for 3D waveguide crossings by exploiting the edge rounding effect inherent to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Using this method, we demonstrate waveguide crossings with average loss below 0.002 dB and crosstalk below -62 dB on Ta2O5-on-LNOI integrated photonic platform. Our method maintains full compatibility with conventional semiconductor manufacturing technology and paves the way for realizing VLSPI on the thin-film lithium niobate platform.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Optics-Enhanced Michelson Interferometer for Spectroscopy of Narrow-Band Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive optics enables the deployment of interferometer-based spectroscopy without the need for moving parts necessary for scanning the interferometer arms. Here, we employ a Michelson Interferometer in conjunction with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for determining the spectral profile of a narrow-band light source. Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast. Our findings establish that the Michelson Interferometer can be used to perform spectroscopy of any source within a certain spectral range from simple images of the fringe pattern, so as to facilitate exciting applications towards hyperspectral imaging.</description>

      <title>Frequency and intensity noise of a grating-tuned external-cavity quantum cascade laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are semiconductor-heterostructure devices known for their emission in the mid-infrared and THz spectral regions. Due to their operating regime, their intrinsic linewidth is significantly narrower compared to bipolar semiconductor lasers. Here, we demonstrate that by implementing an external-cavity (EC) configuration based on a commercial diffraction grating, we have successfully induced a Fabry-Perot QCL to emit on a single mode with a broadly-tunable wavelength in the range 4.29-4.44 {\mu}m. This very simple setup enhances the laser's performance in terms of threshold current and emitted power. We further prove that the EC configuration positively impacts the laser's noise properties. In particular, the intrinsic linewidth is substantially reduced, the full linewidth is also decreased (depending on the integration timescale), and the relative intensity noise is slightly reduced. These characteristics, which hold within the whole tuning range, make the EC-QCL a good candidate for spectroscopy applications where broad tunability and narrow linewidth are highly demanded.</description>

      <title>Millimetre-Wave Comb Generated by an Optical Microcomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metrological-grade millimetre wave baseband comb sources covering the subterahertz window are a key building block for next-generation wireless communications, precision sensing, and positioning systems. While optical microcombs have set new benchmarks in ultra-low phase noise single-frequency microwave generation, to date, no microcomb source has directly produced a millimetre-wave baseband comb. Here, we present a 50 GHz repetition rate carrier-envelope offset estabilised millimetre-wave baseband comb source covering the sub-terahertz region, generated from an optical microcomb source. Our microresonator-filtered microcomb enables direct, coherent downconversion via photoconductive antennas, even without external amplification. The metrological-grade optical soliton source produces single-cycle, naturally zero carrier-envelope offset millimetrewave baseband combs. It supports time-domain spectroscopy without any need to temporally align the source and detection pulses, as the ultra-high phase coherence allows significant differences between the optical paths of the source and detection pulses, which we tested over 8m, finding no degradation even in freerunning operation. Finally, the multisoliton operation regime provides a simple way of spectrally tailoring the microwave output by selecting different optical soliton states.</description>

      <title>Structured Light at the Extreme: Harnessing Spatiotemporal Control for High-Field Laser-Matter Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review charts the emerging paradigm of intelligent structured light for high-field laser-matter interactions, where the precise spatiotemporal and vectorial control of light is a critical degree of freedom. We outline a transformative framework built upon three synergistic pillars. First, we survey the advanced electromagnetic toolkit, moving beyond conventional spatial light modulators to include robust static optics and the promising frontier of plasma light modulators. Second, we detail the optimization engine for this high-dimensional design space, focusing on physics-informed digital twins and AI-driven inverse design to automate the discovery of optimal light structures. Finally, we explore the groundbreaking applications enabled by this integrated approach, including programmable electron beams, orbital-angular-momentum-carrying {\gamma}-rays, compact THz accelerators, and robust communications. The path forward necessitates overcoming grand challenges in material science, real-time adaptive control at MHz rates, and the extension of these principles to the quantum realm. This review serves as a call to action for a coordinated, interdisciplinary effort to command, rather than merely observe, light-matter interactions at the extreme.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Response in Metamaterials with Elliptically Perforated Plates: Applications to Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials with tunable optical properties provide a versatile platform for controlling electromagnetic interactions at the nanoscale. This study explores the anisotropic thermal behavior of metamaterials composed of planar plates perforated with periodic arrays of cylinders possessing elliptical cross sections. In contrast to conventional circular perforations, elliptical geometries inherently break rotational symmetry, introducing anisotropy in the effective electromagnetic and thermal response of the structure. Using a fluctuation electrodynamics framework combined with full-wave numerical simulations, we quantify the near-field radiative heat transfer between such elliptically perforated plates as a function of ellipse orientation, aspect ratio, and separation distance. The results reveal that elliptical perforations enable enhanced spectral and directional control of evanescent mode coupling and surface polariton excitation, leading to significant modulation of the near-field heat flux. These findings highlight the potential of geometrically engineered anisotropy for advanced thermal management and energy conversion applications, and offer new design strategies for the development of thermally functional metamaterials operating in the near-field regime.</description>

      <title>Breaking the bandwidth-efficiency trade-off in soliton microcombs via mode coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators have emerged as a powerful tool for compact and coherent frequency comb generation. Advances in nanofabrication have allowed precise dispersion engineering, unlocking octave-spanning soliton combs that are essential for applications such as optical atomic clocks, frequency synthesis, precision spectroscopy, and astronomical spectrometer calibration. However, a key challenge hindering their practical deployment is the intrinsic bandwidth-efficiency trade-off: achieving broadband soliton generation requires large pump detuning, which suppresses power coupling and limits pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies to only a few percent. Recent efforts using pulsed pumping or coupled-resonator architectures have improved efficiency to several tens of percent, yet their bandwidths remain below one-tenth of an octave, inadequate for applications demanding wide spectral coverage. Here, we overcome this limitation by harnessing mode interactions between spatial modes within a single microresonator. The mode hybridization creates an additional power-transfer channel that supports large pump detuning while maintaining strong pump-to-resonator coupling, enabling broadband soliton formation at substantially reduced pump power. Using this approach, we demonstrate an octave-spanning soliton microcomb with a record pump-to-comb conversion efficiency exceeding 50%. These results resolve the fundamental bandwidth-efficiency dilemma in soliton microcombs and paves the way toward fully-integrated, high-efficiency, ultrabroad comb sources for next-generation photonic systems.</description>

      <title>2bNIRS: a portable, multi-distance, broadband oximeter and cytochrome-c-oxidase monitoring system for in vivo applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) instruments typically employ 2-3 wavelengths for monitoring tissue haemodynamics. However, the use of broadband illumination (hundreds of wavelengths) unlocks also the targeting of tissue metabolism by exploiting the wide differential-redox peak of absorption of cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO). For this purpose, we present here a novel, broadband (780-900nm), multi-distance NIRS system, called 2bNIRS. Compact and portable (20 x 30 x 40 cm3), 2bNIRS was validated using a dynamic, optical phantom con-taining blood and yeast, and benchmarked against a multi-wavelength time-domain NIRS (TD-NIRS) system. Validation confirmed its accuracy in tracking haemody-namic and metabolic changes, with superior oximetry performance achieved via our BRUNO algorithm, which integrates broadband spectral fitting with spatially-re-solved analysis. Preliminary in vivo, human applications demonstrated 2bNIRS ap-plicability to monitoring both muscle tissue, during arm cuff occlusions, and the brain, during frontal cortex activation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise, yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks, enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise, representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in photon-limited applications.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-precision tracking of adipocyte dynamics via single lipid droplet whispering-gallery optical resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biophotonics - and more recently, biointegrated photonics - offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators - optical microcavities formed in spherical structures - have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dial for High-Harmonic Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly nonlinear optical process that typically requires an intense laser to trigger emissions at integer multiples of the driving field frequency. However, the strong fields required for conventional HHG inevitably perturb the system, limiting its use as a nondestructive spectroscopic probe. Recent advances in bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) sources have created opportunities to drive HHG with quantum fields alone. In this work, we demonstrate a regime in which the light-matter interactions can be controlled and tuned using a weak classical field, whose pulse energy is two orders of magnitude lower than that in standard HHG-perturbed by an even weaker quantum field such as BSV. This approach opens new avenues for nonlinear spectroscopy of materials while substantially suppressing strong laser-induced damage, distortions, and heating. We show that a BSV pulse containing less than 5% of the classical driving energy can act as an 'optical dial', allowing tuning of the nonlinear emission spectrum, emission angular dependence, and ionization.</description>

      <title>Depth-enhanced molecular imaging with two-photon oblique plane microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-numerical-aperture (NA) oblique plane microscopy enables noninvasive fluorescence imaging of subcellular dynamics without requiring radical sample modification. However, performance degrades at depth in multicellular specimens as scattering and refractive-index heterogeneity raise out-of-focus background. We report a two-photon oblique plane microscope that improves resolution at depth by combining high-NA single-objective detection with multiphoton plane illumination. The microscope achieves $\sim\!300$ nm lateral and $\sim\!650$ nm axial resolution, with single-molecule sensitivity in vivo. Compared with two-photon point scanning, the lower illumination NA delivers an order of magnitude lower peak intensity, enabling $&gt;\!5\times$ faster volumetric acquisition (up to $3.25 \times 10^6$ voxels s$^{-1}$) with reduced photodamage. In multicellular contexts, near-infrared nonlinear excitation enhances contrast throughout the illumination depth by $\sim\!2\times$ and restores volumetric resolving power by $&gt;\!2\times$ relative to linear excitation. We demonstrate these capabilities through molecular imaging of epithelial tissue, stem-cell-derived gastruloids, and living fruit fly embryos, including multicolor transcription-factor dynamics, optogenetic subcellular control, and single-mRNA tracking, all using standard glass-based mounting.</description>

      <title>MCP-Enabled LLM for Meta-optics Inverse Design: Leveraging Differentiable Solver without LLM Expertise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) enables powerful metasurface inverse design but requires extensive theoretical and programming expertise. We present a Model Context Protocol (MCP) assisted framework that allows researchers to conduct inverse design with differentiable solvers through large language models (LLMs). Since LLMs inherently lack knowledge of specialized solvers, our proposed solution provides dynamic access to verified code templates and comprehensive documentation through dedicated servers. The LLM autonomously accesses these resources to generate complete inverse design codes without prescribed coordination rules. Evaluation on the Huygens meta-atom design task with the differentiable TorchRDIT solver shows that while both natural language and structured prompting strategies achieve high success rates, structured prompting significantly outperforms in design quality, workflow efficiency, computational cost, and error reduction. The minimalist server design, using only 5 APIs, demonstrates how MCP makes sophisticated computational tools accessible to researchers without programming expertise, offering a generalizable integration solution for other scientific tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

Abstract: Cold-atom systems have emerged as a highly promising avenue for quantum-enhanced position, navigation, and timing applications. However, their wider adoption is currently hampered in part by the large footprint of the systems. In leveraging the miniaturisation possible through photonic integrated circuits, cold-atom sensors would be able to reach much wider commercial adoption. In this paper, we introduce a platform for evanescently trapping 87Rb using strip silicon nitride waveguides buried in silica using red- and blue-detuned fundamental and higher-order modes, providing a three-dimensional adjustable trap for BEC-based, chip-scale work in quantum science and technologies.</description>
