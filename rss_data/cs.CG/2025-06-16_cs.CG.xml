      <title>Tight Routing and Spanning Ratios of Arbitrary Triangle Delaunay Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Delaunay graph built on a planar point set has an edge between two vertices when there exists a disk with the two vertices on its boundary and no vertices in its interior. When the disk is replaced with an equilateral triangle, the resulting graph is known as a Triangle-Distance Delaunay Graph or TD-Delaunay for short. A generalized $\text{TD}_{\theta_1,\theta_2}$-Delaunay graph is a TD-Delaunay graph whose empty region is a scaled translate of a triangle with angles of $\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3:=\pi-\theta_1-\theta_2$ with $\theta_1\leq\theta_2\leq\theta_3$. We prove that $\frac{1}{\sin(\theta_1/2)}$ is a lower bound on the spanning ratio of these graphs which matches the best known upper bound (Lubiw &amp; Mondal, J. Graph Algorithms Appl., 23(2):345-369). Then we provide an online local routing algorithm for $\text{TD}_{\theta_1,\theta_2}$-Delaunay graphs with a routing ratio that is optimal in the worst case. When $\theta_1=\theta_2=\frac{\pi}{3}$, our expressions for the spanning ratio and routing ratio evaluate to $2$ and $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$, matching the known tight bounds for TD-Delaunay graphs.</description>

      <title>FPT Constant Approximation Algorithms for Colorful Sum of Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the colorful sum of radii problem, where the input is a point set $P$ partitioned into classes $P_1, P_2, \dots, P_\omega$, along with per-class outlier bounds $m_1, m_2, \dots, m_\omega$, summing to $m$. The goal is to select a subset $\mathcal{C} \subseteq P$ of $k$ centers and assign points to centers in $\mathcal{C}$, allowing up to $m_i$ unassigned points (outliers) from each class $P_i$, while minimizing the sum of cluster radii. The radius of a cluster is defined as the maximum distance from any point in the cluster to its center. The classical (non-colorful) version of the sum of radii problem is known to be NP-hard, even on weighted planar graphs. The colorful sum of radii is introduced by Chekuri et al. (2022), who provide an $O(\log \omega)$-approximation algorithm. In this paper, we present the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for the colorful sum of radii running in FPT (fixed-parameter tractable) time. Our contributions are twofold: We design an iterative covering algorithm that achieves a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation with running time exponential in both $k$ and $m$; We further develop a $(7+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm by leveraging a colorful $k$-center subroutine, improving the running time by removing the exponential dependency on $m$.</description>

      <title>Layered tree-independence number and clique-based separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of Galby, Munaro, and Yang (SoCG 2023) asking whether every graph class of bounded layered tree-independence number admits clique-based separators of sublinear weight, we investigate relations between layered tree-independence number, weight of clique-based separators, clique cover degeneracy and independence degeneracy. In particular, we provide a number of results bounding these parameters on geometric intersection graphs. For example, we show that the layered tree-independence number is $\mathcal{O}(g)$ for $g$-map graphs, $\mathcal{O}(\frac{r}{\tanh r})$ for hyperbolic uniform disk graphs with radius $r$, and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for spherical uniform disk graphs with radius $r$. Our structural results have algorithmic consequences. In particular, we obtain a number of subexponential or quasi-polynomial-time algorithms for weighted problems such as \textsc{Max Weight Independent Set} and \textsc{Min Weight Feedback Vertex Set} on several geometric intersection graphs. Finally, we conjecture that every fractionally tree-independence-number-fragile graph class has bounded independence degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the Plane with Orthogonally Convex Polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first undecidability result on the tiling is the undecidability of translational tiling of the plane with Wang tiles, where there is an additional color matching requirement. Later, researchers obtained several undecidability results on translational tiling problems where the tilings are subject to the geometric shapes of the tiles only. However, all these results are proved by constructing tiles with extremely concave shapes. It is natural to ask: can we obtain undecidability results of translational tiling with convex tiles? Towards answering this question, we prove the undecidability of translational tiling of the plane with a set of 7 orthogonally convex polyominoes.</description>

      <title>On the Vertices of Delta-modular Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a polytope defined by the system $A x \leq b$, where $A \in R^{m \times n}$, $b \in R^m$, and $\text{rank}(A) = n$. We give a short geometric proof of the following tight upper bound on the number of vertices of $P$: $$
  n! \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\text{average}}} \cdot \text{vol}(B_2) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n}} \cdot \left(\frac{2 \pi}{e}\right)^{n/2} \cdot n^{n/2} \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\text{average}}}, $$ where $\Delta$ is the maximum absolute value of $n \times n$ subdeterminants of $A$, and $\Delta_{\text{average}}$ is the average absolute value of subdeterminants of $A$ corresponding to a triangulation of $P$'s normal fan. Assuming that $A$ is integer, such polyhedra are called $\Delta$-modular polyhedra. Note that in the integer case, the bound can be simplified via the inequality $\Delta_{\text{average}} \geq \Delta_{\min} \geq 1$, where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the minimum absolute value of subdeterminants of $A$ corresponding to feasible bases of $A x \leq b$. For this, we prove and use a symmetric variant of Macbeath's theorem.
  Additionally, we give a direct argument based on prior results in the field, showing that the graph diameter of $P$ is bounded by $O\bigl(n^3 \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\min}} \cdot \ln (n \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\min}}) \bigr)$. Thus, both characteristic of $P$ are linear in $\Delta/\Delta_{\min}$.
  From an algorithmic perspective, we demonstrate that:
  Given $A \in Q^{m \times n}$, $b \in Q^m$, and an initial feasible solution to $A x \leq b$, the convex hull of $P$ can be constructed in $O(n)^{n/2} \cdot m^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta}{\Delta_{\text{average}}}$ operations. For simple polyhedra, the dependence on $m$ reduces to linear;
  Given $A \in Z^{m \times n}$ and $b \in Q^m$, the number $|P \cap Z^n|$ can be computed in $O(n)^n \cdot \frac{\Delta^4}{\Delta_{\text{average}}}$ arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>Volumetric Functional Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of volumetric correspondences between 3D shapes has great potential for medical and industrial applications. In this work, we pave the way for spectral volume mapping, extending for the first time the functional maps framework from the surface setting to the volumetric domain. We show that the eigenfunctions of the volumetric Laplace operator define a functional space that is suitable for high-quality signal transfer. We also experiment with various techniques that edit this functional space, porting them from the surface to the volume setting. We validate our method on novel volumetric datasets and on tetrahedralizations of well established surface datasets, also showcasing practical applications involving both discrete and continuous signal mapping, for segmentation transfer, mesh connectivity transfer and solid texturing. Last but not least, we show that considering the volumetric spectrum greatly improves the accuracy for classical shape matching tasks among surfaces, consistently outperforming existing surface-only spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Covering radii of $3$-zonotopes and the shifted Lonely Runner Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the shifted Lonely Runner Conjecture (sLRC) holds for 5 runners. We also determine that there are exactly 3 primitive tight instances of the conjecture, only two of which are tight for the non-shifted conjecture (LRC). Our proof is computational, relying on a rephrasing of the sLRC in terms of covering radii of certain zonotopes (Henze and Malikiosis, 2017), and on an upper bound for the (integer) velocities to be checked (Malikiosis, Santos and Schymura, 2024+).
  As a tool for the proof, we devise an algorithm for bounding the covering radius of rational lattice polytopes, based on constructing dyadic fundamental domains.</description>

      <title>No-dimensional Tverberg-type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Adiprasito et al. have initiated the study of the so-called no-dimensional Tverberg problem. This problem can be informally stated as follows: Given $n\geq k$, partition an $n$-point set in Euclidean space into $k$ parts such that their convex hulls intersect a ball of relatively small radius.
  In this survey, we aim to present the recent progress towards solving the no-dimensional Tverberg problem and new open questions arising in its context. Also, we discuss the colorful variation of this problem and its algorithmic aspects, particularly focusing on the case when each part of a partition contains exactly 2 points. The latter turns out to be related to the following no-dimensional Tverberg-type problem of Huemer et al.: For an even set of points in Euclidean space, find a perfect matching such that the balls with diameters induced by its edges intersect.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology of Music Network with Three Different Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology has been widely used to discover hidden topological structures in data across various applications, including music data. To apply persistent homology, a distance or metric must be defined between points in a point cloud or between nodes in a graph network. These definitions are not unique and depend on the specific objectives of a given problem. In other words, selecting different metric definitions allows for multiple topological inferences. In this work, we focus on applying persistent homology to music graph with predefined weights. We examine three distinct distance definitions based on edge-wise pathways and demonstrate how these definitions affect persistent barcodes, persistence diagrams, and birth/death edges. We found that there exist inclusion relations in one-dimensional persistent homology reflected on persistence barcode and diagram among these three distance definitions. We verified these findings using real music data.</description>

      <title>Largest dyadic dual VC-dimension of non-piercing families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dyadic dual VC-dimension of a set system \( \mathcal{F} \) is the largest integer \( \ell \) such that there exist \( \ell \) sets \( F_1, F_{2}, \dots, F_\ell \in \mathcal{F} \), where every pair \( \{i, j\} \in \binom{[\ell]}{2} \) is witnessed by an element \( a_{i,j} \in F_i \cap F_j \) that does not belong to any other set \( F_k \) with \( k \in [\ell] \setminus \{i, j\} \). In this paper, we determine the largest dyadic dual VC-dimension of a non-piercing family is exactly $4$, providing a rare example where the maximum of this parameter can be determined for a natural family arising from geometry. As an application, we give a short and direct proof that the transversal number \( \tau(\mathcal{F}) \) of any non-piercing family is at most \(C\nu(\mathcal{F})^9 \), where \( \nu(\mathcal{F}) \) is the matching number and $C$ is a constant. This improves a recent result of P\'{a}lv\"{o}lgyi and Z\'{o}lomy.</description>
