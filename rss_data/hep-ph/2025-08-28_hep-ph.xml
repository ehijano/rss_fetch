      <title>Semi-inclusive pion electroproduction at the highest transverse momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the energies of present and future electron accelerators designed to study the structure of hadrons, there is a regime where hard pion electroproduction proceeds by a perturbatively calculable process in QCD. The process is not the leading twist fragmentation one but rather a higher twist process that produces kinematically isolated pions. Semi-inclusive data may teach us more about parton distribution functions of the target and the pion distribution amplitude. In addition, there is a connection to generalized parton distribution calculations of exclusive electroproduction of mesons in that the perturbative kernel is the same.</description>

      <title>Prospects for relic neutrino detection using nuclear spin experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) remains one of the most formidable experimental challenges in modern physics. In this work, we extend recent studies of C$\nu$B-induced coherent transitions in polarised nuclear spin ensembles. Adopting an open quantum system framework, we model coherent neutrino effects in large spin ensembles using a Lindblad master equation that also incorporates realistic experimental imperfections such as local dephasing and imperfect polarisation. We solve the Lindblad equation numerically by way of a fast and computationally inexpensive method that can be extended to an arbitrarily large number of spins. Using our numerical solutions, we forecast the sensitivities of future experiments such as CASPEr to the local C$\nu$B overdensity parameter $\delta_\nu$. Our findings indicate that a CASPEr-like experiment, though primarily aimed at axion dark matter search, could also constrain the C$\nu$B overdensity to $\delta_\nu \sim 10^{9}-10^{11}$ in configurations achievable by currently planned experimental efforts, and down to $\delta_\nu \sim 10^7$ in the most optimised scenario. While C$\nu$B detection remains out of reach in the foreseeable future, our results highlight the potential of using quantum sensing to probe fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Unitarity test of lepton mixing via energy dependence of neutrino oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the method to test the unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix by using only the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, such as the combination of the T2HK experiment and the one with the $\nu_e$ beam from a future neutrino factory at J-PARC. Without a specific parametrization, one can directly extract the elements of the lepton mixing matrix by observing the energy dependence of the oscillation probabilities. A non-trivial test of the unitarity under the three-generation assumption can thus be made possible by examining the orthogonality in a similar manner to the unitarity triangle in the quark sector. As the first trial, we perform the analysis based on the simplified situation where the matter effects in the neutrino oscillation can be neglected. Under this simplified analysis, we demonstrate the observation of the unitarity violation in the $3\times3$ part of the lepton mixing matrix for a parameter set in the four-generation model. The statistically most significant measurement can be provided by the energy dependences of the combination of the CP conjugate modes, $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ and $\bar \nu_\mu \to \bar \nu_e$, at T2HK and, independently, by the T conjugate modes, $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ and $\nu_e \to \nu_\mu$, with the latter measured at the neutrino factory experiments.</description>

      <title>Signals for fluctuating constituent numbers in small systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the initial condition model TRENTo for sampling the number of partons inside the nucleons that participate in a heavy-ion collision. This sampling method is based on parton distribution functions (PDFs) and therefore has a natural dependence on the momentum transferred in the collision and the scale being probed during the collision. We examine the resulting distributions and their dependence on the momentum transfer. Additionally, we explore the sensitivity of different observables on the number of partons using the TRENTo framework and the estimators available therein for final-state observables.</description>

      <title>Post-Reheating Inflaton Production as a Probe of Reheating Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological reheating bridges the inflationary epoch and the hot big bang phase, yet its underlying dynamics remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate a minimal scenario in which the inflaton evolves under a simple power-law potential during reheating and interacts with other particles via renormalizable couplings. We show that inflaton quanta can be regenerated from the thermal bath even after the decay of the coherent inflaton field, unveiling a previously overlooked channel for inflaton particle production, which offers a novel window into probing reheating. Remarkably, this mechanism may also account for the observed dark matter abundance, providing a natural link between early Universe dynamics and present-day cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Toward 48 dB Spin Squeezing and 96 dB Signal Magnification for Cosmic Relic Searches with Nuclear Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently showed that macroscopic nuclear spin ensembles prepared in coherent spin states can dramatically enhance the interaction rates of weakly interacting cosmic relics-such as dark matter and the cosmic neutrino background-through collective quantum effects analogous to Dicke superradiance, where the de-excitation and excitation rates scale as the square of the number of spins, $N^2$. We thus coined these processes superradiant interactions. In this paper, we propose a protocol to realize this enhancement and boost the discovery potential for such relics. We show how concepts from quantum optics can be adapted to nuclear spins coupled to superconducting circuits, enabling high-sensitivity systems. The spins are first initialized into a coherent spin state via a $\pi/2$ Rabi pulse from the ground state. When the circuit is sufficiently detuned from resonance, the spin-circuit interaction implements a squeezing Hamiltonian. Because squeezing must outpace spin relaxation and dephasing, the protocol favors macroscopic ensembles and high-quality superconducting circuits. During this squeezing phase, the standard quantum variance is reduced by up to 4.8 orders of magnitude-equivalent to 48 dB of squeezing-for circuits with quality factors $Q \sim 10^8$-$10^9$. The signal imprinted on the spins during the squeezing protocol can be magnified by further utilizing the squeezing interactions, easing the requirement for shot-noise-limited readout. This protocol has the potential to significantly accelerate axion and dark photon dark matter searches and extend the reach of existing axion experiments to probe QCD axion-nuclear spin couplings. More broadly, it paves the way for detecting coherent inelastic interactions from other cosmic relics-most notably the cosmic neutrino background-and establishes nuclear-spin-based systems as a new class of quantum, ultra-low-threshold detectors.</description>

      <title>Physics of the gluon mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that the gluon propagator in Landau-gauge QCD exhibits a mass gap; and its emergence has been ascribed to the action of the Schwinger mechanism in the gauge sector of QCD. In the present work, we relate this property to the physical mass gap of QCD by considering two observables associated with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, namely the confinement-deconfinement transition temperature and the pion decay constant, respectively. It turns out that the first observable is linearly proportional to the gluon mass gap, a fact that allows us to assign a direct physical meaning to this scale. Moreover, we identify three distinct momentum regimes in the gluon propagator, ultraviolet, intermediate, and deep infrared, and assess their impact on the aforementioned observables. Both observables are sensitive to the first two regions of momenta, where functional approaches essentially coincide, but are insensitive to the third, deep infrared, regime. The combined information is used for a simple fit for the gluon propagator, all of whose parameters admit a clear physical interpretation. Finally, we discuss how this fit can help us access the intertwined dynamics of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD-type theories.</description>

      <title>Exploring Strangeness Enhancement and Particle Production in Small Collision Systems with EPOS4 at $\sqrt{s_\rm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of collectivity and strangeness enhancement in small collision systems, such as proton-proton (pp) and proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions, challenges traditional assumptions regarding thermalization and particle production mechanisms. In this study, we investigate particle yields and transverse momentum distributions in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\rm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV using the EPOS4 event generator, which employs a core-corona framework to model particle production across a variety of system sizes. EPOS4 successfully reproduces many qualitative trends observed in experimental data, including the hardening of $p_{\rm{T}}$-spectra with multiplicity, the hierarchical strangeness enhancement in strange-to-pion ratios, and characteristic modifications of particle yield ratios as a function of $p_{\rm{T}}$ and multiplicity. The microcanonical approach to core hadronization used in EPOS4 seems to provide a more realistic description of small systems compared to grand-canonical treatments. Nonetheless, quantitative discrepancies still persist in describing several physical observables. Future model refinements, including improved core-corona balancing, differential freeze-out conditions for multi-strange hadrons, and incorporation of finite strangeness correlation volumes, may be taken into account for enhancing EPOS4's predictive power and deepening our understanding of the complex dynamics governing the particle production in high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic properties of heavy-light mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Bethe-Salpeter framework, we present a computation of space-like electromagnetic form factors for pseudoscalar mesons, including light and heavy-light systems. Our approach employs a flavour-dependent variation of the standard Taylor effective charge, which contains key contributions from the quark-gluon vertices. This effective interaction is a common ingredient of all relevant dynamical equations, and accommodates the crucial mass differences between the various quark flavours. Particular attention is paid to the nonperturbative determination of the quark-photon vertex. The computed electromagnetic form factors for the pion and the kaon mesons show excellent agreement with experimental determinations. In addition, the predictions for the charge radii of heavy-light systems are in overall good agreement with lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Single- and double-heavy Hadronic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this presentation the notion of hadronic molecules is reviewed and it is argued that some of the enigmatic single and double heavy mesons, namely the lowest lying positive parity open charm states, the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ aka $X(3872)$, that do not fit into the conventional quark--anti-quark scheme in fact qualify as hadronic molecules. For the single heavy states we show that an alternative explanation as diquark--anti-diquark structure is at odds with either phenomenology or lattice data. For the $X(3872)$ we discuss also the claimed isovector partner state, whose properties would provide additional strong support for a molecular structure of the $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ states near the $D\bar D^{*}$ thresholds. Its existence could be confirmed by, e.g., a high statistics measurement of the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ lineshape from $B^0\to K^0 J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$.</description>

Abstract: We study the (3+1)D structure of the Glasma in the dilute approximation, which allows us to describe the longitudinal dynamics that arise from the three-dimensional nuclear structure. We employ a nuclear model with tunable longitudinal and transverse fluctuation scales that generalizes the McLerran-Venugopalan model. We discuss the longitudinal profiles of the energy-momentum tensor and the transverse structure of the local rest frame energy density.</description>

Abstract: We summarize and update using new NICER measurements the results of arXiv:2401.16253, in which we used various astrophysical neutron-star observations to set an upper bound on the CFL color-superconducting gap in a range of baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B \in [2.1,3.2]$, above those reached within neutron stars. We also corroborate the ``reasonable" constraint from arXiv:2401.16253 on the maximum value of the color-superconducting gap by performing a new Bayesian analysis using a prior that extends a two-segment Gaussian process connecting the whole density range between CEFT and pQCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of precision measurements of photon-fusion processes in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at facilities, such as RHIC and the LHC, the inclusion of higher-order corrections has become essential. While automated frameworks already make NLO corrections feasible for parton-parton scattering processes, no comparable tools had previously been available for UPC processes in two-photon collisions. In these proceedings, we review some recent explicit NLO computations and present the updated gamma-UPC+MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework, the first automated software that enables NLO-accurate predictions for photon-photon processes in UPCs.</description>

      <title>Analytical two-loop amplitudes of $e^{+} e^{-} \longrightarrow \boldsymbol{J} / \boldsymbol{\psi}+\boldsymbol{\eta}_c$ at $B$ factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In double charmonium production, a long-standing challenge is that the theoretical predictions are not consistent with the measurements at B factories. Within the NRQCD framework, the next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation has proved its power to cut down the discrepancy between theory and experiments. To further clarify this puzzle, we have performed the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculation. The amplitude is obtained as an analytical asymptotic expansion in the ratio of the squared charm-quark mass over the squared center-of-mass energy, $m_c^2/s$. We investigate the origin of the leading logarithms by performing a region analysis, revealing the intricate factorization structure in this process. We provide numerical predictions on the total cross sections of $J/\psi+\eta_c$ production, which agree with the experimental results. Extension of our computation to $\Upsilon+\eta_b$ production is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy ions provide rich spectrum of possibilities to discuss the response of the nucleus to photons. Newly published neutron and proton multiplicities measured in the ALICE experiment in ultraperipheral collisions allow investigating the influence of the electromagnetic fields on colliding nuclei for the $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.02~TeV. The theoretical predictions are done within hybrid model including equivalent photon approximations (EPA), GiBUU modeling of pre-equilibrium processes and generation of the exited nuclear remnants, which decay is modeled by statistical approach: GEM2 or GEMINI++. The cross-sections of the mass-charge distributions of nuclear remnants as well as the neutron, proton and other charged particle multiplicities are estimated. We concentrate on production of protons and isotopes coming from the electromagnetic dissociation. Special attention is devoted to emission of a single proton. The cross section for $1p$ emission is very close to maximal available one based on reactions of photon with individual nucleons. Our pre-equilibrium processes explain simultaneously the tail of neutron energy distributions in the nuclear rest frame observed in $\gamma + A$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing Scalar-Mediator Quark Couplings via CLFV Lepton-Nucleon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) deep-inelastic scattering, focusing on the gluon-initiated subprocess $\ell_i g \to \ell_j g$ via the gluon effective operator $\phi\, G_{\mu \nu}^a G_a^{\mu \nu}$, and demonstrate how to probe the nature of the CLFV mediator $\phi$, specifically its mass and interaction with quarks. We consider two benchmark scenarios for the mediator-quark coupling: (i) $h$-like scenario, in which the mediator couples to heavy quarks in proportion to their masses, and (i\hspace{-1pt}i) $b$-only scenario, where the coupling is restricted to bottom quark only. We demonstrate that these scenarios can be discriminated by examining the dependence of the differential cross section on the momentum transfer. Furthermore, we show that the peak position of the differential cross section exhibits a pronounced sensitivity to both the mass of the mediator and the coupling strengths with quarks.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for jet modification in the presence of the QGP background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet interactions with the color-deconfined QCD medium in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are conventionally assessed by measuring the modification of the distributions of jet observables with respect to their baselines in proton-proton collisions. Deep learning methods enable per-jet evaluation of these modifications, enhancing the use of jets as precision probes of the nuclear medium. In this work, we predict the jet-by-jet fractional energy loss $\chi$ for jets evolving through a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium using a Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model. To approximate realistic experimental conditions, we embed medium-modified jets in a thermal background and apply Constituent Subtraction for background removal. Two network architectures are studied: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using jet images, and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) using particle clouds. We find that CNNs achieve accurate predictions for background-free jets but degrade in the presence of the QGP background and remain below the background-free baseline even after background subtraction. In contrast, DGCNNs applied to background-subtracted particle clouds maintain high accuracy across the entire $\chi$ range, demonstrating the advantage of point-cloud-based graph neural networks that exploit full jet structure under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Vectorlike lepton imprints at lepton $g-2$ measurements and $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fermion can be chiral or vectorlike with respect to a given symmetry, depending on its coupling to the corresponding gauge boson. Vectorlike fermions have a distinct property that their left-handed and right-handed components behave in the same way under the gauge symmetry. In this paper, we investigate an extension of the standard model with an $SU(2)$ doublet of vectorlike leptons and two complex scalars. The new physics effects on the lepton anomalous magnetic moment, as well as the electron and muon pair production processes at $e^+e^-$ colliders are analyzed. Taking into account the updated measurement results of the electron and muon $g-2$, the LEP and the LHC data, the viable parameter space of the model is identified. We also examine the prospect of testing the model using $\mu^+\mu^-$ signals from electron-position annihilation at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee). The analysis shows that the FCC-ee will be able to exclude a significant part of the parameter space, pinpointing exiguous viable regions to be tested in the future due to its high precision.</description>

      <title>Novel probes for electron-muon flavor violation from exotic Higgs decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two novel signatures of Higgs decays to search for electron-muon flavor violation. These signatures arise from the presence of a light pseudoscalar into which the 125-GeV Higgs boson decays. The pseudoscalar subsequently decays into an electron-muon pair, leading to multilepton final states, which are relatively clean signatures to search for at the LHC. As a benchmark, we consider the type-III Two-Higgs-doublet-model. We analyze both low-energy and collider constraints on the model and identify regions of parameter space where the light pseudoscalar is viable. Our proposed signatures yield stronger constraints on the lepton flavor violating couplings than current low-energy precision measurements. Taken together, our findings suggest that collider-based probes of exotic Higgs decays provide a powerful complement to precision experiments in the quest to uncover new physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray boosted inelastic dark matter from neutrino-emitting active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays may scatter off dark matter particles in active galactic nuclei, where both the densities of cosmic rays and dark matter are expected to be very large. These scatterings could yield a flux of boosted dark matter particles directly detectable on Earth, which enhances the sensitivity of dark matter direct detection and neutrino experiments to light and inelastic dark matter models. Here we calculate the cosmic-ray boosted dark matter flux from the neutrino-emitting active galactic nuclei, NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, by considering realistic cosmic-ray distributions, deep inelastic scatterings, and mass splittings in the dark sector. From this we derive novel bounds from these sources on light and/or inelastic dark matter models with Super-K and XENONnT. We find that cosmic-ray boosted dark matter from neutrino-emitting active galactic nuclei can test regions of parameter space favored to reproduce the observed relic abundance of dark matter in the Universe, and that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Kinetic Equilibrium in Cosmology: Facts and Myths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify that chemical and kinetic equilibration in the early Universe are distinct: neither implies the other, and the ordering of their decouplings need not be universal. We illustrate this with Standard-Model neutrino decoupling, strong-washout leptogenesis, dark-matter scenarios where kinetic decoupling precedes chemical freeze-out (resonant/forbidden, conversion/coannihilation, coscattering), and dark sectors at with temperatures distinct from the visible-sector temperature, with semi-annihilation or 3 $\to$ 2 cannibal dynamics. The moral of the story is simple: Chemical equilibrium governs numbers, kinetic equilibrium governs shapes. In an expanding Universe the operators that control them rarely fade at the same time, and when they do not, the order of decoupling is model dependent. Turning to phase-space evolution whenever momentum selectivity matters is the surest way to obtain robust cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis via Asymmetric Evaporation of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit baryogenesis from the asymmetric evaporation of light primordial black holes, focusing on scenarios where gravitational effects induce a matter antimatter asymmetry. In particular, we consider a higher-dimension operator coupling the Kretschmann scalar to a baryon-number-violating current which generates an effective chemical potential at the black hole horizon and leads to asymmetric Hawking radiation. Relative to earlier studies, we account for entropy dilution from evaporation, incorporate chemical potential dependent greybody factors and numerically track the fully coupled evolution of a PBH population in an expanding universe. We show that the observed baryon asymmetry can be reproduced within a viable region of parameter space for several PBH mass spectra including log-normal, critical-collapse, and power-law distributions.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Enhanced Probe of Relic Neutrino Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose heavy decaying dark matter (DM) as a new probe of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Heavy DM, with mass $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV, decaying into neutrinos can be a new source of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. Including this contribution along with the measured astrophysical and predicted cosmogenic neutrino fluxes, we study the scattering of UHE neutrinos with the C$\nu$B via standard weak interactions mediated by the $Z$-boson. We solve the complete neutrino transport equation, taking into account both absorption and reinjection effects, to calculate the expected spectrum of UHE neutrino flux at future neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube-Gen2 Radio. We argue that such observations can be used to probe the C$\nu$B properties, and in particular, local C$\nu$B clustering. We find that, depending on the absolute neutrino mass and the DM mass and lifetime, a local C$\nu$B overdensity $\gtrsim 10^6$ can be probed at IceCube-Gen2 Radio within 10 years of data taking.</description>

      <title>A Baryon and Lepton Number Violation Model Testable at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton decay experiments typically constrain baryon number violation to the scale of grand unified theories. From a phenomenological point of view, this makes direct probing of the associated new resonances, such as the X and Y bosons, out of reach for even the most optimistic future experiments. It has, however, been known that certain specific patterns of baryon and lepton number violation can suppress proton decay by multiple powers of the masses of the heavy resonances involved, opening the possibility that the observed limits on the proton lifetime are consistent with baryon number violating physics at energy scales much lower than that of grand unification. We construct an explicit example of such a model which violates baryon number by one unit, $\Delta \text{B} = -1$, and lepton number by three units, $\Delta \text{L} = -3$, and show that despite stringent limits on the predicted $p \rightarrow e^{+}/\mu^{+} \overline{\nu}\overline{\nu}$ mode from the Super-Kamiokande experiment, the masses of the newly introduced elementary particles can be $\mathcal{O}$(TeV). We identify interesting unique signatures of baryon number violation of this model that can be probed both with currently available LHC data and with the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC. We also present a scenario for low-scale baryogenesis within the framework of this model.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Love of Black Holes in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes in General Relativity exhibit a remarkable feature: their response to static scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations -- as quantified by the so-called tidal Love numbers -- vanishes identically. We present the first exception to this rule: the Love numbers of a black hole perturbed by a fermionic field are nonzero. We derive a closed-form expression of these fermionic Love numbers for generic spin in the background of a Kerr black hole with arbitrary angular momentum. In contrast, we show that the fermionic dissipation numbers vanish for static perturbations, reflecting the absence of superradiance for fermions. These results highlight a fundamental distinction between bosonic and fermionic perturbations, which can be interpreted as a breaking of the hidden symmetries that underlie the vanishing of Love numbers in the bosonic sector.</description>

      <title>Chaos and Carter: Extreme-mass-ratio systems of relativistic rotating black holes in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, where a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole, are prime sources of millihertz gravitational waves for upcoming space-based detectors. While most studies assume idealized vacuum backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in astrophysical environments, such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark matter spikes, disks and halos, that can significantly alter the orbital dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time, and map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of chaos. This manifests through resonant island and chaotic layer formations around transient orbital resonances in phase space; features that are otherwise completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit points. Non-integrability ensures that the periodicity of the central resonant point is shared throughout the island's geodesics, thus effectively enhancing the lifespan of resonances, beyond Kerr-based predictions. Therefore, they can subject distinct imprint on gravitational-wave signals, with significant consequences for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>$F$-term Multi-Field Inflation in Supergravity without Stabiliser Superfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realising $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to the well-known $\eta$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the K\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic instabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens the theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity.</description>

      <title>Two-particle number and transverse momentum balance function with event-topology in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first study of charge-dependent two-particle differential number ($B$) and momentum balance functions ($P_{2}^{CD}$) with respect to an event shape variable, transverse spherocity, is reported. Results are presented from PYTHIA8 and EPOS-LHC model calculations in proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. To distinguish between back-to-back jet-like topologies and isotropic events, low and high transverse spherocity values are chosen. The correlation functions are measured as a function of averaged charged-particle multiplicity ($\langle N_{ch}\rangle$) in relative pseudorapidity ($\Delta\eta$) and relative azimuthal angle ($\Delta\phi$) with $|\eta| &lt; 2.4$ and $0.2 &lt; p_{T} &lt; 2.0$ GeV. A narrowing of the balance function width is observed in $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$ from low- to high-multiplicity collisions. Wider balance functions are found in isotropic events as compared to jet-like events. However, for the momentum correlations, a nearly flat dependence is observed with $\langle N_{ch}\rangle$. This study investigates charge conservation mechanisms and their correlations for events classified with jet-like and isotropic topologies. To isolate medium-driven effects, we compare EPOS-LHC with its hydrodynamic core enabled and disabled and observed narrowing patterns in $B$ and $P_{2}^{CD}$ as a quantitative handle on radial-flow-induced localization of charge-balancing pairs.</description>

      <title>Machine learning topological defect formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the density of topological defects created during a second-order phase transition is determined by the correlation length at the freeze-out time. This suggests that the final configuration of topological defects in such a transition is largely established during the impulse regime, soon after the critical point is traversed. Motivated by this, we conjecture that machine learning (ML) can predict the final configuration of topological defects based on the time evolution of the order parameter over a short interval in the vicinity of the critical point, well before the order parameter settles into the emerging new minima resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we show that the predictability of ML also follows the power law scaling dictated by KZM. We demonstrate these using a Recurrent Neural Network.</description>

Abstract: We propose to trap circular Rydberg atoms (CRAs) by a ponderomotive potential well formed with a superimposed vortex light beam. We calculate analytically the ponderomotive potential energy for a Bessel vortex light beam. We work out a corrected version of the classical circular orbit approximation for a CRA which fits the exact result much better than the usual approximation. We reveal the three-dimensional characteristics of the potential well for some benchmark values of the CRA principal quantum number and beam parameters such as the frequency, the opening angle and topological charge of the vortex. We investigate how we can achieve similar trapping effects for different principal quantum numbers by varying beam parameters. The potential provides a lattice structure in the beam axis where one CRA could be trapped at each lattice site.</description>

      <title>On cusps in the $\eta'$ potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large $N$ analysis of QCD states that the potential for the $\eta'$ meson develops cusps at $\eta' = \pi / N_f$, $3 \pi /N_f$, $\cdots$, with $N_f$ the number of flavors. Furthermore, the recent discussion of generalized anomalies tells us that even for finite $N$ there should be cusps if $N$ and $N_f$ are not coprime, as one can show that the domain wall configuration of $\eta'$ should support a Chern-Simons theory on it, i.e., domains are not smoothly connected. On the other hand, there is a supporting argument for instanton-like, smooth potentials of $\eta'$ from the analyses of softly-broken supersymmetric QCD for $N_f= N-1$, $N$, and $N+1$. We argue that the analysis of the $N_f = N$ case should be subject to the above anomaly argument, and thus there should be a cusp; while the $N_f = N \pm 1$ cases are consistent, as $N_f$ and $N$ are coprime. We discuss how this cuspy/smooth transition can be understood. For $N_f&lt; N$, we find that the number of branches of the $\eta'$ potential is $\operatorname{gcd}(N,N_f)$, which is the minimum number allowed by the anomaly. We also discuss the condition for s-confinement in QCD-like theories, and find that in general the anomaly matching of the $\theta$ periodicity indicates that s-confinement can only be possible when $N_f$ and $N$ are coprime. The s-confinement in supersymmetric QCD at $N_f = N+1$ is a famous example, and the argument generalizes for any number of fermions in the adjoint representation.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratio method in three-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model, we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point. We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is also useful for the search for the critical point.</description>

      <title>Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter 2025 Proceedings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third ``Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter'' (MD$\nu$DM'25) meeting was held May 20-23, 2025 in Yokohama, Japan, hosted by the Yokohama Institute for Earth Sciences, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). These proceedings compile contributions from the workshop and update the progress of mineral detector research. MD$\nu$DM'25 was the third such meeting, following the first in October of 2022 held at the IFPU in Trieste, Italy and the second in January of 2024 hosted by the Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech in Arlington, USA. Mineral detectors record and retain damage induced by nuclear recoils in synthetic or natural mineral samples. The damage features can then be read out by a variety of nano- and micro-scale imaging techniques. Applications of mineral detectors on timescales relevant for laboratory experiments include reactor neutrino monitoring and dark matter detection, with the potential to measure the directions as well as the energies of the induced nuclear recoils. For natural mineral detectors which record nuclear recoils over geological timescales, reading out even small mineral samples could be sensitive to rare interactions induced by astrophysical neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and heavy exotic particles. A series of mineral detectors of different ages could measure the time evolution of these fluxes, offering a unique window into the history of our solar system and the Milky Way. Mineral detector research is highly multidisciplinary, incorporating aspects of high energy physics, condensed matter physics, materials science, geoscience, and AI/ML for data analysis. Although realizing the scientific potential of mineral detectors poses many challenges, the MD$\nu$DM community looks forward to the continued development of mineral detector experiments and the possible discoveries that mineral detectors could reveal.</description>

      <title>$\Xi NN$ three-baryon force from SU(3) chiral effective field theory: A femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The development of SU(3) chiral effective field theory has opened the way to a systematic exploration of three-baryon forces (3BFs), a key ingredient in hypernuclear and dense matter physics. However, $\Xi NN$ 3BF based on SU(3) chiral EFT has not been studied until now.
  Purpose: We apply SU(3) chiral EFT for the first time to derive $\Xi NN$ potentials in momentum space. Then, we investigate how the $\Xi NN$ 3BF affects the correlation function of deuteron-$\Xi^-$ pair created through heavy-ion collisions.
  Methods: To reduce the number of low-energy constants involved in the $\Xi NN$ potentials, we employ the decuplet saturation approximation, by which only two of them remain unconstrained.
  Results: We found that the effect of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF on the deuteron-$\Xi^-$ correlation function is at most about 4%. This is because the deuteron and $\Xi^-$ interact with each other mainly at low momentum, corresponding to peripheral scattering, where the influence of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF is limited.
  Conclusions: High-momentum scattering of the deuteron off $\Xi^-$ is expected to be a promising probe of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF, offering an alternative to femtoscopic analyses of the correlation function.</description>

      <title>Medium effects on the electromagnetic form factors of $\rho$ meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of partons inside the light $\rho$ meson is found to be essential for its properties and internal structure, both in free space and in the nuclear medium. In this paper, we systematically investigate the in-medium structure changes of $\rho^+$ mesons within the covariant Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, utilizing the Schwinger proper-time regularization scheme. We solve the Bethe-Salpeter equations to guarantee the bound meson-state condition. At the quark level, the nuclear medium effects are also derived within the same NJL model to maintain a consistent approach with the in-medium $\rho^+$ meson electromagnetic form factors. To this end, we analyze the spacelike electromagnetic form factors of the $\rho^+$ meson in free space and in a nuclear medium. We find that the charge radius and quadrupole moment of the $\rho^+$ meson increase with increasing nuclear matter density, while the magnetic moment decreases, in agreement with the existing previous theoretical predictions. The enhancement of the $\rho^+$ meson charge radius at normal density relative to that in free space is about 11\% (0.08 fm), while the reduction of $\rho^+$ meson magnetic moment is about 8\% (0.20 $\mu_N$). Our predictions for the charge radius, magnetic moment, and quadrupole moment of the $\rho^+$ meson in both free space and nuclear medium, remain challenging to be verified experimentally.</description>

      <title>Heavy quarkonia and new hadrons with two heavy quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to heavy quarkonia -- bound states of a heavy quark and its antiquark (e.g., charmonium $c\bar{c}$, bottomonium $b\bar{b}$) -- as well as to the exotic hadrons containing two heavy quarks that have been discovered since 2003. The review covers the foundational discoveries ($J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$), basic properties, spectroscopy interpreted via potential models, production mechanisms at colliders, and decay modes. A significant focus is placed on the so-called ``$XYZ$" states -- particles like the $X(3872)$, $Y(4260/4230)$, $Z_c(3900)$, and $P_c$ -- whose properties defy conventional quark model expectations. These states, considered candidates for hybrids, multi-quark states, hadronic molecules, or hadroquarkonia, provide unprecedented probes of non-perturbative QCD and challenge our understanding of quark confinement and hadron formation. The chapter summarizes the current experimental landscape and highlights key open questions driving future research in hadron spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) show some tension with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For one, the cosmological parameters determined by the CMB are at odds with the expansion history determined by latest BAO measurements. In addition, the combined data has placed uncomfortably strong constraints on neutrino mass. Both effects can be interpreted as negative neutrino mass, one describing the change to the expansion history and the other one describing enhanced lensing. In this paper, we show the current tensions can be solved with a single change either to the lensing of the CMB or the expansion of the universe. We show additional lensing could arise from a variety of models with new light fields. However, these models rarely give the same signal in temperature and polarization, giving a concrete test of the scenario. Alternatively, dark sector models can explain the changes to the expansion by changing the evolution of the matter density. These models introduce new forces, giving rise to long range signals in the three-point statistics of galaxies. We discuss a range of other examples which all illustrate the pattern that additional signals should appear if these tensions are explained by beyond the Standard Model physics.</description>

      <title>System size and event shape dependence of particle-identified balance functions in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate charge balance functions for identified hadron pairs (pions, kaons, and protons) in proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV, using transverse spherocity to classify event topology and charged particle multiplicity to select system size. Simulations with PYTHIA8 and EPOS-LHC reveal that balance function widths in rapidity and azimuthal angle depend on multiplicity and event shape. In PYTHIA8, widths decrease monotonically with multiplicity, consistent with local charge conservation in a fragmentation-dominated scenario. In contrast, the EPOS-LHC model, especially when using the core corona implementation, exhibits a more intricate response, where the combined effects of hydrodynamic radial flow and longitudinal diffusion result in narrower azimuthal correlations and broader rapidity correlations. These features are characteristic signatures of collective dynamics, similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions. Events with low spherocity, which are jet-like in nature, exhibit significantly narrower balance function widths compared to isotropic events with high spherocity, illustrating that event shape selection provides clear sensitivity to the underlying dynamics of particle production in pp collisions. The species dependence and event-shape sensitivity of the widths provide differential probes of hadronization dynamics and collectivity in small systems. These results demonstrate that multidimensional, particle-identified balance function measurements can disentangle the underlying mechanisms of charge correlations and medium-like behavior in high-multiplicity pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Logarithmic Model Extensions of Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address various cosmological phenomenologies in the symmetric teleparallel framework both in background and perturbation such as cosmic expansion, gravitational coupling constant, gravitational waves propagation. Focusing on logarithmic extensions of $f(Q)$ models, we performed Bayesian analysis using the most-recent cosmological data, DESI DR2, Pantheon+. We also utilized a compilation of redshift space distortions ($f \sigma_8$) dataset to constrain the growth of structures in each of the models modulated by the effective gravitational coupling. We find that our extended Logarithmic $f(Q)$ models are well-constrained by the current cosmological data and are able to describe the late-time cosmic acceleration. The inverse Logarithmic model we introduce is also able to accommodate a phantom-like dark energy equation of state at late times, which is consistent with the recent DESI DR2 observations. We report explicitly predictions for the effective gravitational coupling ($\mu$), and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave ($\nu$) solely based on the background data, which can be tested against future observations. While the two Log-based extensions we have introduced here perform equivalently on the background level, they provide contrasting predictions for the evolution of effective Gravitational constant and propagation of gravitational waves, which should be constrained against the future perturbation data.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Fermion-Rotor System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the fermion-rotor system, a simple impurity model in d=1+1 dimensions that consists of a collection of purely right-moving fermions interacting with a quantum mechanical rotor localised at the origin. This was first introduced by Polchinski as a toy model for monopole-fermion scattering and is surprisingly subtle, with ingoing and outgoing fermions carrying different quantum numbers. We show that the rotor acts as a twist operator in the low-energy theory, changing the quantum numbers of excitations that have previously passed through the origin to ensure scattering consistent with all symmetries.
  We further show how generalisations of this model with multiple rotors and unequal charges can be viewed as a UV-completion of boundary states for chiral theories, including the well-studied 3450 model. We compute correlation functions between ingoing and outgoing fermions and show that fermions dressed with the rotor degree of freedom act as local operators and create single-particle states, generalising an earlier result obtained in a theory with a single rotor and equal charges. Finally, we point out a mod 2 anomaly in these models that descends from the Witten anomaly in 4d</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis and first-order QCD transition with gravitational waves from a large lepton asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large primordial lepton asymmetry can lead to successful baryogenesis by preventing the restoration of electroweak symmetry at high temperatures, thereby suppressing the sphaleron rate. This asymmetry can also lead to a first-order cosmic QCD transition, accompanied by detectable gravitational wave (GW) signals. By employing next-to-leading order dimensional reduction we determine that the necessary lepton asymmetry is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. Incorporating an updated QCD equation of state that harmonizes lattice and functional QCD outcomes, we pinpoint the range of lepton flavor asymmetries capable of inducing a first-order cosmic QCD transition. To maintain consistency with observational constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, achieving the correct baryon asymmetry requires entropy dilution by approximately a factor of ten. However, the first-order QCD transition itself can occur independently of entropy dilution. We propose that the sphaleron freeze-in mechanism can be investigated through forthcoming GW experiments such as $\mu$Ares.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) can form a stable equilibrium configuration, the so-called FDM soliton. In principle, given the FDM particle mass, the profile of the FDM soliton is fixed. In practice, however, there is a great diversity of structures in the Universe. Possible causes of such diversity can lie in such sources as the gravitoelectric field due to a central supermassive black hole, the gravitomagnetic field due to the system angular momentum, an extra denser and compact FDM soliton and an ellipsoidal baryon background. We find that the effects of the gravitomagnetic field due to the soliton's self-angular momentum are very weak while those of the other sources are considerable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two Higgs doublet models with gauged U(1)_H symmetry, motivated by the excesses around 96 GeV reported by the CMS collaboration in the searches for light resonances decaying to two photons and two \tau's. In this model, one Higgs doublet field is charged under the U(1)_H symmetry to avoid tree-level flavor changing neutral currents. The extra gauge symmetry requires extra chiral fermions, to satisfy the anomaly-free conditions. We analyze the signals of the light resonances, taking into account the contribution of the extra fermions, and discuss the consistency with the experimental results in this model.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of singlet-doublet dark matter relic: annihilation, co-annihilation, co-scattering, and freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The singlet-doublet vector-like fermion dark matter model has been extensively studied in the literature over the past decade. An important parameter in this model is the singlet-doublet mixing angle ($\sin\theta$). All the previous studies have primarily focused on annihilation and co-annihilation processes for obtaining the correct dark matter relic density, assuming that the singlet and doublet components decouple at the same epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption holds only for larger mixing angles with a dependency on the mass of the dark matter. However, it badly fails for the mixing angle $\sin\theta&lt;0.05$. We present a systematic study of the parameter space of the singlet-doublet dark matter relic, incorporating annihilation, co-annihilation, and, for the first time, co-scattering processes. Additionally, non-thermal productions via the freeze-in and SuperWIMP mechanism are also explored. We found that due to the inclusion of co-scattering processes, the correct relic density parameter space is shifted towards the detection sensitivity range of the LHC and MATHUSLA via displaced vertex signatures.</description>

Abstract: We investigate nuclear modification and the universality of short-range correlation (SRC) in pion-induced Drell-Yan process. Employing nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and pion PDFs, the ratio of differential cross sections of different nuclei relative to the free nucleon is presented. A kind of universal modification function was proposed which would provide nontrivial tests of SRC universality on the platform of pion-induced Drell-Yan. This work improves our understanding of nuclear structure and strong interactions.</description>

      <title>A general upper bound on the light dark matter scattering rate in materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining an effective theory description of spin-1/2 dark matter (DM)-electron interactions in materials with linear response theory provides a powerful framework to model the scattering of DM, including in-medium effects, in detectors used for direct searches. Within this framework, we show that the rate of DM-induced electronic transitions in detector materials admits a theoretical upper bound under general assumptions on the underlying DM-electron coupling. In particular, our theoretical upper bound applies to models where DM couples to the electron density as well as the spin, paramagnetic and Rashba currents in materials, and arises from the Kramers-Kronig relations that constrain the analytic properties of the scattering rate. We evaluate our maximum rate formula numerically for Ar, Xe, Ge, and Si targets and find that Ge and Si detectors are closer to saturate this theoretical upper bound, but still far from saturation when DM couples to densities or currents which are different from the electron density. This motivates the exploration of a different class of materials to effectively probe such coupling forms.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Thomson coefficient of quark-gluon plasma in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field</title>

Abstract: Heavy-ion collision experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider offer a unique platform to study several key properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of strongly interacting matter. Quarks, being the electrically charged particles, can induce an electric current in the medium in response to the temperature gradients. Hence, the QGP medium can behave like a thermoelectric medium. The thermoelectric coefficients, such as the Seebeck and Thomson coefficients, can help us to understand the intricate transport phenomenon of the medium. In peripheral collisions, the intense, transient, and time-dependent magnetic field created due to spectator protons significantly influences the thermoelectric properties of the QGP medium, affecting the charge and heat transport. This work uses the quasi-particle model to calculate the Thomson coefficient in QGP. The Thomson effect, describing the continuous heating or cooling of the charge-carrying medium in the presence of temperature gradients, remains largely unexplored in QGP. The Seebeck effect, which relates temperature gradients to induced electric fields, has been widely studied in the literature. For the first time, we calculate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. We have studied their dependence on temperature, baryon chemical potential, center of mass energy, and time-dependent magnetic field with different decay parameters. The transverse Thomson effect originates due to the presence of the Nernst effect in the presence of a magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the higher-order thermoelectric transport properties of the QGP medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Production of leptonium in heavy quarkonium decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lepton pairs with opposite charges can form bound states known as ``leptonium'' through quantum electrodynamic interactions. Heavy quarkonia such as $J/\psi$ are abundantly produced at facilities like BESIII and the future Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). In this work, we investigate leptonium production in heavy quarkonium decays, specifically focusing on the processes ${\cal{Q}} \longrightarrow (l_1^+ l_2^-)[n] +\gamma$ ($l_{1,2}= \tau,\, \mu,\, e$) and ${\cal{Q}} \longrightarrow (l_1^+ l_2^-)[n] + l_1^- l_2^+$. Here, ${\cal{Q}}$ denotes the heavy quarkonium $J/\psi$ or $\Upsilon$, while $n=$ ${^1S_0}$ or $^3S_1$ corresponds to para-leptonium and ortho-leptonium, respectively. With an annual production of $3.4 \times 10^{12}$ $J/\psi$ events at STCF, there is significant potential to observe positronium $(e^+e^-)$, muonium $(\mu^+e^-)$, and dimuonium $(\mu^+\mu^-)$. In particular, the ortho-dimuonium $(\mu^+\mu^-)[^3S_1]$ may be discovered at the future STCF, with an inclusive branching fraction of $Br(J/\psi \longrightarrow (\mu^+\mu^-)[^3S_1] +X) = 1.5 \times 10^{-12}$.</description>

      <title>Charmed Meson Structure across Crossover from SU(4) Polyakov Quark Meson Model with Isospin Asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Polyakov Quark Meson (PQM) model is extended to SU(4) flavor symmetry by incorporating the charm quark and introducing a finite isospin asymmetry. This model incorporates the light, strange, and charm chiral condensates, along with the Polyakov-loop variables, to describe the confinement--deconfinement phase transition in a thermal and dense QCD medium. The inclusion of the charm quark condensate enhances the capability of the SU(4) PQM model to explore the spatial and thermal resolution of the chiral phase structure, particularly in the crossover and high-temperature regimes. We construct the QCD phase diagram ($T/T_\chi-\mu_I/m_\pi$) plane, indicating a decrease in the pseudo-critical temperature as the isospin chemical potential increases and explore thermodynamic quantities related to the QCD equation of state at very high temperatures. Fluctuations of quark flavors, conserved charges and baryon-charm correlations are studied across a wide temperature range. The SU(4) PQM model exhibits good qualitative agreement with lattice QCD calculations. Additionally, we calculate the meson mass spectrum at zero and finite temperature, showing that the charm sector remains thermally stable over a wide temperature range. Overall, this study highlights the capability of the SU(4) PQM model to describe key features of QCD matter at high temperatures and its relevance to heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>New resonances at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the large QCD background, tt spectroscopy is poorly doing at LHC with the exception of a toponium type candidate observed with high statistical significance by CMS. Our previous work offers an alternate interpretation of this narrow resonance as a Kaluza Klein graviton. For heavy scalars, following ATLAS and CMS, we describe how the top loop contribution to the gluon-gluon fusion mechanisms could produce a dip rather than a bump in the mass distribution, which prevents genuine searches for heavy resonances. It seems that A470 and H650 resonances, indicated by other channels, as described in our previous work, start to be visible in the tt channel in RUN2 analyses presented by ATLAS and CMS. An NMSSM interpretation does not seem excluded, although the mass difference between these two resonances comes as a surprise. The KK graviton scenario is updated from our previous work, offering promising discoveries of charged and neutral resonances at RUN3. It allows to interpret a recent evidence for an excess in the four-top final state. It predicts an excess of h125h125 final states measurable at HL-LHC. This scenario also offers excellent prospects for abundantly producing a sequence of narrow resonances at future e+e- colliders. The present note summarises these arguments and describes available indications, complementing our collection of evidences for BSM resonances in view of electing a future collider.</description>

      <title>Collins function for pion-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions: a test of universality and factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated study of the Collins azimuthal asymmetries for pion-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions. To this aim, we employ a recent extraction of the transversity and Collins fragmentation functions from semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into hadron pairs processes, obtained within a simplified transverse momentum dependent (TMD) approach at leading order and adopting a collinear configuration for the initial state. Our theoretical estimates, when compared against 200~GeV and 510~GeV data from the STAR Collaboration, show a generally good agreement for the distributions in the transverse momentum of the jet, the pion longitudinal momentum fraction and its transverse momentum with respect to the jet direction. This corroborates the hypothesis of the universality of the Collins function as well as of the TMD factorization for such processes and, once again, of a reduced impact of the proper TMD evolution on azimuthal asymmetries. We will also present predictions based on an extraction of the Collins and transversity distributions where information from data on single spin asymmetry for inclusive pion production in $p^\uparrow p$ collisions is included through a Bayesian reweighting procedure.</description>

      <title>Explaining Data Anomalies over the NMSSM Parameter Space with Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent results from particle physics analyses, we investigate the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) as a framework capable of accommodating a range of current data anomalies across low- and high-energy experiments. These include the so-called 95GeV and 650GeV excesses from Higgs studies, the Electro-Weakino excess from Supersymmetry searches, the latest $(g-2)_\mu$ measurements as well as potential deviations from Standard Model (SM) predictions that would appear as a consequence in mono-$H$ (where $H=h_{\rm SM}$) and -$Z$ signatures of Dark Matter. Our analysis demonstrates that viable NMSSM parameter regions exist where all these features can be accommodated at the $2\sigma$ level while remaining consistent with the most up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. To identify such regions, we employ an efficient numerical scanning strategy assisted by deep learning techniques. We further present several benchmark points that realize these scenarios, offering promising directions for future phenomenological studies.</description>

Abstract: Approximating neutrino oscillations as subgrid physics is an appealing prospect for simulators of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers. Because flavor instabilities quickly lead to quasisteady states in oscillation calculations, it is widely believed that flavor mixing can be approximated in astrophysical simulations by mapping unstable states onto the appropriate asymptotic ones. Subgrid models of this kind, however, are not self-consistent. The miscidynamic theory of quantum-coherent gases furnishes a subgrid model that is.</description>

Abstract: We show that the existence of massive neutron stars and asymptotic freedom of QCD place robust upper bounds on the lowest sound speed of the ultra-dense matter unattainable in neutron stars. Centered on worst-case scenarios, our limits are the most conservative among physical equations of state in the density range $\sim 2-40 n_0$. Discovery of $\gtrsim 2.6 M_\odot$ neutron stars, in combination with current multimessenger astrophysical constraints on the equation of state, would strongly support first-order phase transitions at high baryon densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state.
  In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions, formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows within a given approximation.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star with Dark Matter Admixture: A Candidate for Bridging the Mass Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars, white dwarfs and black holes are the after death remnants of massive stars. However, according to the most recent observations, the neutron stars maximum mass is between $2.0-2.5 M_{\odot}$ while black holes of less than 5 $M_{\odot}$ has not yet been observed. The region between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole is called the mass-gap. If indeed its existence is confirmed by future observations, that indicates a gap in our understanding which seeks for explanation. In addition, the existence of compact objects within the mass-gap should also be supported with the help of possible new theoretical scenarios. In this study, we propose a possible explanation for the existence of compact objects within the mass-gap region. Specifically, we propose that the mass-gap region could be bridged by the existence of a hybrid compact object, composed of hadronic and self interacting and non-annihilating fermionic dark matter, considering that the interaction between these two fluids it is only gravitational. Fundamental questions about how these objects form and how they can be detected are also addressed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate neutrino transport is crucial for reliably modeling explosive astrophysical events like core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs). However, in these extremely neutrino-dense systems, flavor oscillations exhibit challenging nonlinear effects rooted in neutrino-neutrino forward scattering. Evidence is quickly accumulating that these collective phenomena can substantially affect explosion dynamics, neutrino and gravitational-wave signals, nucleosynthesis, and kilonova light curves. We review the progress made so far on the difficult and conceptually deep question of how to correctly include this physics in simulations of CCSNe and NSMs. Our aim is to take a broad view of where the problem stands, and so provide a critical assessment of where it is headed.</description>

      <title>Constraining Mixed Dark Matter models with high redshift Lyman-alpha forest data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study sets new constraints on Cold+Warm Dark Matter (CWDM) models by leveraging the small-scale suppression of structure formation imprinted in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Using the Sherwood-Relics suite, we extract high-fidelity flux power spectra from simulated Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, spanning a broad range of cosmologies and thermal histories. This enables precise constraints on the warm dark matter (WDM) fraction, $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$, and the mass of the WDM particle, $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$. A key advancement of our analysis is the integration of a neural network emulator directly at the likelihood level, significantly accelerating Bayesian parameter inference. With new observations of high-redshift ($z$ = 4.2$-$5.0) quasar spectra from UVES and HIRES, we establish stringent upper limits: for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 1 keV, we find $f_{\mathrm{WDM}} &lt; 0.16$ (2$\sigma$), with constraints loosening to 35\%, 50\%, and 67\% for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 2, 3, and 4 keV, respectively. Our results for pure WDM reaffirm the lower bounds of previous work. Crucially, we account for the fixed resolution of simulations and the impact of patchy reionization, demonstrating their minimal influence on mixed dark matter constraints. This robustness paves the way for tighter bounds with improved statistical samples in the future. Our findings suggest that CWDM models can naturally accommodate mild suppression of matter clustering in the high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1D flux power, potentially offering a resolution to some of the ongoing cosmological tensions at low redshifts, namely the $S_{8}$ tension.</description>

      <title>Photonuclear Tomography in Ultraperipheral Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of photonuclear tomography as a novel technique for probing the internal structure of nuclei. In this approach, ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) serve as a source of intense fluxes of virtual photons, which induce coherent production of vector mesons. By analyzing the probabilities and cross sections of these photon-induced processes, we propose a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution of nucleons within the nucleus. Our framework provides a systematic way to access information on the nuclear geometry probed in UPCs, offering new opportunities for studies of nuclear structure using particle production as a probe. Numerical calculations for selected examples illustrate the feasibility and potential of this method.</description>
