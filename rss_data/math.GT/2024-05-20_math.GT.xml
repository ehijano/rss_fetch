      <title>Coloring spheres in 3--manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sphere graph of $M_r$, a connect sum of $r$ copies of $S^1\times S^2$ was introduced by Hatcher as an analog of the curve graph of a surface to study the outer automorphism group of a free group $F_r$. Bestvina, Bromberg, and Fujiwara proved that the chromatic number of the curve graph is finite; bounds were subsequently improved by Gaster, Greene, and Vlamis. Motivated by the analogy, we provide upper and lower bounds for the chromatic number of the sphere graph of $M_r$. As a corollary to the prime decomposition of 3-manifolds, this gives bounds on the chromatic number of the sphere graph for any orientable 3-manifold.</description>

      <title>PL homeomorphisms of surfaces and codimension $2$ PL foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Haefliger-Thurston's conjecture predicts that Haefliger's classifying space for $C^r$-foliations of codimension $n$ whose normal bundles are trivial is $2n$-connected. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture for PL foliations of codimension $2$. As a consequence, we use a version of Mather-Thurston's theorem for PL homeomorphisms due to the author to derive new homological properties for PL surface homeomorphisms. In particular, we answer a question of Epstein in dimension $2$ and prove the simplicity of the identity component of PL surface homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Hurwitz problem with a length-2 partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we provide a new partial solution to the Hurwitz existence problem for surface branched covers. Namely, we consider candidate branch data with base surface the sphere and one partition of the degree having length two, and we fully determine which of them are realizable and which are exceptional. The case where the covering surface is also the sphere was solved somewhat recently by Pakovich, and we deal here with the case of positive genus. We show that the only other exceptional candidate data, besides those of Pakovich (five infinite families and one sporadic case), are a well-known very specific infinite family in degree 4 (indexed by the genus of the candidate covering surface, which can attain any value), five sporadic cases (four in genus 1 and one in genus 2), and another infinite family in genus 1 also already known. Since the degree is a composite number for all these exceptional data, our findings provide more evidence for the prime-degree conjecture. Our argument proceeds by induction on the genus and on the number of branching points, so our results logically depend on those of Pakovich, and we do not employ the technology of constellations on which his proof is based.</description>

      <title>Automatic continuity of Polynomial maps and cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By classical theorems of Steinhaus and Weil, any Haar measurable homomorphism between locally compact groups is continuous. In particular, any Lebesgue-measurable homomorphism $\phi:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is of the form $\phi(x)=ax$ for some $a \in \mathbb{R}$. In this short note, we prove that any Lebesgue measurable function $\phi:\R \to \R$ that vanishes under any $d+1$ "difference operators" is a polynomial of degree at most $d$. More generally, we prove the continuity of any Haar measurable polynomial map between locally compact groups, in the sense of Leibman. We deduce the above result as a direct consequence of a theorem about the automatic continuity of cocycles.</description>
