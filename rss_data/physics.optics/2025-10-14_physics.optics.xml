      <title>Ideal Optical Antimatter using Passive Lossy Materials under Complex Frequency Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original concept of left-handed material has inspired the possibility of optical antimatter, where the effect of light propagation through a medium can be completely cancelled by its complementary medium. Despite recent progress in the development of negative-index metamaterials, losses continue to be a significant barrier to realizing optical antimatter. In this work, we show that passive, lossy materials can be used to realize optical antimatter when illuminated by light at a complex frequency. We further establish that one can engineer arbitrary complex-valued permittivity and permeability in such materials. Strikingly, we show that materials with a positive index at real frequencies can act as negative-index materials under complex frequency excitation. Using our approach, we numerically demonstrate the optical antimatter functionality, as well as double focusing by an ideal perfect lens and superscattering. Our work demonstrates the power of temporally structured light in unlocking the promising opportunities of complementary media, which have until now been inhibited by material loss.</description>

      <title>Interference-induced cavity resonances and imaginary Rabi splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritons are usually described within single-mode cavity QED models. However, nanophotonic environments typically involve several modes that spectrally overlap and interfere, giving rise to sharp dip features such as Fano profiles in the electromagnetic spectral density. Here, we identify these features as interference-induced resonances, effective electromagnetic modes with complex, non-Hermitian couplings to quantum emitters. We show that these modes hybridize with emitters to form polaritons even when the system parameters do not satisfy the single-mode strong-coupling criterion. Moreover, the resulting polaritons differ in their decay rates, a phenomenon we term imaginary Rabi splitting. Extending the analysis to ensembles, we find that coupling to interference-induced resonances produces long-lived polaritons that can outlast excitonic dark states. Numerical simulations of a realistic hybrid metallodielectric platform confirm these predictions and demonstrate their robustness against disorder and loss. Our results reveal a new polaritonic regime beyond the single-mode description, offering new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in complex electromagnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Dipole-quadrupole model and multipole analysis of resonant membrane metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>General model and modulation strategies for Sagnac-based encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, there has been an increasing demand for faster modulation schemes. Electro-optic modulators are essential components in modern photonic systems, enabling high-speed control of light for applications ranging from telecommunications to quantum communication. Conventional inline and Mach-Zehnder modulators, while widely adopted, are limited by bias drift, high operating voltages, and polarization-mode dispersion. Sagnac loop-based modulators have recently emerged as a promising alternative, offering inherent stability against environmental fluctuations and eliminating the need for active bias control. In this work, we present a comprehensive model of the Sagnac modulator that captures both intensity and polarization modulation. We analyze the role of asymmetry in the loop, highlighting its impact on the achievable repetition rate, and propose modulation strategies to overcome these constraints. Finally, we investigate the symmetric Sagnac configuration and demonstrate practical techniques for achieving robust modulation while mitigating experimental challenges. Our results establish the Sagnac modulator as a versatile and stable platform for next-generation photonic and quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>High Throughput Optical Switching in Telecommunication Band via Hybrid Phase Change Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for more efficient data transmission has made nanoscale high-throughput all-optical switching a critical requirement in modern telecommunication systems. Metasurface-based platforms offer unique advantages because of their compact design, energy efficiency, and the ability to precisely manipulate light at the subwavelength scale, in a contact-less fashion. However, achieving both high transmission modulation and low optical loss in the telecom band remains a challenge. This study develops monolithic and hybrid metasurfaces based on the phase change material antimony trisulfide (Sb$_2$S$_3$) to address this limitation. First, we demonstrate the capability of Sb$_2$S$_3$ to offer up to ~91 percent modulation, even with a magnetic dipole - a low-Q resonance. It lifts the requirement for complex precisely fabricated metasurfaces, a long-standing limitation in the community for all optical switching. Furthermore, with the most straightforward hybridisation approach, i.e. depositing a thin film of silicon, we improved the simulated modulation depth to 99 percent. Experimentally, over 80 percent modulation was achieved for both hybrid and monolithic structures, with nearly 2-fold less power required for switching in the hybrid design whilst maintaining high modulation depth. This performance results from the significant refractive index tunability of Sb$_2$S$_3$ and its intrinsically low optical loss (k &lt; 10^{-4}) in the telecom band, further enhanced by silicon integration. The demonstrated metasurfaces offer an effective and scalable approach for all-optical light modulation with strong potential for integration into CMOS-compatible photonic circuits and next-generation telecommunications systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical gating in a nonlinear lithium niobate microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in optical simulation and computational techniques have renewed interest in high-finesse optical cavities for applications such as enhancing light-matter interactions, engineering complex photonic band structures, and storing quantum information. However, the extended interaction times enabled by these cavities often come at the cost of slow optical read-out protocols and limited control over system transients. To address this challenge, we demonstrate an ultrafast intra-cavity optical gating scheme in a high-finesse, second-order nonlinear microcavity incorporating a thin-film of lithium niobate. A femtosecond optical gate pulse -- tuned to the transparency region of the cavity's dielectric mirrors -- achieves instantaneous up-conversion of the intra-cavity field via sum-frequency generation. The resulting upconverted signal exits the cavity as a short pulse, providing space- and time-resolved, on-demand access to the intra-cavity state. We validate this approach by tracking the dynamics of multiple resonant modes excited in a plano-concave distributed Bragg reflector microcavity, showing close agreement with analytical models. Additionally, we demonstrate that stimulated intra-cavity difference-frequency generation can efficiently instantiate cavity modes on femtosecond timescales. This gating scheme is fully compatible with low-temperature microcavity experiments, paving the way for advanced quantum state storage, retrieval, and real-time control of light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap between ultrafast optics and resonant photonics via omni-resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-finesse planar Fabry-P{\'e}rot (FP) cavities spectrally filter the incident field at discrete resonances, and thus cannot be utilized to resonantly enhance the field of ultrashort pulses. Introducing judicious angular dispersion into a pulse can give rise to `omni-resonance', whereby the entire bandwidth of a spatiotemporally structured ultrafast pulse couples to a single longitudinal cavity resonance, even when the pulse bandwidth far exceeds the resonant linewidth. Here we show that omni-resonance increases the intra-cavity peak intensity above that of a pulse having equal energy and bandwidth when tightly focused in free space -- maintained across its entire bandwidth and along a cavity longer than the Rayleigh length of the focused pulse. This paves the way towards broadband resonant enhancement of nonlinear optical effects, thereby bridging the gap between ultrafast optics and resonant photonics.</description>

      <title>Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of bilayer meta-grating with unidirectional guide resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer meta-gratings with asymmetric structural parameters could host unidirectional guide resonances. The distribution of unidirectional guide resonances in the space of structural parameters and synthetic parameters is identified. As the incident optical beam being resonant with the unidirectional guide resonance, the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of the scattered beams exhibit two anomalous behaviors: the resonant peak of the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift is accompanied by constant transmittance and reflectance; the magnitude of the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift is not always proportional to the quality factor of the unidirectional guide resonance. The temporal coupled mode theory analysis reveals that the first anomalous behavior is due to interference between direct scattering and radiation from the unidirectional guide resonance; the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts are proportional to the group velocity as well as the quality factor of the unidirectional guide resonance. Numerical simulations of incidence of Gaussian beam with finite beam width provide intuitive visualization of the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift.</description>

      <title>Recursive Inverse Design Enables Hyper-spectral Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum manipulation is central to photonic systems, where advanced computing and sensing applications often demand highly complex spectral responses to achieve high throughput. Conventional methods for enhancing spectral complexity typically rely on cascading discrete photonic components, resulting in a complexity that scales only linearly with the number of components. Here, we introduce hyper-spectral photonic integrated circuits (HS-PICs), in which spectral complexity scales exponentially with the number of components. This is achieved through recursive inverse design - a system-level inverse design strategy that exploits intricate inter-component interactions as design freedoms, thereby substantially expanding the design space for spectral engineering. Using this approach, we demonstrate that even a single waveguide structure can resolve spectra with sub-picometer resolution, surpassing the performance of current state-of-the-art spectrometers. This performance bridges optical and microwave frequencies in spectral analysis, enabling simultaneous monitoring of optical and radio signals within a single device. Our work establishes a transformative framework for next-generation computing and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Single chip 1 Tb/s optical transmitter with inverse designed input and output couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical interconnects are essential for data centers and AI systems. Given the limited energy production, ultra-low energy and dense optical interconnects are required to support the exponential growth of AI systems. Here we report the demonstration of a monolithically integrated optical transmitter where use of power efficient architecture and devices such as capacitive tuning of optical structures at zero static power consumption and efficient and wideband inverse designed grating couplers enable implementation of a 32-channel transmitter chip based on wavelength-division multiplexing achieving a record modulation energy efficiency of 32 fJ/b at 5 Gb/s/channel and 106 fJ/b at 32 Gb/s/channel, which includes the tuning of optical devices. Furthermore, a bit-error-rate of 1E-12 was achieved, while all channels are simultaneously operating with an aggregate data-rate of 1.024 Tb/s. The system utilizes 16 carrier wavelengths in the optical C band. The pseudo-random-bit-streams are electrically generated on-chip and used to drive individually wavelength-stabilized 2-section p-n-capacitive micro-ring modulators using integrated energy-efficient high-swing electrical drivers. The low-loss inverse designed grating couplers have -1-dB bandwidth of 25 nm. The chip concurrently achieves the highest aggregate data-rate, the highest energy efficiency and the highest bandwidth density for a multi-channel high date-rate optical transmitter chip reported to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal phonons are a major source of decoherence in quantum mechanical systems. Operating in the quantum ground state is therefore often an experimental prerequisite. Additionally to passive cooling in a cryogenic environment, active laser cooling enables the reduction of phonons at specific acoustic frequencies. Brillouin cooling has been used to show efficient reduction of the thermal phonon population in waveguides at GHz frequencies down to 74 K. In this letter, we demonstrate cooling of a 7.608 GHz acoustic mode by combining Brillouin active cooling with precooling from 77 K using liquid nitrogen. We show a 69 % reduction in the phonon population, resulting in a final temperature of 24.3 K, 50 K lower than previously reported.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes characterise the transient response of static optical cavities. Here, we introduce the notion of a Floquet quasinormal mode to describe transient responses in photonic time crystals. Contrasting their static counterparts, exceptional points associated with symmetry transitions are an inherent feature, as modes spontaneously and non-perturbatively lock their phase to the oscillations of the material. We further investigate the limiting behaviour of the Floquet quasinormal modes in large cavities. Distinct non-perturbative behaviour arises in time-modulated systems as increasingly large time-crystal cavities come closer to achieving the maximum gain predicted from a bulk wavenumber bandgap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although solids have been recently used in ultrafast experiments for spectral broadening due to their relatively high nonlinearity, their sensitivity to damage limits their long-term stability. Liquids are a possible alternative to solids as a nonlinear medium because of their comparable nonlinearity and resistance to permanent damage. We generate a supercontinuum in 1-decanol that spans more than an octave from the visible to the near-infrared regime. We measure the nonlinear index of refraction of 1-decanol and find a significant $n_4$ contribution. This contribution leads to a nonlinearity comparable to CS$_2$ (a frequent reference for nonlinear optics) in high-intensity regimes while being significantly less volatile and toxic. We find this supercontinuum spectrum to be stable for at least 30 minutes.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Coding for Accommodation-Invariant Near-Eye Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new computational near-eye display method that addresses the vergence-accommodation conflict problem in stereoscopic displays through accommodation-invariance. Our system integrates a refractive lens eyepiece with a novel wavefront coding diffractive optical element, operating in tandem with a pre-processing convolutional neural network. We employ end-to-end learning to jointly optimize the wavefront-coding optics and the image pre-processing module. To implement this approach, we develop a differentiable retinal image formation model that accounts for limiting aperture and chromatic aberrations introduced by the eye optics. We further integrate the neural transfer function and the contrast sensitivity function into the loss model to account for related perceptual effects. To tackle off-axis distortions, we incorporate position dependency into the pre-processing module. In addition to conducting rigorous analysis based on simulations, we also fabricate the designed diffractive optical element and build a benchtop setup, demonstrating accommodation-invariance for depth ranges of up to four diopters.</description>

      <title>First GNSS-deployed optical clock for local time scale upgrade</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise time scale is the universal base for all measurements. Here we report the deployment of a compact and transportable optical clock to a timekeeping institution and steering an active hydrogen maser to generate an optical time scale, realizing the upgrade of the local time scale in the Global Navigation Satellite System. The optical clock was transported over 1200 km by express delivery and resume work as normal promptly, and its extremely high uptime of 93.6% in the half-year enabled us to precisely correct the frequency drift of hydrogen maser, ultimately achieving an unprecedented monthly instability of 4E-17. This steering experiment with a deployable optical clock marks a significant advancement, demonstrating that a timing accuracy below 100 ps per month can be achieved feasibly in various timekeeping institutions where hydrogen masers are typically employed as the primary contributor to timekeeping. In the future, mobile optical time scale based on such transportable optical clock can be deployed flexibly and rapidly, which is particularly important in scenarios lacking International Atomic Time reference.</description>

      <title>Green's function expansion for multiple coupled optical resonators with finite retardation using quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic Green's function is a crucial ingredient for the theoretical study of modern photonic quantum devices, but is often difficult or even impossible to calculate directly. We present a numerically efficient framework for calculating the scattered electromagnetic Green's function of a multi-cavity system with spatially separated open cavities (with arbitrary shape, dispersion and loss) and finite retardation times. The framework is based on a Dyson scattering equation that enables the construction of the Green's function from the quasinormal modes of the individual resonators within a few-mode approximation and a finite number of iteration steps without requiring nested integrals. The approach shows excellent agreement with the full numerical Green's function for the example of two coupled dipoles located in the gaps of two metal dimers serving as quasinormal mode cavities, and is easily extended to arbitrarily large separations and multiple cavities.</description>

      <title>OmniLens: Towards Universal Lens Aberration Correction via LensLib-to-Specific Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging universal Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) paradigms provide an inspiring solution to light-weight and high-quality imaging with a universal model trained on a lens library (LensLib) to address arbitrary lens aberrations blindly. However, the limited coverage of existing LensLibs leads to poor generalization of the trained models to unseen lenses, whose fine-tuning pipeline is also confined to the lens-descriptions-known case. In this work, we introduce OmniLens, a flexible solution to universal CAC via (i) establishing a convincing LensLib with comprehensive coverage for pre-training a robust base model, and (ii) adapting the model to any specific lens designs with unknown lens descriptions via fast LensLib-to-specific domain adaptation. To achieve these, an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline is proposed to generate a rich variety of lens samples with realistic aberration behaviors. Then, we design an unsupervised regularization term for efficient domain adaptation on a few easily accessible real-captured images based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in degradation induced by lens aberrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LensLib generated by EAOD effectively develops a universal CAC model with strong generalization capabilities, which can also improve the non-blind lens-specific methods by 0.35-1.81dB in PSNR. Additionally, the proposed domain adaptation method significantly improves the base model, especially in severe aberration cases (at most 2.59dB in PSNR). The code and data will be available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens.</description>

      <title>On quantifying the spin angular momentum density of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In addition to energy, light carries linear and angular momentum. These are key quantities in rapidly developing optics research and in technologies focusing on light induced forces and torques on materials. Spin angular momentum (SAM) density is of particular interest, since unlike orbital angular momentum, it is uncoupled from linear momentum. The SAM density of light was first estimated in 1909 by Poynting, using a mechanical analogy. Exact expressions, based on results from quantum mechanics and field theory were subsequently developed, and are in common use today. In this paper, we show that the SAM density of light can be obtained directly from the Coulomb force and Maxwell's equations, without reliance on quantum mechanics or field theories; it could have been calculated by Maxwell and his contemporaries. Besides its historical significance, the simple derivation of our result makes it readily accessible to non-experts in the field.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of a SU(3) color-orbit coupling in an ultracold gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction couples the spin of a particle to its motion and leads to spin-induced transport phenomena such as spin-Hall effects and Chern insulators. In this work, we extend the concept of internal-external state coupling to higher internal symmetry, exploring features beyond the established spin-orbit regime. We couple suitable resonant laser beams to a gas of ultracold atoms, thereby inducing artificial SU(3) non-Abelian gauge fields that act on a degenerate ground state manifold comprised of three dark states. We demonstrate the inherent all-state connectivity of SU(3) systems by performing targeted geometric transformations. Then, we investigate color-orbit coupling, an extension of SU(2) spin-orbit coupling to SU(3) systems. We reveal a rich dynamical interplay between three distinct oscillation frequencies, which possesses interesting analogies with neutrino oscillations and quark mixing mechanisms. In the future, the system should provide a testbed for exploring topological properties of SU(3) systems.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18312v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This approach to probing ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast switching of telecom photon-number states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crucial component of photonic quantum information processing platforms is the ability to modulate, route, convert, and switch quantum states of light noiselessly with low insertion loss. For instance, a high-speed, low-loss optical switch is crucial for scaling quantum photonic systems that rely on measurement-based feed-forward approaches. Such a device will also ideally be capable of operating on photon-number states, which can act as non-Gaussian resources. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast all-optical switching of heralded photon-number states, of up to 6 photons, using the optical Kerr effect in a single-mode fiber. A local birefringence is created by a high-intensity pump pulse at a center wavelength of 1030 nm which overlaps temporally with the 1550 nm photons in the fiber. A switching efficiency of $&gt;$99 % is reached with a resolution of 2.3 ps, an insertion loss of $2.27\pm0.08$ dB, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 32,000.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design in Nanophotonics via Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.</description>
