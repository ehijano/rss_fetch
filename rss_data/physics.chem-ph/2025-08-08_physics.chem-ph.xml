      <title>Best practices for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations aim to describe the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics of molecules in excited electronic states. These simulations have been applied to understand a plethora of photochemical and photophysical processes, and, as a result, the number of nonadiabatic dynamics simulations has been growing significantly over the past decade. Yet, the field remains in its infancy, and a potential user may find it difficult to approach this type of simulation, given their complexity and the number of elements that should be considered for a (hopefully) successful nonadiabatic dynamics simulation. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics relies on several key steps: finding a level of electronic-structure theory to describe the molecule in its Franck-Condon region and beyond, describing the photoexcitation process, selecting a method to perform the nonadiabatic dynamics, and analyzing the final results before calculating observables for a more direct comparison with experiment. This Best Practices aims to provide a general guide for the user of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics by (i) discussing the fundamentals of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and the various trajectory-based methods developed for molecular systems, (ii) introducing the different electronic-structure methods and concepts - adiabatic/diabatic representation, conical intersections - that can be used with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (or for benchmarking), (iii) providing details on the various steps required to perform a nonadiabatic dynamics simulation and their practical use, as well as guided examples and a discussion on the calculation of observables, (iv) proposing a FAQ with the typical questions a user may have when performing nonadiabatic dynamics, and (v) sketching a checklist for the key practical steps when performing a (trajectory-based) nonadiabatic molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Anisotropic Interface Continuum Solvation Model and the Finite-Element Anisotropic Poisson Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an anisotropic interfacial continuum solvation (AICS) model to simulate the distinct in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric constants of liquids near solid-liquid interfaces and their spatial variations along the surface normal direction. In low-electron-density regions, each dielectric function in the diagonal components of a dielectric tensor varies monotonically with distance from the solid surface along the surface normal; in high-electron-density regions near the surface, each dielectric function adopts the electron-density-based formulation proposed by Andreussi et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 136, 064102 (2012)) The resulting dielectric tensor is continuously differentiable with respect to both electron density and spatial coordinates. We derived analytical expressions for electrostatic contributions to the KS potential and forces, and implemented AICS, including these analytical derivatives, into CP2K. To solve the anisotropic Poisson equations, we developed a parallel finite-element anisotropic Poisson solver (FEAPS) based on the FEniCSx platform and its interface with CP2K. Analytical forces were validated against finite-difference calculations, while electrostatic potentials computed under vacuum and isotropic solvent conditions using AICS and FEAPS were benchmarked against standard vacuum DFT and SCCS results, respectively. In the anisotropic solvent environment characterized by the enhanced in-plane and reduced out-of-plane dielectric functions near the Ag(111) surface, we calculated the resulting work functions and electrostatic potentials, and optimized the adsorption geometry for OH. Compared to the isotropic case, we observed more pronounced work function shifts and spatially modulated electrostatic profiles across different charge states. Our results also showed that OH tilted more towards the plane parallel to the surface under the anisotropic dielectric conditions.</description>

      <title>The Mpemba Effect in Pure Water Has a Stochastic Origin. Experimental and Theoretical Resolution of the Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Mpemba effect" is the name given to the assertion that hot water freezes quicker than cold water1 or, in a modern and more general form, that the system that is initially more distant from its equilibrium state comes to this state earlier2. This counterintuitive statement seems to breach fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic laws; however, numerous experiments3-10 with classical and quantum systems demonstrate this paradoxical Mpemba effect, leading to extensive discssions in prominent scientific jornals2,5,9,12-14. However, the fundamental physical mechanisms behind this effect have remained elusive14. Here we performed the water freezing experiments under carefully controlled conditions, and found that the Mpemba effect only occurred when the freezer temperature was very close to the temperature of ice nucleation. In this case, the range of freezing times for both hot and cold water was so great that it exceeded the delayed cooling of the initially hotter liquid, and therefore sometimes the hot water froze before the cold water. Our theoretical analysis of this fact shows that the Mpemba paradox associated with water freezing is rooted in the stochastic nature of ice nucleation, typical of first-order phase transitions. We anticipate our assay to be a starting point for reconsidering the famous Mpemba paradox in water and other systems undergoing similar phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>The use of open boundaries in stochastic hydrodynamic models of nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic hydrodynamics is a central tool in the study of first order phase transitions at a fundamental level. Combined with sophisticated free energy models, e.g. as developed in classical Density Functional Theory, complex processes such as crystallization can be modeled and information such as free energy barriers, nucleation pathways and the unstable eigenvector and eigenvalues determined. The latter are particularly interesting as they play key roles in defining the natural (unbiased) order parameter and the nucleation rate respectively. As is often the case, computational realities restrict the size of system that can be modeled and this makes it difficult to achieve experimental conditions for which the volume is effectively infinite. In this paper, the use of open boundary conditions is discussed. By using an open system, the calculations become much closer to experimental conditions however, the introduction of open boundary conditions raises a number of questions concerning the stochastic model such as whether the fluctuation-dissipation relation is preserved and whether stationary points on the free energy surface remain stationary points of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Simplification of the Fermi-L\"owdin Self-Interaction Correction Method for Efficient Self-Interaction-Free Density Functional Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermi-L\"owdin orbital self-interaction-correction (FLOSIC) method uses symmetric orthogonalized Fermi orbitals as localized orbitals in one-electron SIC schemes. In FLOSIC, a set of Fermi orbital descriptors (FOD) that define the FLOs is obtained by energy minimization. Determination of optimal FODs is a computationally very demanding task. Here, we propose to simplify the FLOSIC calculations by removing self-interaction error (SIE) from a set of selected orbitals of interest (SOSIC). We illustrate the approach by choosing a set of valence orbitals as active orbitals in SOSIC. The results of a wide range of properties obtained using the valence SOSIC (vSOSIC) scheme are compared with those obtained with the Perdew-Zunger SIC. The two methods agree within a few percent for the majority of the properties. The mean absolute error in the vertical detachment energy of water cluster anions with vSOSIC-PBE against benchmark CCSD(T) results is only 15 meV making vSOSIC-PBE an excellent alternative to the CCSD(T) for the case. The calculation on the [Cu$_2$Cl$_6$]$^{2-}$ complex demonstrates that the FOD optimization in vSOSIC is substantially smoother and faster. Assessment of the performance of SIC-r$^2$SCAN shows that it performs similarly to the SIC-SCAN for most properties, but for atomization energies, SIC-r$^2$SCAN outperforms SIC-SCAN.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent GW via conservation of spectral moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand on a recently introduced alternate framework for $GW$ simulation of charged excitations [Scott et. al., J. Chem. Phys., 158, 124102 (2023)], based around the conservation of directly computed spectral moments of the GW self-energy. Featuring a number of desirable formal properties over other implementations, we also detail efficiency improvements and a parallelism strategy, resulting in an implementation with a demonstrable similar scaling to an established Hartree--Fock code, with only an order of magnitude increase in cost. We also detail the applicability of a range of self-consistent $GW$ variants within this framework, including a scheme for full self-consistency of all dynamical variables, whilst avoiding the Matsubara axis or analytic continuation, allowing formal convergence at zero temperature. By investigating a range of self-consistency protocols over the GW100 molecular test set, we find that a little-explored self-consistent variant based around a simpler coupled chemical potential and Fock matrix optimization to be the most accurate self-consistent $GW$ approach. Additionally, we validate recently observed evidence that Tamm--Dancoff based screening approximations within $GW$ lead to higher accuracy than traditional random phase approximation screening over these molecular test cases. Finally, we consider the Chlorophyll A molecule, finding agreement with experiment within the experimental uncertainty, and a description of the full-frequency spectrum of charged excitations.</description>

      <title>MOFClassifier: A Machine Learning Approach for Validating Computation-Ready Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational discovery and design of new crystalline materials, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), heavily relies on high-quality, computation-ready structural data. However, recent studies have revealed significant error rates within existing MOF databases, posing a critical data problem that hinders efficient high-throughput computational screening. While rule-based algorithms like MOSAEC, MOFChecker, and the Chen and Manz method (Chen-Manz) have been developed to address this, they often suffer from inherent limitations and misclassification of structures. To overcome this challenge, we developed MOFClassifier, a novel machine learning approach built upon a positive-unlabeled crystal graph convolutional neural network (PU-CGCNN) model. MOFClassifier learns intricate patterns from perfect crystal structures to predict a crystal-likeness score (CLscore), effectively classifying MOFs as computation-ready. Our model achieves a ROC value of 0.979 (previous best 0.912) and, importantly, can identify subtle structural and chemical errors that are undetectable by current rule-based methods. By accurately recovering previously misclassified false-negative structures, MOFClassifier reduces the risk of overlooking promising material candidates in large-scale computational screening campaigns. This user-friendly tool is freely available and has been integrated into the prepara-tion workflow for the updated CoRE MOF DB 2025 v1.0, contributing to accelerated computational discovery of MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Enantioselective radical reactions can be induced by electron spin polarization: A quantum mechanism for Nature's emergent homochirality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecules that constitute life on Earth are chiral, but the precise mechanism by which homochirality emerged remains a mystery. In this work it is demonstrated that reactions of radical pairs, where one of the radical electron spins is polarised, can be enantioselective. This phenomenon arises from transient coherent quantum dynamics of the radical pair electron spins, which is known to occur even in warm and noisy condensed phase environments, where energetic perturbations much smaller than thermal energy can have large effects on reactivity. A quantitative theory is presented based on the molecular theory of chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS), where electron exchange interactions and chirality-dependent spin-orbit coupling effects control enantioselectivity. This theory provides useful bounds on the maximum enantiomeric excess for these reactions, which are found to be consistent with previous experiments. The enantioseletive radical pair mechanism presented here provides an alternative mechanistic basis to a recent proposal that spin-polarised photoelectrons from magnetite provided the initial chiral symmetry breaking necessary for the inception of homochirality in Nature, as well as suggests a new strategy for asymmetric synthesis using spin-polarised electrons.</description>

      <title>Leveraging commuting groups for an efficient variational Hamiltonian ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently calculating the low-lying eigenvalues of Hamiltonians, written as sums of Pauli operators, is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. While various methods have been proposed to reduce the complexity of quantum circuits for this task, there remains room for further improvement. In this article, we introduce a new circuit design using commuting groups within the Hamiltonian to further reduce the circuit complexity of Hamiltonian-based quantum circuits. Our approach involves partitioning the Pauli operators into mutually commuting clusters and finding Clifford unitaries that diagonalize each cluster. We then design an ansatz that uses these Clifford unitaries for efficient switching between the clusters, complemented by a layer of parameterized single qubit rotations for each individual cluster. By conducting numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in accurately determining the ground state energy of different quantum chemistry Hamiltonians. Our results highlight the applicability and potential of our approach for designing problem-inspired ansatz for various quantum computing applications.</description>
