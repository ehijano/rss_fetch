      <title>Attacking Autonomous Driving Agents with Adversarial Machine Learning: A Holistic Evaluation with the CARLA Leaderboard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To autonomously control vehicles, driving agents use outputs from a combination of machine-learning (ML) models, controller logic, and custom modules. Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.
  To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.
  We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.</description>

      <title>On-Premise SLMs vs. Commercial LLMs: Prompt Engineering and Incident Classification in SOCs and CSIRTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we evaluate open-source models for security incident classification, comparing them with proprietary models. We utilize a dataset of anonymized real incidents, categorized according to the NIST SP 800-61r3 taxonomy and processed using five prompt-engineering techniques (PHP, SHP, HTP, PRP, and ZSL). The results indicate that, although proprietary models still exhibit higher accuracy, locally deployed open-source models provide advantages in privacy, cost-effectiveness, and data sovereignty.</description>

      <title>CIMemories: A Compositional Benchmark for Contextual Integrity of Persistent Memory in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly use persistent memory from past interactions to enhance personalization and task performance. However, this memory introduces critical risks when sensitive information is revealed in inappropriate contexts. We present CIMemories, a benchmark for evaluating whether LLMs appropriately control information flow from memory based on task context. CIMemories uses synthetic user profiles with over 100 attributes per user, paired with diverse task contexts in which each attribute may be essential for some tasks but inappropriate for others. Our evaluation reveals that frontier models exhibit up to 69% attribute-level violations (leaking information inappropriately), with lower violation rates often coming at the cost of task utility. Violations accumulate across both tasks and runs: as usage increases from 1 to 40 tasks, GPT-5's violations rise from 0.1% to 9.6%, reaching 25.1% when the same prompt is executed 5 times, revealing arbitrary and unstable behavior in which models leak different attributes for identical prompts. Privacy-conscious prompting does not solve this - models overgeneralize, sharing everything or nothing rather than making nuanced, context-dependent decisions. These findings reveal fundamental limitations that require contextually aware reasoning capabilities, not just better prompting or scaling.</description>

      <title>LFreeDA: Label-Free Drift Adaptation for Windows Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based malware detectors degrade over time as concept drift introduces new and evolving families unseen during training. Retraining is limited by the cost and time of manual labeling or sandbox analysis. Existing approaches mitigate this via drift detection and selective labeling, but fully label-free adaptation remains largely unexplored. Recent self-training methods use a previously trained model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and then train a new model on these labels. The unlabeled data are used only for inference and do not participate in training the earlier model. We argue that these unlabeled samples still carry valuable information that can be leveraged when incorporated appropriately into training. This paper introduces LFreeDA, an end-to-end framework that adapts malware classifiers to drift without manual labeling or drift detection. LFreeDA first performs unsupervised domain adaptation on malware images, jointly training on labeled and unlabeled samples to infer pseudo-labels and prune noisy ones. It then adapts a classifier on CFG representations using the labeled and selected pseudo-labeled data, leveraging the scalability of images for pseudo-labeling and the richer semantics of CFGs for final adaptation. Evaluations on the real-world MB-24+ dataset show that LFreeDA improves accuracy by up to 12.6% and F1 by 11.1% over no-adaptation lower bounds, and is only 4% and 3.4% below fully supervised upper bounds in accuracy and F1, respectively. It also matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods provided with ground truth labels for 300 target samples. Additional results on two controlled-drift benchmarks further confirm that LFreeDA maintains malware detection performance as malware evolves without human labeling.</description>

      <title>Critical Evaluation of Quantum Machine Learning for Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computational principles into learning algorithms, offering improved representational capacity and computational efficiency. Nevertheless, the security and robustness of QML systems remain underexplored, especially under adversarial conditions. In this paper, we present a systematization of adversarial robustness in QML, integrating conceptual organization with empirical evaluation across three threat models-black-box, gray-box, and white-box. We implement representative attacks in each category, including label-flipping for black-box, QUID encoder-level data poisoning for gray-box, and FGSM and PGD for white-box, using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) trained on two datasets from distinct domains: MNIST from computer vision and AZ-Class from Android malware, across multiple circuit depths (2, 5, 10, and 50 layers) and two encoding schemes (angle and amplitude). Our evaluation shows that amplitude encoding yields the highest clean accuracy (93% on MNIST and 67% on AZ-Class) in deep, noiseless circuits; however, it degrades sharply under adversarial perturbations and depolarization noise (p=0.01), dropping accuracy below 5%. In contrast, angle encoding, while offering lower representational capacity, remains more stable in shallow, noisy regimes, revealing a trade-off between capacity and robustness. Moreover, the QUID attack attains higher attack success rates, though quantum noise channels disrupt the Hilbert-space correlations it exploits, weakening its impact in image domains. This suggests that noise can act as a natural defense mechanism in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. Overall, our findings guide the development of secure and resilient QML architectures for practical deployment. These insights underscore the importance of designing threat-aware models that remain reliable under real-world noise in NISQ settings.</description>

      <title>GeoShield: Byzantine Fault Detection and Recovery for Geo-Distributed Real-Time Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as railway control systems and smart grids, consist of geographically distributed subsystems that are connected via unreliable, asynchronous inter-region networks. Their scale and distribution make them especially vulnerable to faults and attacks. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerant methods either consume excessive resources or provide only eventual guarantees, making them unsuitable for real-time resource-constrained CPS.
  We present GeoShield, a resource-efficient solution for defending geo-distributed CPS against Byzantine faults. GeoShield leverages the property that CPS are designed to tolerate brief disruptions and maintain safety, as long as they recover (i.e., resume normal operations or transition to a safe mode) within a bounded amount of time following a fault. Instead of masking faults, it detects them and recovers the system within bounded time, thus guaranteeing safety with much fewer resources. GeoShield introduces protocols for Byzantine fault-resilient network measurement and inter-region omission fault detection that proactively detect malicious message delays, along with recovery mechanisms that guarantee timely recovery while maximizing operational robustness. It is the first bounded-time recovery solution that operates effectively under unreliable networks without relying on trusted hardware. Evaluations using real-world case studies show that it significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Classifying Benign And Malicious Packages Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the number of malicious open-source packages in package repositories has been increasing dramatically. While major security scanners focus on identifying known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in open-source packages, there are very few studies on detecting malicious packages. Malicious open-source package detection typically requires static, dynamic analysis, or both. Dynamic analysis is more effective as it can expose a package's behaviors at runtime. However, current dynamic analysis tools (e.g., ossf's package-analysis) lack an automatic method to differentiate malicious packages from benign packages. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract the features from dynamic analysis (e.g., executed commands) and leverage machine learning techniques to automatically classify packages as benign or malicious. Our evaluation of nearly 2000 packages on npm shows that the machine learning classifier achieves an AUC of 0.91 with a false positive rate of nearly 0%.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Zero-Knowledge Proof for PSPACE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been restricted to NP statements so far, whereas they exist for all statements in PSPACE. This work presents the first practical zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols for PSPACE-complete statements by enabling ZK proofs of QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula) evaluation. The core idea is to validate quantified resolution proofs (Q-Res) in ZK. We develop an efficient polynomial encoding of Q-Res proofs, enabling proof validation through low-overhead arithmetic checks. We also design a ZK protocol to prove knowledge of a winning strategy related to the QBF, which is often equally important in practice. We implement our protocols and evaluate them on QBFEVAL. The results show that our protocols can verify 72% of QBF evaluations via Q-Res proof and 82% of instances' winning strategies within 100 seconds, for instances where such proofs or strategies can be obtained.</description>

      <title>MAIF: Enforcing AI Trust and Provenance with an Artifact-Centric Agentic Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI trustworthiness crisis threatens to derail the artificial intelligence revolution, with regulatory barriers, security vulnerabilities, and accountability gaps preventing deployment in critical domains. Current AI systems operate on opaque data structures that lack the audit trails, provenance tracking, or explainability required by emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. We propose an artifact-centric AI agent paradigm where behavior is driven by persistent, verifiable data artifacts rather than ephemeral tasks, solving the trustworthiness problem at the data architecture level. Central to this approach is the Multimodal Artifact File Format (MAIF), an AI-native container embedding semantic representations, cryptographic provenance, and granular access controls. MAIF transforms data from passive storage into active trust enforcement, making every AI operation inherently auditable. Our production-ready implementation demonstrates ultra-high-speed streaming (2,720.7 MB/s), optimized video processing (1,342 MB/s), and enterprise-grade security. Novel algorithms for cross-modal attention, semantic compression, and cryptographic binding achieve up to 225 compression while maintaining semantic fidelity. Advanced security features include stream-level access control, real-time tamper detection, and behavioral anomaly analysis with minimal overhead. This approach directly addresses the regulatory, security, and accountability challenges preventing AI deployment in sensitive domains, offering a viable path toward trustworthy AI systems at scale.</description>

      <title>Can MLLMs Detect Phishing? A Comprehensive Security Benchmark Suite Focusing on Dynamic Threats and Multimodal Evaluation in Academic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has introduced unprecedented security challenges, particularly in phishing detection within academic environments. Academic institutions and researchers are high-value targets, facing dynamic, multilingual, and context-dependent threats that leverage research backgrounds, academic collaborations, and personal information to craft highly tailored attacks. Existing security benchmarks largely rely on datasets that do not incorporate specific academic background information, making them inadequate for capturing the evolving attack patterns and human-centric vulnerability factors specific to academia. To address this gap, we present AdapT-Bench, a unified methodological framework and benchmark suite for systematically evaluating MLLM defense capabilities against dynamic phishing attacks in academic settings.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy, Evaluation and Exploitation of IPI-Centric LLM Agent Defense Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with function-calling capabilities are increasingly deployed, but remain vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks that hijack their tool calls. In response, numerous IPI-centric defense frameworks have emerged. However, these defenses are fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present the first comprehensive analysis of IPI-centric defense frameworks. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of these defenses, classifying them along five dimensions. We then thoroughly assess the security and usability of representative defense frameworks. Through analysis of defensive failures in the assessment, we identify six root causes of defense circumvention. Based on these findings, we design three novel adaptive attacks that significantly improve attack success rates targeting specific frameworks, demonstrating the severity of the flaws in these defenses. Our paper provides a foundation and critical insights for the future development of more secure and usable IPI-centric agent defense frameworks.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy GenAI over 6G: Integrated Applications and Security Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into 6G networks promises substantial performance gains while simultaneously exposing novel security vulnerabilities rooted in multimodal data processing and autonomous reasoning. This article presents a unified perspective on cross-domain vulnerabilities that arise across integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), federated learning (FL), digital twins (DTs), diffusion models (DMs), and large telecommunication models (LTMs). We highlight emerging adversarial agents such as compromised DTs and LTMs that can manipulate both the physical and cognitive layers of 6G systems. To address these risks, we propose an adaptive evolutionary defense (AED) concept that continuously co-evolves with attacks through GenAI-driven simulation and feedback, combining physical-layer protection, secure learning pipelines, and cognitive-layer resilience. A case study using an LLM-based port prediction model for fluid-antenna systems demonstrates the susceptibility of GenAI modules to adversarial perturbations and the effectiveness of the proposed defense concept. Finally, we summarize open challenges and future research directions toward building trustworthy, quantum-resilient, and adaptive GenAI-enabled 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving IoT in Connected Aircraft Cabin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices in shared, multi-vendor environments like the modern aircraft cabin creates a fundamental conflict between the promise of data collaboration and the risks to passenger privacy, vendor intellectual property (IP), and regulatory compliance. While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.</description>

      <title>Small Language Models for Phishing Website Detection: Cost, Performance, and Privacy Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing websites pose a major cybersecurity threat, exploiting unsuspecting users and causing significant financial and organisational harm. Traditional machine learning approaches for phishing detection often require extensive feature engineering, continuous retraining, and costly infrastructure maintenance. At the same time, proprietary large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in phishing-related classification tasks, but their operational costs and reliance on external providers limit their practical adoption in many business environments. This paper investigates the feasibility of small language models (SLMs) for detecting phishing websites using only their raw HTML code. A key advantage of these models is that they can be deployed on local infrastructure, providing organisations with greater control over data and operations. We systematically evaluate 15 commonly used Small Language Models (SLMs), ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, benchmarking their classification accuracy, computational requirements, and cost-efficiency. Our results highlight the trade-offs between detection performance and resource consumption, demonstrating that while SLMs underperform compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs, they can still provide a viable and scalable alternative to external LLM services. By presenting a comparative analysis of costs and benefits, this work lays the foundation for future research on the adaptation, fine-tuning, and deployment of SLMs in phishing detection systems, aiming to balance security effectiveness and economic practicality.</description>

      <title>How To Cook The Fragmented Rug Pull?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing rug pull detectors assume a simple workflow: the deployer keeps liquidity pool (LP) tokens and performs one or a few large sells (within a day) that collapse the pool and cash out. In practice, however, many real-world exits violate these assumptions by splitting the attack across both time and actor dimensions: attackers break total extraction into many low-impact trades and route proceeds through multiple non-owner addresses, producing low-visibility drains.
  We formalize this family of attacks as the fragmented rug pull (FRP) and offer a compact recipe for a slow-stewed beef special: (i) keep the lid on (to preserve LP control so on-chain extraction remains feasible), (ii) chop thin slices (to split the total exit volume into many low-impact micro-trades that individually fall below impact thresholds), and (iii) pass the ladle (to delegate sells across multiple wallets so that each participant takes a small share of the extraction). Technically, we define three atomic predicate groups and show that their orthogonal combinations yield evasive strategies overlooked by prior heuristics (USENIX Sec 19, USENIX Sec 23).
  We validate the model with large-scale measurements. Our corpus contains 303,614 LPs, among which 105,434 are labeled as FRP pools. The labeled subset includes 34,192,767 pool-related transactions and 401,838 inflated-seller wallets, involving 1,501,408 unique interacting addresses. Notably, owner-wallet participation in inflated selling among FRP-flagged LPs has declined substantially (33.1% of cases), indicating a shift in scam behavior: the liquidity drain is no longer held on the owner wallet. We also detected 127,252 wallets acting as serial scammers when repeatedly engaging in inflated selling across multiple FRP LPs. Our empirical findings demonstrate that the evasive strategies we define are widespread and operationally significant.</description>

      <title>Towards a Formal Verification of Secure Vehicle Software Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where software governs most vehicle functions alongside enhanced connectivity, the need for secure software updates has become increasingly critical. Software vulnerabilities can severely impact safety, the economy, and society. In response to this challenge, Strandberg et al. [escar Europe, 2021] introduced the Unified Software Update Framework (UniSUF), designed to provide a secure update framework that integrates seamlessly with existing vehicular infrastructures.
  Although UniSUF has previously been evaluated regarding cybersecurity, these assessments have not employed formal verification methods. To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework.</description>

      <title>Beluga: Block Synchronization for BFT Consensus Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern high-throughput BFT consensus protocols use streamlined push-pull mechanisms to disseminate blocks and keep happy-path performance optimal. Yet state-of-the-art designs lack a principled and efficient way to exchange blocks, which leaves them open to targeted attacks and performance collapse under network asynchrony. This work introduces the concept of a block synchronizer, a simple abstraction that drives incremental block retrieval and enforces resource-aware exchange. Its interface and role fit cleanly inside a modern BFT consensus stack. We also uncover a new attack, where an adversary steers honest validators into redundant, uncoordinated pulls that exhaust bandwidth and stall progress. Beluga is a modular and scarcity-aware instantiation of the block synchronizer. It achieves optimal common-case latency while bounding the cost of recovery under faults and adversarial behavior. We integrate Beluga into Mysticeti, the consensus core of the Sui blockchain, and show on a geo-distributed AWS deployment that Beluga sustains optimal performance in the optimistic path and, under attack, delivers up to 3x higher throughput and 25x lower latency than prior designs. The Sui blockchain adopted Beluga in production.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Bounds in the Shuffle Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shuffle model enhances privacy by anonymizing users' reports through random permutation. This paper presents the first systematic study of the single-message shuffle model from an information-theoretic perspective. We analyze two regimes: the shuffle-only setting, where each user directly submits its message ($Y_i=X_i$), and the shuffle-DP setting, where each user first applies a local $\varepsilon_0$-differentially private mechanism before shuffling ($Y_i=\mathcal{R}(X_i)$). Let $\boldsymbol{Z} = (Y_{\sigma(i)})_i$ denote the shuffled sequence produced by a uniformly random permutation $\sigma$, and let $K = \sigma^{-1}(1)$ represent the position of user 1's message after shuffling.
  For the shuffle-only setting, we focus on a tractable yet expressive \emph{basic configuration}, where the target user's message follows $Y_1 \sim P$ and the remaining users' messages are i.i.d.\ samples from $Q$, i.e., $Y_2,\dots,Y_n \sim Q$. We derive asymptotic expressions for the mutual information quantities $I(Y_1;\boldsymbol{Z})$ and $I(K;\boldsymbol{Z})$ as $n \to \infty$, and demonstrate how this analytical framework naturally extends to settings with heterogeneous user distributions.
  For the shuffle-DP setting, we establish information-theoretic upper bounds on total information leakage. When each user applies an $\varepsilon_0$-DP mechanism, the overall leakage satisfies $I(K; \boldsymbol{Z}) \le 2\varepsilon_0$ and $I(X_1; \boldsymbol{Z}\mid (X_i)_{i=2}^n) \le (e^{\varepsilon_0}-1)/(2n) + O(n^{-3/2})$. These results bridge shuffle differential privacy and mutual-information-based privacy.</description>

      <title>QADR: A Scalable, Quantum-Resistant Protocol for Anonymous Data Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The security of future large-scale IoT networks is critically threatened by the ``Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' (HNDL) attack paradigm. Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems.</description>

      <title>BlueBottle: Fast and Robust Blockchains through Subsystem Specialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain consensus faces a trilemma of security, latency, and decentralization. High-throughput systems often require a reduction in decentralization or robustness against strong adversaries, while highly decentralized and secure systems tend to have lower performance. We present BlueBottle, a two-layer consensus architecture. The core layer, BB-Core, is an n=5f+1 protocol that trades some fault tolerance for a much lower finality latency with a medium-sized core validator set. Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f&lt;3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations). Together, these layers enable optimistic sub-second finality at high throughput while maintaining strong safety and liveness under a mild synchrony assumption.</description>

      <title>When Can You Trust Bitcoin? Value-Dependent Block Confirmation to Determine Transaction Finalit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study financial transaction confirmation finality in Bitcoin as a function of transaction amount and user risk tolerance. A transaction is recorded in a block on a blockchain. However, a transaction may be revoked due to a fork in the blockchain, the odds of which decrease over time but never reach zero. Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance.</description>

      <title>Overview of Routing Approaches in Quantum Key Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks enable unconditionally secure key exchange using quantum mechanical principles. However, routing cryptographic keys across multi-hop quantum networks introduces challenges unique to quantum communication. This survey analyzes and classifies 26 routing strategies proposed between 2013 and 2024 for terrestrial, satellite, and hybrid QKD infrastructures. Dynamic, key-aware routing algorithms have been shown to reduce service rejection rates by 25-40% compared to static shortest-path methods by incorporating real-time key pool availability and link error rates. Multi-path strategies improve resilience against trusted-node compromise by distributing keys across disjoint routes, albeit with an increase in key consumption of 30-60%. SDN-based orchestration frameworks emerge as essential enablers of flexible, QoS-aware routing for hybrid networks integrating terrestrial fibers and intermittent satellite links. Critical research directions include reducing dependence on trusted nodes through quantum repeaters or post-quantum cryptography, developing standardized key management interfaces for interoperability, and adopting AI-driven predictive routing for adapting to fluctuating network states. This comprehensive synthesis of routing algorithms, performance trade-offs, and unresolved issues offers practical guidance for engineering secure, adaptable, and large-scale QKD networks capable of meeting real-world deployment demands.</description>

      <title>Event-based Data Format Standard (EVT+)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-based Sensing (EBS) hardware is quickly proliferating while finding foothold in many commercial, industrial, and defense applications. At present, there are a handful of technologically mature systems which produce data streams with diverse output formats. In the near future it is anticipated there will be vendors who offer new sensor hardware which could also yield unique data schema that are not aligned to past efforts. Thus, due to the relative nascent nature of the technology and its potential for widespread use in a variety of applications, it is an opportune time to define a standard for this class of sensors' output data. The intent of this document is to identify and provide a standard for the collected EBS streaming data. The main objective of the standard is to be sensor agnostic, incorporate some of the current sensor configurations and modalities, and account for the developing configurations and modalities. The intent is also to leave enough place holders and space in the standard for future variations that may develop as EBS technology matures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors achieve impressive accuracy under clean condition. In view of antiforensics, it is significant to develop advanced adversarial attacks for evaluating the security of such detectors, which remains unexplored sufficiently. This letter proposes a Dual-domain Feature Importance Attack (DuFIA) scheme to invalidate AIGI detectors to some extent. Forensically important features are captured by the spatially interpolated gradient and frequency-aware perturbation. The adversarial transferability is enhanced by jointly modeling spatial and frequency-domain feature importances, which are fused to guide the optimization-based adversarial example generation. Extensive experiments across various AIGI detectors verify the cross-model transferability, transparency and robustness of DuFIA.</description>

      <title>Confidential Prompting: Privacy-preserving LLM Inference on Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19134v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a vision of confidential prompting: securing user prompts from an untrusted, cloud-hosted large language model (LLM) while preserving model confidentiality, output invariance, and compute efficiency. As a first step toward this vision, we present Petridish, a system built on top of confidential computing and its core contribution, a novel technology called Secure Partitioned Decoding (SPD). Petridish runs the LLM service inside a confidential virtual machine (CVM), which protects the secrets, i.e., the LLM parameters and user prompts, from adversaries outside the CVM. Importantly, it splits the LLM service for a user into two processes, using SPD: a per-user process performs prefill with the user prompts and computes attention scores during decoding; a service process, shared by all users, batches the attention scores from per-user processes and generates output tokens for all users. Both the LLM provider and the users trust Petridish's CVM and its operating system, which guarantees isolation between processes and limits their outbound network capabilities to control information flow. The CVM's attestation capability and its open-source software stack enable Petridish to provide auditable protection of both user prompt and LLM confidentiality. Together, Petridish maintains full utility of LLM service and enables practical, privacy-preserving cloud-hosted LLM inference for sensitive applications, such as processing personal data, clinical records, and financial documents.</description>

      <title>Eguard: Defending LLM Embeddings Against Inversion Attacks via Text Mutual Information Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embeddings have become a cornerstone in the functionality of large language models (LLMs) due to their ability to transform text data into rich, dense numerical representations that capture semantic and syntactic properties. These embedding vector databases serve as the long-term memory of LLMs, enabling efficient handling of a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, the surge in popularity of embedding vector databases in LLMs has been accompanied by significant concerns about privacy leakage. Embedding vector databases are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion attacks, where adversaries can exploit the embeddings to reverse-engineer and extract sensitive information from the original text data. Existing defense mechanisms have shown limitations, often struggling to balance security with the performance of downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Eguard, a novel defense mechanism designed to mitigate embedding inversion attacks. Eguard employs a transformer-based projection network and text mutual information optimization to safeguard embeddings while preserving the utility of LLMs. Our approach significantly reduces privacy risks, protecting over 95% of tokens from inversion while maintaining high performance across downstream tasks consistent with original embeddings.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Agents: Black-Box Evasion Attacks with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attacks on machine learning models have been extensively studied through stateless optimization. In this paper, we demonstrate how a reinforcement learning (RL) agent can learn a new class of attack algorithms that generate adversarial samples. Unlike traditional adversarial machine learning (AML) methods that craft adversarial samples independently, our RL-based approach retains and exploits past attack experience to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of future attacks. We formulate adversarial sample generation as a Markov Decision Process and evaluate RL's ability to (a) learn effective and efficient attack strategies and (b) compete with state-of-the-art AML. On two image classification benchmarks, our agent increases attack success rate by up to 13.2% and decreases the average number of victim model queries per attack by up to 16.9% from the start to the end of training. In a head-to-head comparison with state-of-the-art image attacks, our approach enables an adversary to generate adversarial samples with 17% more success on unseen inputs post-training. From a security perspective, this work demonstrates a powerful new attack vector that uses RL to train agents that attack ML models efficiently and at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised a new challenge for developers since it is prone to known and unknown cyberattacks due to its heterogeneity, flexibility, and close connectivity. To defend against such security breaches, researchers have focused on building sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) using machine learning (ML) techniques. Although these algorithms notably improve detection performance, they require excessive computing power and resources, which are crucial issues in IoT networks considering the recent trends of decentralized data processing and computing systems. Consequently, many optimization techniques have been incorporated with these ML models. Specifically, a special category of optimizer adopted from the behavior of living creatures and different aspects of natural phenomena, known as metaheuristic algorithms, has been a central focus in recent years and brought about remarkable results. Considering this vital significance, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of various applications of metaheuristics algorithms in developing a machine learning-based IDS, especially for IoT. A significant contribution of this study is the discovery of hidden correlations between these optimization techniques and machine learning models integrated with state-of-the-art IoT-IDSs. In addition, the effectiveness of these metaheuristic algorithms in different applications, such as feature selection, parameter or hyperparameter tuning, and hybrid usages are separately analyzed. Moreover, a taxonomy of existing IoT-IDSs is proposed. Furthermore, we investigate several critical issues related to such integration. Our extensive exploration ends with a discussion of promising optimization algorithms and technologies that can enhance the efficiency of IoT-IDSs.</description>

      <title>The Secrets Must Not Flow: Scaling Security Verification to Large Codebases (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing program verifiers can prove advanced properties about security protocol implementations, but are difficult to scale to large codebases because of the manual effort required. We develop a novel methodology called *Diodon* that addresses this challenge by splitting the codebase into the protocol implementation (the *Core*) and the remainder (the *Application*). This split allows us to apply powerful semi-automated verification techniques to the security-critical Core, while fully-automatic static analyses scale the verification to the entire codebase by ensuring that the Application cannot invalidate the security properties proved for the Core. The static analyses achieve that by proving *I/O independence*, i.e., that the I/O operations within the Application are independent of the Core's security-relevant data (such as keys), and that the Application meets the Core's requirements. We have proved Diodon sound by first showing that we can safely allow the Application to perform I/O independent of the security protocol, and second that manual verification and static analyses soundly compose. We evaluate Diodon on two case studies: an implementation of the signed Diffie-Hellman key exchange and a large (100k+ LoC) production Go codebase implementing a key exchange protocol for which we obtained secrecy and injective agreement guarantees by verifying a Core of about 1% of the code with the auto-active program verifier Gobra in less than three person months.</description>

      <title>SoK: Exposing the Generation and Detection Gaps in LLM-Generated Phishing Through Examination of Generation Methods, Content Characteristics, and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21457</link>

Abstract: Phishing campaigns involve adversaries masquerading as trusted vendors trying to trigger user behavior that enables them to exfiltrate private data. While URLs are an important part of phishing campaigns, communicative elements like text and images are central in triggering the required user behavior. Further, due to advances in phishing detection, attackers react by scaling campaigns to larger numbers and diversifying and personalizing content. In addition to established mechanisms, such as template-based generation, large language models (LLMs) can be used for phishing content generation, enabling attacks to scale in minutes, challenging existing phishing detection paradigms through personalized content, stealthy explicit phishing keywords, and dynamic adaptation to diverse attack scenarios. Countering these dynamically changing attack campaigns requires a comprehensive understanding of the complex LLM-related threat landscape. Existing studies are fragmented and focus on specific areas. In this work, we provide the first holistic examination of LLM-generated phishing content. First, to trace the exploitation pathways of LLMs for phishing content generation, we adopt a modular taxonomy documenting nine stages by which adversaries breach LLM safety guardrails. We then characterize how LLM-generated phishing manifests as threats, revealing that it evades detectors while emphasizing human cognitive manipulation. Third, by taxonomizing defense techniques aligned with generation methods, we expose a critical asymmetry that offensive mechanisms adapt dynamically to attack scenarios, whereas defensive strategies remain static and reactive. Finally, based on a thorough analysis of the existing literature, we highlight insights and gaps and suggest a roadmap for understanding and countering LLM-driven phishing at scale.</description>

      <title>PromptCOS: Towards Content-only System Prompt Copyright Auditing for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: System prompts are critical for shaping the behavior and output quality of large language model (LLM)-based applications, driving substantial investment in optimizing high-quality prompts beyond traditional handcrafted designs. However, as system prompts become valuable intellectual property, they are increasingly vulnerable to prompt theft and unauthorized use, highlighting the urgent need for effective copyright auditing, especially watermarking. Existing methods rely on verifying subtle logit distribution shifts triggered by a query. We observe that this logit-dependent verification framework is impractical in real-world content-only settings, primarily because (1) random sampling makes content-level generation unstable for verification, and (2) stronger instructions needed for content-level signals compromise prompt fidelity.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose PromptCOS, the first content-only system prompt copyright auditing method based on content-level output similarity. PromptCOS achieves watermark stability by designing a cyclic output signal as the conditional instruction's target. It preserves prompt fidelity by injecting a small set of auxiliary tokens to encode the watermark, leaving the main prompt untouched. Furthermore, to ensure robustness against malicious removal, we optimize cover tokens, i.e., critical tokens in the original prompt, to ensure that removing auxiliary tokens causes severe performance degradation. Experimental results show that PromptCOS achieves high effectiveness (99.3% average watermark similarity), strong distinctiveness (60.8% higher than the best baseline), high fidelity (accuracy degradation no greater than 0.6%), robustness (resilience against four potential attack categories), and high computational efficiency (up to 98.1% cost saving). Our code is available at GitHub (https://github.com/LianPing-cyber/PromptCOS).</description>

      <title>SoK: Honeypots &amp; LLMs, More Than the Sum of Their Parts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised to resolve the long-standing paradox in honeypot design, achieving high-fidelity deception with low operational risk. Through a flurry of research since late 2022, steady progress from ideation to prototype implementation is exhibited. Since late 2022, a flurry of research has demonstrated steady progress from ideation to prototype implementation. While promising, evaluations show only incremental progress in real-world deployments, and the field still lacks a cohesive understanding of the emerging architectural patterns, core challenges, and evaluation paradigms. To fill this gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper provides the first comprehensive overview and analysis of this new domain. We survey and systematize the field by focusing on three critical, intersecting research areas: first, we provide a taxonomy of honeypot detection vectors, structuring the core problems that LLM-based realism must solve; second, we synthesize the emerging literature on LLM-powered honeypots, identifying a canonical architecture and key evaluation trends; and third, we chart the evolutionary path of honeypot log analysis, from simple data reduction to automated intelligence generation. We synthesize these findings into a forward-looking research roadmap, arguing that the true potential of this technology lies in creating autonomous, self-improving deception systems to counter the emerging threat of intelligent, automated attackers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between volume and surface uniform measures on n-dimensional p-balls under the p-norm. It is proved that for p=1, p=2 and p=infinity, and only for these values of p, radial projection maps a volumetrically uniform distribution to a surface-uniform distribution. Algorithms for uniform sampling on p-balls and p-spheres are provided, together with empirical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving In-Context-Learning Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed natural language understanding and generation, but they raise privacy concerns due to potential exposure of sensitive information. Studies have highlighted the risk of information leakage, where adversaries can extract sensitive information embedded in the prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel private prediction framework for generating high-quality synthetic text with strong privacy guarantees. Our approach leverages the Differential Privacy (DP) framework to ensure worst-case theoretical bounds on information leakage without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying models. The proposed method performs inference on private records and aggregates the resulting per-token output distributions. This enables the generation of longer and coherent synthetic text while maintaining privacy guarantees. Additionally, we propose a simple blending operation that combines private and public inference to further enhance utility. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, making it a promising direction for privacy-preserving text generation while maintaining high utility.

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>

      <title>FLARE: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE</description>
