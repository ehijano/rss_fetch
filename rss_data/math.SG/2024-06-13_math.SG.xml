      <title>Infinity inner products and open Gromov--Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open Gromov--Witten (OGW) potential is a function from the set of weak bounding cochains on a closed Lagrangian in a closed symplectic manifold to the Novikov ring. Existing definitions of the OGW potential assume that the ground field of the Novikov ring is either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. In this paper, we give an alternate definition of the OGW potential in the pearly model for Lagrangian Floer theory which yields an invariant valued in the Novikov ring over any field of characteristic zero. We work under simplifying regularity hypotheses which are satisfied, for instance, by any monotone Lagrangian. Our OGW potential is defined in terms of an appropriate weakening of a strictly cyclic pairing on a curved $A_{\infty}$-algebra, which can be thought of as a version of a proper Calabi--Yau structure. Such a structure is obtained by constructing a version of the cyclic open-closed map on the pearly Lagrangian Floer cochain complex. We also explain an analogue of our construction in de Rham cohomology, and show that it recovers the OGW potential constructed by Solomon and Tukachinsky.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show: the Floer homology of (nonexact!) integral Lagrangians in an (nonexact!) integral symplectic manifold can be computed in terms of exact Lagrangians in an exact filling of the prequantization bundle. As a consequence, we deduce a comparison to microsheaves. Throughout we work over the Novikov ring.</description>

      <title>Recovering generalized homology from Floer homology: the complex oriented case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate an invariant called the completed Tate cohomology to a filtered circle equivariant spectrum and a complex oriented cohomology theory. We show that when the filtered spectrum is the spectral symplectic cohomology of a Liouville manifold, this invariant depends only on the stable homotopy type of the underlying manifold. We make explicit computations for several complex oriented cohomology theories, including Eilenberg-Maclane spectra, Morava K-theories, their integral counterparts, and complex K-theory. We show that the result for Eilenberg-Maclane spectra depends only on the rational homology, and we use the computations for Morava K-theory to recover the integral homology (as an ungraded group). In a different direction, we use the completed Tate cohomology computations for the complex K-theory to recover the complex K-theory of the underlying manifold from its equivariant filtered Floer homotopy type. A key Floer theoretic input is the computation of local equivariant Floer theory near the orbit of an autonomous Hamiltonian, which may be of independent interest from the perspective of dynamics.</description>
