      <title>Homomorphism Preservation Theorems for Many-Valued Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A canonical result in model theory is the homomorphism preservation theorem which states that a first-order formula is preserved under homomorphisms on all structures if and only if it is equivalent to an existential-positive formula, standardly proved compactness. Rossman (2008) established that the h.p.t. remains valid when restricted to finite structures. This is a significant result in the field of finite model theory, standing in contrast to other preservation theorems and as an theorem which remains true in the finite but whose proof uses entirely different methods. It also has importance to the field of constraint satisfaction due to the equivalence of existential-positive formulas and unions of conjunctive queries. Adjacently, Dellunde and Vidal (2019) established that a version of the h.p.t. holds for a collection of first-order many-valued logics, those whose (possibly infinite) structures are defined over a fixed finite MTL-chain.
  In this paper we unite these two strands, showing how one can extend Rossman's proof of a finite h.p.t. to a very wide collection of many-valued predicate logics and simultaneously establishing a finite variant to Dellunde and Vidal's result, one which not only applies to structures defined over algebras more general than MTL-chains but also where we allow for those algebra to vary between models. This investigation provides a starting point in a wider development of finite model theory for many-valued logics and, just as the classical finite h.p.t. has implications for constraint satisfaction, the many-valued finite h.p.t. has implications for valued constraint satisfaction problems.</description>

      <title>Proof mining and probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theoretical framework of proof mining by establishing general logical metatheorems that allow for the extraction of the computational content of theorems with prima facie "non-computational" proofs from probability theory, thereby unlocking a major branch of mathematics as a new area of application for these methods. Concretely, we devise proof-theoretically tame logical systems that, for one, allow for the formalization of proofs involving algebras of sets together with probability contents as well as associated Lebesgue integrals on them and which, for another, are amenable to proof-theoretic metatheorems in the style of proof mining that guarantee the extractability of effective and tame bounds from larges classes of ineffective existence proofs in probability theory. Moreover, these extractable bounds are guaranteed to be highly uniform in the sense that they will be independent of all parameters relating to the underlying probability space, particularly regarding events or measures of them. As such, these results, in particular, provide the first logical explanation for the success and the observed uniformities of the previous ad hoc case studies of proof mining in these areas and further illustrate their extent. Beyond these systems, we provide extensions for the proof-theoretically tame treatment of $\sigma$-algebras and associated probability measures using an intensional approach to infinite unions. Lastly, we establish a general proof-theoretic transfer principle that allows for the lift of quantitative information on a relationship between different modes of convergence for sequences of real numbers to sequences of random variables.</description>

      <title>A Wallace semigroup whose every finite power is countably compact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, assuming the existence of $\mathfrak{c}$ incomparable selective ultrafilters, there exists a Wallace semigroup whose infinite countable power is the least power which fails to be countably compact. This answers positively Question 9.4 of \cite{Tomita15}.</description>

      <title>Around Eggleston Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation of this work are the two classical theorems on inscribing rectangles and squares into large subsets of the plane, namely Eggleston Theorem and Mycielski Theorem.
  Using Shoenfield Absoluteness Theorem we prove that for every Borel subset of the plane with uncountably many positive (with respect to measure or category) vertical section contains a rectangle $P\times B$ where $P$ is perfect and $B$ is Borel and positive. We also obtained a variant of Eggleston Theorem regarding the $\sigma$-ideal $\mathcal(E)$ generated by closed sets of measure zero.
  Furthermore we proved that every comeager (resp. conull) subset of the plane contains a rectangle $[T]\times H$, where $T$ is a Spinas tree containing a Silver tree and $H$ is comeager (resp. conull). Moreover we obtained a common generalization of Eggleston Theorem and Mycielski Theorem stating that every comeager (resp. conull) subset of the plane contains a rectangle $[T]\times H$ modulo diagonal, where $T$ is a uniformly perfect tree, $H$ is comeager (resp. conull) and $[T]\subseteq H$.</description>

      <title>On the $\infty$-topos semantics of homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many introductions to homotopy type theory and the univalence axiom gloss over the semantics of this new formal system in traditional set-based foundations. This expository article, written as lecture notes to accompany a 3-part mini course delivered at the Logic and Higher Structures workshop at CIRM-Luminy, attempts to survey the state of the art, first presenting Voevodsky's simplicial model of univalent foundations and then touring Shulman's vast generalization, which provides an interpretation of homotopy type theory with strict univalent universes in any $\infty$-topos. As we will explain, this achievement was the product of a community effort to abstract and streamline the original arguments as well as develop new lines of reasoning.</description>
