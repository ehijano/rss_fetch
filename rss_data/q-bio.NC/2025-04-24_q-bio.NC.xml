      <title>BrainPrompt: Multi-Level Brain Prompt Enhancement for Neurological Condition Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease, are challenging to diagnose, particularly in the early stages where symptoms closely resemble healthy controls. Existing brain network analysis methods primarily focus on graph-based models that rely solely on imaging data, which may overlook important non-imaging factors and limit the model's predictive power and interpretability. In this paper, we present BrainPrompt, an innovative framework that enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge-driven prompts, enabling more effective capture of complex, non-imaging information and external knowledge for neurological disease identification. BrainPrompt integrates three types of knowledge-driven prompts: (1) ROI-level prompts to encode the identity and function of each brain region, (2) subject-level prompts that incorporate demographic information, and (3) disease-level prompts to capture the temporal progression of disease. By leveraging these multi-level prompts, BrainPrompt effectively harnesses knowledge-enhanced multi-modal information from LLMs, enhancing the model's capability to predict neurological disease stages and meanwhile offers more interpretable results. We evaluate BrainPrompt on two resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets from neurological disorders, showing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a biomarker study demonstrates the framework's ability to extract valuable and interpretable information aligned with domain knowledge in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Depression Prevention via LLM-Based Dialogue Analysis: Overcoming the Limitations of Scale-Dependent Diagnosis through Precise Emotional Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing depression screening predominantly relies on standardized questionnaires (e.g., PHQ-9, BDI), which suffer from high misdiagnosis rates (18-34% in clinical studies) due to their static, symptom-counting nature and susceptibility to patient recall bias. This paper presents an AI-powered depression prevention system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze real-time conversational cues--including subtle emotional expressions (e.g., micro-sentiment shifts, self-referential language patterns)--for more accurate and dynamic mental state assessment. Our system achieves three key innovations: (1) Continuous monitoring through natural dialogue, detecting depression-indicative linguistic features (anhedonia markers, hopelessness semantics) with 89% precision (vs. 72% for PHQ-9); (2) Adaptive risk stratification that updates severity levels based on conversational context, reducing false positives by 41% compared to scale-based thresholds; and (3) Personalized intervention strategies tailored to users' emotional granularity, demonstrating 2.3x higher adherence rates than generic advice. Clinical validation with 450 participants shows the system identifies 92% of at-risk cases missed by traditional scales, while its explainable AI interface bridges the gap between automated analysis and clinician judgment. This work establishes conversational AI as a paradigm shift from episodic scale-dependent diagnosis to continuous, emotionally intelligent mental health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Cells Sensible to Curvature and Their Receptive Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model of the functional architecture of curvature sensible cells in the visual cortex that associates curvature with scale. The feature space of orientation and position is naturally enhanced via its oriented prolongation, yielding a 4-dimensional manifold endowed with a canonical Engel structure. This structure encodes position, orientation, signed curvature, and scale. We associate an open submanifold of the prolongation with the quasi-regular representation of the similitude group SIM (2), and find left-invariant generators for the Engel structure. Finally, we use the generators of the Engel structure to characterize curvature-sensitive receptive profiles .</description>

      <title>Application of an attention-based CNN-BiLSTM framework for in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal ensembles: decoding complex bilateral forelimb movements from unilateral M1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding behavior, such as movement, from multiscale brain networks remains a central objective in neuroscience. Over the past decades, artificial intelligence and machine learning have played an increasingly significant role in elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying motor function. The advancement of brain-monitoring technologies, capable of capturing complex neuronal signals with high spatial and temporal resolution, necessitates the development and application of more sophisticated machine learning models for behavioral decoding. In this study, we employ a hybrid deep learning framework, an attention-based CNN-BiLSTM model, to decode skilled and complex forelimb movements using signals obtained from in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Our findings demonstrate that the intricate movements of both ipsilateral and contralateral forelimbs can be accurately decoded from unilateral M1 neuronal ensembles. These results highlight the efficacy of advanced hybrid deep learning models in capturing the spatiotemporal dependencies of neuronal networks activity linked to complex movement execution.</description>

      <title>Summary statistics of learning link changing neural representations to behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we make sense of large-scale recordings of neural activity across learning? Theories of neural network learning with their origins in statistical physics offer a potential answer: for a given task, there are often a small set of summary statistics that are sufficient to predict performance as the network learns. Here, we review recent advances in how summary statistics can be used to build theoretical understanding of neural network learning. We then argue for how this perspective can inform the analysis of neural data, enabling better understanding of learning in biological and artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Spot solutions to a neural field equation on oblate spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of excitation patterns in neural fields is an important topic in neuroscience. Neural field equations are mathematical models that describe the excitation dynamics of interacting neurons to perform the theoretical analysis. Although many analyses of neural field equations focus on the effect of neuronal interactions on the flat surface, the geometric constraint of the dynamics is also an attractive topic when modeling organs such as the brain. This paper reports pattern dynamics in a neural field equation defined on spheroids as model curved surfaces. We treat spot solutions as localized patterns and discuss how the geometric properties of the curved surface change their properties. To analyze spot patterns on spheroids with small flattening, we first construct exact stationary spot solutions on the spherical surface and reveal their stability. We then extend the analysis to show the existence and stability of stationary spot solutions in the spheroidal case. One of our theoretical results is the derivation of a stability criterion for stationary spot solutions localized at poles on oblate spheroids. The criterion determines whether a spot solution remains at a pole or moves away. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to discuss the dynamics of spot solutions with the insight of our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the dynamics of spot solutions depend on the curved surface and the coordination of neural interactions.</description>

      <title>A Few-Shot Metric Learning Method with Dual-Channel Attention for Cross-Modal Same-Neuron Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neuroscience research, achieving single-neuron matching across different imaging modalities is critical for understanding the relationship between neuronal structure and function. However, modality gaps and limited annotations present significant challenges. We propose a few-shot metric learning method with a dual-channel attention mechanism and a pretrained vision transformer to enable robust cross-modal neuron identification. The local and global channels extract soma morphology and fiber context, respectively, and a gating mechanism fuses their outputs. To enhance the model's fine-grained discrimination capability, we introduce a hard sample mining strategy based on the MultiSimilarityMiner algorithm, along with the Circle Loss function. Experiments on two-photon and fMOST datasets demonstrate superior Top-K accuracy and recall compared to existing methods. Ablation studies and t-SNE visualizations validate the effectiveness of each module. The method also achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies. These results suggest that the proposed approach offers a promising technical solution for accurate single-cell level matching and multimodal neuroimaging integration.</description>

      <title>A simple EEG-based decision tool for neonatal therapeutic hypothermia in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate identification of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the early neonatal period is essential for initiating therapeutic hypothermia (TH) within 6 hours of birth to optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes. We aimed to develop a simple decision-making tool for identifying term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) based on features of conventional electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded within 6 hours of birth. EEG recordings from 100 full-term neonates with HIE were graded by pediatric neurologists for severity. Amplitude in slow frequency bands was analyzed, focusing on delta (0.5-4 Hz) spectral power. Temporal fluctuations of delta power characterized each HIE grade, with joint level and duration probability densities estimated for delta oscillation power. This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05114070). These 2D EEG representations effectively distinguish mild HIE cases from those requiring hypothermia, achieving 98% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 99% positive predictive value, 94% negative predictive value, an F1 score of 99%, and a false alarm rate of only 6%. This system accurately discriminates mild from moderate or severe HIE, with only one mild case mistakenly identified as requiring hypothermia. Quantized probability densities of delta spectral features from early EEG (within 6 hours of birth) revealed significant differences between mild and moderate or severe HIE, enabling accurate discrimination of candidates for TH. Simple, interpretable biomarkers from early EEG can provide an efficient visual clinical decision support tool to identify full-term neonates with HIE eligible for therapeutic hypothermia.</description>
