      <title>Repairing the algebraic foundations of the Standard Model of particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is in such good quantitative agreement with experiment that it is still accepted as providing an accurate model of reality, with the role of chiral symmetry in electro-weak unification regarded as one of its major achievements. Nevertheless, its conceptual and algebraic foundations are faulty. This work identifies these, and shows how they are repaired in Clifford Unification (CU). Chirality is algebraically inconsistent with neutrinos having finite mass and can no longer be regarded as a quantum number. The SM description of parity is shown to be inadequate and is replaced. Hypercharge $Y$ and iso-spin $I_z$ quantum numbers conflict with the CU description of fermions. It is argued that these faults make theoretical extensions that simply ``go beyond'' the SM impossible, and can produce erroneous interpretations of experimental results.</description>

      <title>Entanglement enhancement with the biased Werner density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The separability of quantum systems, particularly in mixed states, remains a fundamental challenge in quantum mechanics. The Werner density matrix, a widely studied representation of bipartite mixed quantum systems, has provided valuable insights into entanglement, nonlocality, and separability. In this work, we propose an extension to the Werner density matrix by introducing a classical bias while preserving the independence of the two particles. Using the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion, we demonstrate that this biased Werner density matrix enlarges the entangled state region, suggesting that the classical bias enhances the formation of quantum entanglement. Furthermore, we show that the entanglement enhancement persists when classical dependence is introduced. Our results suggest that careful mixing of classical and quantum components can render a state separable, even when both components exhibit correlations and entanglement.</description>

      <title>What Exactly is Antimatter (Gravitationally Speaking)? A Second Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.10954 I investigated the consequences of regarding the mass-energy of the fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) and the Intermediate Vector Bosons (e.g., photon) as matter, and the fundamental antifermions (antiquarks and antileptons) as antimatter within the context of an antigravity universe, one where matter and antimatter repel gravitationally. Here I consider an alternative scenario in which the Intermediate Vector Bosons, which are neither particle nor antiparticle, are gravitationally attracted to both fundamental fermions and antifermions. This leads to a prediction for the free-fall acceleration of antihydrogen of $a_{\bar{H}}=(0.78^{+0.11}_{-0.08})g$ (and most certainly less than $g$) as well as quite different expectations for the free-fall accelerations of the $\mu^+$ and positronium from those derived in arXiv:2401.10954. The cosmology which results from the premise presented here is little different from the standard cosmology (i.e., the $\Lambda$CDM model). One significant deviation is that there would be an increased accelerated expansion in the early moments after the Big Bang due to the gravitational repulsion between the fundamental fermions and antifermions.</description>
