      <title>Optimal transfer operators in algebraic two-level methods for nonsymmetric and indefinite problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an algebraic two-level method applied to the $n$-dimensional linear system $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ using fine-space preconditioner (i.e., ``relaxation'' or ``smoother'' in the context of multigrid) $M$, with $M \approx A$, restriction and interpolation $R$ and $P$, and algebraic coarse-space operator ${A_c := R^*AP}$. Then, what are the the best possible transfer operators $R$ and $P$ of a given dimension $n_c &lt; n$? Brannick et al. (2018) showed that when $A$ and $M$ are Hermitian positive definite (HPD), the optimal interpolation is such that its range contains the $n_c$ smallest generalized eigenvectors of the matrix pencil $(A, M)$. Recently, Ali et al. (2025) generalized this framework to the non-HPD setting, by considering both right (interpolation) and left (restriction) generalized eigenvectors of $(A, M)$, but were unable to show norm-based convergence or optimality. Moreover, the transfer operators as derived therein are typically complex valued, which is not practical for real-valued problems, as usually arise in the context of numerical partial differential equations, for example. Here we significantly strengthen the results from Ali et al., first characterizing all inner products in which the resulting coarse-space correction defined by these transfer operators is orthogonal. We then develop tight two-level convergence bounds in these norms, and prove that the underlying transfer operators are genuinely optimal in these norms. As a special case, our theory both recovers and extends the HPD results from Brannick et al. Finally, we show how to construct optimal, real-valued transfer operators in the case of that $A$ and $M$ are real valued, but are not symmetric positive definite. Numerical examples arising from discretized advection and wave-equation problems are used to verify and illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Stability analyses of divergence and vorticity damping on gnomonic cubed-sphere grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divergence and vorticity damping are explicit diffusion mechanisms used in dynamical cores to ensure numerical stability. There is a mesh-dependent upper bound on the corresponding diffusion coefficient, else the diffusion itself becomes a source of instability. This work considers such stability limits for three gnomonic cubed-sphere meshes -- 1) equidistant, 2) equiangular, and 3) equi-edge mappings. Von Neumann analysis is used to derive linear stability limits, which show that the stability of divergence and vorticity damping depends on the cell areas and aspect ratios of the cubed-sphere grid. The linear theory is compared to practical divergence and vorticity damping limits in the CAM-FV3 dynamical core, using a baroclinic wave test case on the equiangular and equi-edge grids. For divergence damping, both the magnitude of maximum stable coefficients and the locations of instability agree with linear theory. Due to implicit vorticity diffusion from the transport scheme, practical limits for vorticity damping are lower than the explicit stability limits. The maximum allowable vorticity damping coefficient varies with the choice of horizontal transport scheme for the equi-edge grid; it is hypothesised that this indicates the relative implicit diffusion of the transport scheme in this test.</description>

      <title>Projection-free approximation of flows of harmonic maps with quadratic constraint accuracy and variable step sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and analyze a projection-free linearly implicit method for the approximation of flows of harmonic maps into spheres. The proposed method is unconditionally energy stable and, under a sharp discrete regularity condition, achieves second order accuracy with respect to the constraint violation. Furthermore, the method accommodates variable step sizes to speed up the convergence to stationary points and to improve the accuracy of the numerical solutions near singularities, without affecting the unconditional energy stability and the constraint violation property. We illustrate the accuracy in approximating the unit-length constraint and the performance of the method through a series of numerical experiments, and compare it with the linearly implicit Euler and two-step BDF methods.</description>

      <title>On the Stability Barrier of Hermite Type Discretizations of Advection Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a stability barrier of a class of high-order Hermite-type discretization of 1D advection equations underlying the hybrid-variable (HV) and active flux (AF) methods. These methods seek numerical approximations to both cell-averages and nodal solutions and evolves them in time simultaneously. It was shown in earlier work that the HV methods are supraconvergent, providing that the discretization uses more unknowns in the upwind direction than the downwind one, similar to the "upwind condition" of classical finite-difference schemes. Although it is well known that the stencil of finite-difference methods could not be too biased towards the upwind direction for stability consideration, known as "stability barrier", such a barrier has not been established for Hermite-type methods. In this work, we first show by numerical evidence that a similar barrier exists for HV methods and make a conjecture on the sharp bound on the stencil. Next, we prove the existence of stability barrier by showing that the semi-discretized HV methods are unstable given a stencil sufficiently biased towards the upwind direction. Tighter barriers are then proved using combinatorical tools, and finally we extend the analysis to studying other Hermite-type methods built on approximating nodal solutions and derivatives, such as those widely used in Hermite WENO methods.</description>

      <title>A review of discontinuous Galerkin time-stepping methods for wave propagation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter reviews and compares discontinuous Galerkin time-stepping methods for the numerical approximation of second-order ordinary differential equations, particularly those stemming from space finite element discretization of wave propagation problems. Two formulations, tailored for second- and first-order systems of ordinary differential equations, are discussed within a generalized framework, assessing their stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Theoretical results are supported by various illustrative examples that validate the findings, enhancing the understanding and applicability of these methods in practical scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We thoroughly investigate Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations as time integrators for second-order oscillatory systems, considering both second-order and first-order formulations of the original problem. Key contributions include new convergence analyses for the second-order formulation and equivalence proofs between DG and classical time-stepping schemes (such as Newmark schemes and general linear methods). In addition, the chapter provides a detailed review and convergence analysis for the first-order formulation, alongside comparisons of the proposed schemes in terms of accuracy, consistency, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Triangular preconditioners for double saddle point linear systems arising in the mixed form of poroelasticity equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of inexact block triangular preconditioners for double saddle-point symmetric linear systems arising from the mixed finite element and mixed hybrid finite element discretization of Biot's poroelasticity equations. We develop a spectral analysis of the preconditioned matrix, showing that the complex eigenvalues lie in a circle of center $(1,0)$ and radius smaller than 1. In contrast, the real eigenvalues are described in terms of the roots of a third-degree polynomial with real coefficients. The results of numerical experiments are reported to show the quality of the theoretical bounds and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioners used with GMRES, especially in comparison with similar block diagonal preconditioning strategies along with the MINRES iteration.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally local bounds preserving numerical scheme based on inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for advection on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an implicit numerical scheme for the solution of advection equation where the roles of space and time variables are exchanged using the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure. The scheme contains a linear weight for which it is always second order accurate in time and space, and the stencil in the implicit part is fully upwinded for any value of the weight, enabling a direct computation of numerical solutions by forward substitution. To fulfill the local bounds for the solution represented by the discrete minimum and maximum principle (DMP), we use a predicted value obtained with the linear weight and check a priori if the DMP is valid. If not, we can use either a nonlinear weight or a limiter function that depends on Courant number and apply such a high-resolution version of the scheme to obtain a corrected value. The advantage of the scheme obtained with the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure is that only in the case of too small Courant numbers, the limiting is towards the first order accurate scheme, which is not a situation occurring in numerical simulations with implicit schemes very often. In summary, the local bounds are satisfied up to rounding errors unconditionally for any Courant numbers, and the formulas for the predictor and the corrector are explicit. The high-resolution scheme can be extended straightforwardly for advection with nonlinear retardation coefficient with numerical solutions satisfying the DMP, and a scalar nonlinear algebraic equation has to be solved to obtain each predicted and corrected value. In numerical experiments, including transport on a sewer network, we can confirm the advantageous properties of numerical solutions for several representative examples.</description>

      <title>A Convergent Inexact Abedin-Kitagawa Iteration Method for Monge-Amp\`ere Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an inexact Aleksandrov solution based Abedin-Kitagawa iteration (AKI) method for solving (real) Monge-Amp{\`e}re eigenvalue problems. The proposed approach utilizes the convergent Rayleigh inverse iterative formulation introduced by Abedin and Kitagawa as the prototype. More importantly, it employs an error tolerance criterion of inexact Aleksandrov solutions to approximately solve the subproblems without spoiling the convergence, which becomes the most crucial issue for the efficient implementation of the iterative method. For the two-dimensional case, by properly taking advantage of the flexibility rendered by the proposed inexact approach and a convergent fixed-point-based approach to solve the subproblems, considerable advancements in computational efficiency can be achieved by the inexact AKI method with its convergence under the ${\cal C}^{2,\alpha}$ boundary condition being rigorously established. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed inexact AKI method. The numerical results suggest that the inexact AKI method can be more than eight times faster than the original AKI method, at least for all the tested problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient time-domain scattering synthesis via frequency-domain singularity subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier-transform-based methods enable accurate, dispersion-free
  simulations of time-domain scattering problems by evaluating
  solutions to the Helmholtz equation at a discrete set of
  frequencies, sufficient to approximate the inverse Fourier
  transform. However, in the case of scattering by trapping obstacles,
  the Helmholtz solution exhibits nearly-real complex
  resonances -- which significantly slows the convergence of numerical
  inverse transform. To address this difficulty this paper introduces
  a frequency-domain singularity subtraction technique that
  regularizes the integrand of the inverse transform and efficiently
  computes the singularity contribution via a combination of a
  straightforward and inexpensive numerical technique together with a
  large-time asymptotic expansion. Crucially, all relevant
  complex resonances and their residues are determined via rational
  approximation of integral equation solutions at real
  frequencies. An adaptive algorithm is employed to ensure that all
  relevant complex resonances are properly identified.</description>

      <title>Stable fully practical finite element methods for axisymmetric Willmore flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fully discrete numerical approximations for axisymmetric Willmore flow that are unconditionally stable and work reliably without remeshing. We restrict our attention to surfaces without boundary, but allow for spontaneous curvature effects. The axisymmetric setting allows us to formulate our schemes in terms of the generating curve of the considered surface. We propose a novel weak formulation, that combines an evolution equation for the surface's mean curvature and the curvature identity of the generating curve. The mean curvature is used to describe the gradient flow structure, which enables an unconditional stability result for the discrete solutions. The generating curve's curvature, on the other hand, describes the surface's in-plane principal curvature and plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier for an equidistribution property on the discrete level. We introduce two fully discrete schemes and prove their unconditional stability. Numerical results are provided to confirm the convergence, stability and equidistribution properties of the introduced schemes.</description>

Abstract: For scientific machine learning tasks with a lot of custom code, picking the right Automatic Differentiation (AD) system matters. Our Julia package DifferentiationInterface.jl provides a common frontend to a dozen AD backends, unlocking easy comparison and modular development. In particular, its built-in preparation mechanism leverages the strengths of each backend by amortizing one-time computations. This is key to enabling sophisticated features like sparsity handling without putting additional burdens on the user.</description>

      <title>On removing orders from amplitude equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a modified version of the renormalization group (RG) method and test its numerical accuracy. It has been tested on numerous scalar ODEs and systems of ODEs. Our method is primarily motivated by the possibility of simplifying amplitude equations. The key feature of our method is the introduction of a new homogeneous function at each order of the perturbation hierarchy, which is then used to remove terms from the amplitude equations. We have shown that there is a limit to how many terms can be removed, as doing so beyond a certain point would reintroduce linear growth. There is thus a \textit{core} in the amplitude equation, which consists of the terms that cannot be removed while avoiding linear growth. Using our modified RG method, higher accuracy can also be achieved while maintaining the same level of complexity in the amplitude equation.</description>

      <title>A Gradient-thresholding Algorithm for Sparse Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.03437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse problems arise in a wide spectrum of applications in fields ranging from engineering to scientific computation. Connected with the rise of interest in inverse problems is the development and analysis of regularization methods, such as Tikhonov-type regularization methods or iterative regularization methods, which are a necessity in most of the inverse problems. In the last few decades, regularization methods motivating sparsity has been the focus of research, due to the high dimensionalty of the real-life data, and $\mathcal{L}^1$-regularization methods (such as LASSO or FISTA) has been in its center (due to their computational simplicity). In this paper we propose a new (semi-) iterative regularization method which is not only simpler than the mentioned algorithms but also yields better results, in terms of accuracy and sparsity of the recovered solution. Furthermore, we also present a very effective and practical stopping criterion to choose an appropriate regularization parameter (here, it's iteration index) so as to recover a regularized (sparse) solution. To illustrate the computational efficiency of this algorithm we apply it to numerically solve the image deblurring problem and compare our results with certain standard regularization methods, like total variation, FISTA, LSQR etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss vertex patch smoothers as overlapping domain decomposition methods for fourth order elliptic partial differential equations. We show that they are numerically very efficient and yield high convergence rates. Furthermore, we discuss low rank tensor approximations for their efficient implementation. Our experiments demonstrate that the inexact local solver yields a method which converges fast and uniformly with respect to mesh refinement. The multiplicative smoother shows superior performance in terms of solution efficiency, requiring fewer iterations. However, in three-dimensional cases, the additive smoother outperforms its multiplicative counterpart due to the latter's lower potential for parallelism. Additionally, the solver infrastructure supports a mixed-precision approach, executing the multigrid preconditioner in single precision while performing the outer iteration in double precision, thereby increasing throughput by up to 70 percent.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Optimal Least Squares: Inhomogeneous boundary conditions, and application with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct least squares formulations of PDEs with inhomogeneous essential boundary conditions, where boundary residuals are not measured in unpractical fractional Sobolev norms, but which formulations nevertheless are shown to yield a quasi-best approximations from the employed trial spaces. Dual norms do enter the least-squares functional, so that solving the least squares problem amounts to solving a saddle point or minimax problem. For finite element applications we construct uniformly stable finite element pairs, whereas for Machine Learning applications we employ adversarial networks.</description>

      <title>Conformal variational discretisation of infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems with gradient flow dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonconservative evolution problems describe irreversible processes and dissipative effects in a broad variety of phenomena. Such problems are often characterised by a conservative part, which can be modelled as a Hamiltonian term, and a nonconservative part, in the form of gradient flow dissipation. Traditional numerical approximations of this class of problem typically fail to retain the separation into conservative and nonconservative parts hence leading to unphysical solutions. In this work we propose a mixed variational method that gives a semi-discrete problem with the same geometric structure as the infinite-dimensional problem. As a consequence the conservation laws and the dissipative terms are retained. A priori convergence estimates on the solution are established. Numerical tests of the Korteweg-de Vries equation and of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on the torus and on the sphere are presented to corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The Adini finite element on locally refined meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a locally refined version of the Adini finite element for the planar biharmonic equation on rectangular partitions with at most one hanging node per edge. If global continuity of the discrete functions is enforced, for such method there is some freedom in assigning the normal derivative degree of freedom at the hanging nodes. It is proven that the convergence order $h^2$ known for regular solutions and regular partitions is lost for any such choice, and that assigning the average of the normal derivatives at the neighbouring regular vertices is the only choice that achieves a superlinear order, namely $h^{3/2}$ on uniformly refined meshes. On adaptive meshes, the method behaves like a first-order scheme. Furthermore, the reliability and efficiency of an explicit residual-based error estimator are shown up to the best approximation of the Hessian by certain piecewise polynomial functions.</description>

      <title>Relation between two Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra integral equations of the second kind and further improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two different Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra integral equations of the second kind have been independently proposed by Stenger and Rashidinia--Zarebnia. However, their relation remains unexplored. This study theoretically examines the solutions of these two methods, and reveals that they are not generally equivalent, despite coinciding at the collocation points. Strictly speaking, Stenger's method assumes that the kernel of the integral is a function of a single variable, but this study theoretically justifies the use of his method in general cases, i.e., the kernel is a function of two variables. Then, this study rigorously proves that both methods can attain the same, root-exponential convergence. In addition to the contribution, this study improves Stenger's method to attain significantly higher, almost exponential convergence. Numerical examples supporting the theoretical results are also provided.</description>

      <title>Improving the scalability of a high-order atmospheric dynamics solver based on the deal.II library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present recent advances on the massively parallel performance of a numerical scheme for atmosphere dynamics applications based on the deal.II library. The implicit-explicit discontinuous finite element scheme is based on a matrix-free approach, meaning that no global sparse matrix is built and only the action of the linear operators on a vector is actually implemented. Following a profiling analysis, we focus on the performance optimization of the numerical method and describe the impact of different preconditioning and solving techniques in this framework. Moreover, we show how the use of the latest version of the deal.II library and of suitable execution flags can improve the parallel performance.</description>

      <title>Sparse inverse Cholesky factorization of dense kernel matrices by greedy conditional selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense kernel matrices resulting from pairwise evaluations of a kernel function arise naturally in machine learning and statistics. Previous work in constructing sparse approximate inverse Cholesky factors of such matrices by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence recovers the Vecchia approximation for Gaussian processes. These methods rely only on the geometry of the evaluation points to construct the sparsity pattern. In this work, we instead construct the sparsity pattern by leveraging a greedy selection algorithm that maximizes mutual information with target points, conditional on all points previously selected. For selecting $k$ points out of $N$, the naive time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N k^4)$, but by maintaining a partial Cholesky factor we reduce this to $\mathcal{O}(N k^2)$. Furthermore, for multiple ($m$) targets we achieve a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N k^2 + N m^2 + m^3)$, which is maintained in the setting of aggregated Cholesky factorization where a selected point need not condition every target. We apply the selection algorithm to image classification and recovery of sparse Cholesky factors. By minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence, we apply the algorithm to Cholesky factorization, Gaussian process regression, and preconditioning with the conjugate gradient, improving over $k$-nearest neighbors selection.</description>

      <title>Optimization perspective on raking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Raking is widely used in survey inference and global health models to adjust the observations in contingency tables to given marginals, in the latter case reconciling estimates between models with different granularities. We review the convex optimization foundation of raking and focus on a dual perspective that simplifies and streamlines prior raking extensions and provides new functionality, enabling a unified approach to n-dimensional raking, raking with differential weights, ensuring bounds on estimates are respected, raking to margins either as hard constraints or as aggregate observations, handling missing data, and allowing efficient uncertainty propagation. The dual perspective also enables a uniform fast and scalable matrix-free optimization approach for all of these extensions. All of the methods are implemented in an open source Python package with an intuitive user interface, installable from PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/raking/), and we illustrate the capabilities using synthetic data and real mortality estimates.</description>

      <title>Distillation of Discrete Diffusion through Dimensional Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performances in various fields of generative modeling, but suffer from slow sampling speed due to their iterative nature. While this issue is being addressed in continuous domains, discrete diffusion models face unique challenges, particularly in capturing dependencies between elements (e.g., pixel relationships in image, sequential dependencies in language) mainly due to the computational cost of processing high-dimensional joint distributions. In this paper, (i) we propose "mixture" models for discrete diffusion that are capable of treating dimensional correlations while remaining scalable, and (ii) we provide a set of loss functions for distilling the iterations of existing models. Two primary theoretical insights underpin our approach: First, conventional models with element-wise independence can well approximate the data distribution, but essentially require {\it many sampling steps}. Second, our loss functions enable the mixture models to distill such many-step conventional models into just a few steps by learning the dimensional correlations. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling pretrained discrete diffusion models across image and language domains.

      <title>Code-Verification Techniques for an Arbitrary-Depth Electromagnetic Slot Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic slot models are employed to efficiently simulate electromagnetic penetration through openings in an otherwise closed electromagnetic scatterer. Such models, which incorporate varying assumptions about the geometry of the openings, are typically coupled with electromagnetic surface integral equations that model electromagnetic scattering. In this paper, we introduce novel code-verification approaches and build upon our previously developed methodologies to assess the correctness of the numerical implementation of an arbitrary-depth slot model. Through these approaches, we measure the convergence rates of the different interacting sources of numerical error and demonstrate the impact of various factors on these rates for several cases.</description>

      <title>Exploring exponential time integration for strongly magnetized charged particle motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental task in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of plasma physics is solving for charged particle motion in electromagnetic fields. This problem is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized due to numerical stiffness arising from the wide separation in time scales between highly oscillatory gyromotion and overall macroscopic behavior of the system. In contrast to conventional finite difference schemes, we investigated exponential integration techniques to numerically simulate strongly magnetized charged particle motion. Numerical experiments with a uniform magnetic field show that exponential integrators yield superior performance for linear problems (i.e. configurations with an electric field given by a quadratic electric scalar potential) and are competitive with conventional methods for nonlinear problems with cubic and quartic electric scalar potentials.</description>
