      <title>Optimal portfolio under ratio-type periodic evaluation in stochastic factor models under convex trading constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a type of periodic utility maximization problems for portfolio management in incomplete stochastic factor models with convex trading constraints. The portfolio performance is periodically evaluated on the relative ratio of two adjacent wealth levels over an infinite horizon, featuring the dynamic adjustments in portfolio decision according to past achievements. Under power utility, we transform the original infinite horizon optimal control problem into an auxiliary terminal wealth optimization problem under a modified utility function. To cope with the convex trading constraints, we further introduce an auxiliary unconstrained optimization problem in a modified market model and develop the martingale duality approach to establish the existence of the dual minimizer such that the optimal unconstrained wealth process can be obtained using the dual representation. With the help of the duality results in the auxiliary problems, the relationship between the constrained and unconstrained models as well as some fixed point arguments, we finally derive and verify the optimal constrained portfolio process in a periodic manner for the original problem over an infinite horizon.</description>

      <title>Analytical Formula for Fractional-Order Conditional Moments of Nonlinear Drift CEV Process with Regime Switching: Hybrid Approach with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an analytical formula for the fractional-order conditional moments of nonlinear drift constant elasticity of variance (NLD-CEV) processes under regime switching, governed by continuous-time finite-state irreducible Markov chains. By employing a hybrid system approach, we derive exact closed-form expressions for these moments across arbitrary fractional orders and regime states, thereby enhancing the analytical tractability of NLD-CEV models under stochastic regimes. Our methodology hinges on formulating and solving a complex system of interconnected partial differential equations derived from the Feynman--Kac formula for switching diffusions. To illustrate the practical relevance of our approach, Monte Carlo simulations for process with Markovian switching are applied to validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the analytical formulas. Furthermore, we apply our findings for the valuation of financial derivatives within a dynamic nonlinear mean-reverting regime-switching framework, which demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods. This work offers substantial contributions to financial modeling and derivative pricing by providing a robust tool for practitioners and researchers who are dealing with complex stochastic environments.</description>

      <title>Finding the nonnegative minimal solutions of Cauchy PDEs in a volatility-stabilized market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative arbitrage problem in Stochastic Portfolio Theory seeks to generate an investment strategy that almost surely outperforms a benchmark portfolio at the end of a certain time horizon. The highest relative return in relative arbitrage opportunities is related to the smallest nonnegative continuous solution of a Cauchy PDE. However, solving the PDE poses analytical and numerical challenges, due to the high dimensionality and its non-unique solutions. In this paper, we discuss numerical methods to address the relative arbitrage problem and the associated PDE in a volatility-stabilized market using time-changed Bessel bridges. We present a practical algorithm and demonstrate numerical results through an example in volatility-stabilized markets.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Markowitz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Markowitz portfolio optimization constrains daily portfolio variance to a target value, optimising returns, Sharpe or variance within this constraint. However, this approach overlooks the relationship between variance at different time scales, typically described by $\sigma(\Delta t) \propto (\Delta t)^{H}$ where $H$ is the Hurst exponent, most of the time assumed to be \(\frac{1}{2}\). This paper introduces a multifrequency optimization framework that allows investors to specify target portfolio variance across a range of frequencies, characterized by a target Hurst exponent $H_{target}$, or optimize the portfolio at multiple time scales. By incorporating this scaling behavior, we enable a more nuanced and comprehensive risk management strategy that aligns with investor preferences at various time scales. This approach effectively manages portfolio risk across multiple frequencies and adapts to different market conditions, providing a robust tool for dynamic asset allocation. This overcomes some of the traditional limitations of Markowitz, when it comes to dealing with crashes, regime changes, volatility clustering or multifractality in markets. We illustrate this concept with a toy example and discuss the practical implementation for assets with varying scaling behaviors.</description>

      <title>Set-valued stochastic integrals for convoluted L\'{e}vy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study set-valued Volterra-type stochastic integrals driven by L\'{e}vy processes. Upon extending the classical definitions of set-valued stochastic integral functionals to convoluted integrals with square-integrable kernels, set-valued convoluted stochastic integrals are defined by taking the closed decomposable hull of the integral functionals for generic time. We show that, aside from well-established results for set-valued It\^{o} integrals, while set-valued stochastic integrals with respect to a finite-variation Poisson random measure are guaranteed to be integrably bounded for bounded integrands, this is not true when the random measure is of infinite variation. For indefinite integrals, we prove that it is a mutual effect of kernel singularity and jumps that the set-valued convoluted integrals are possibly explosive and take extended vector values. These results have some important implications on how set-valued fractional dynamical systems are to be constructed in general. Two classes of set-monotone processes are studied for practical interests in economic and financial modeling.</description>
