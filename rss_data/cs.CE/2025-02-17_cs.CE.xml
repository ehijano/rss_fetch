      <title>Towards personalised assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysm structural integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition involving the permanent dilation of the aorta, often detected incidentally through imaging for some other condition. The standard clinical approach to managing AAA follows a one-size-fits-all model based on aneurysm size and growth rate, leading to underestimation or overestimation of rupture risk in individual patients. The widely studied stress-based rupture risk estimation using computational biomechanics requires wall strength information. However, non-invasive methods for local patient-specific wall strength measurement have not yet been developed. Recently, we introduced an image-based approach for patient-specific, in vivo, non-invasive AAA kinematic analysis using time-resolved 3D computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA) images to measure wall strain throughout the cardiac cycle. In the present study, we integrated wall tension computation and strain measurement to develop a novel measure of local structural integrity of AAA wall - Relative Structural Integrity Index (RSII), independent of material properties and thickness of the wall and conditions of blood pressure measurement. Our methods provide a visual map of AAA wall structural integrity for individual patients using only their medical images and blood pressure data. We applied our methods to twelve patients. Additionally, we compared our measure of structural integrity of aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal aortas. Our results show similar values of the wall structural integrity measure across the patients, indicating the reliability of our methods. In line with experimental observations reported in the literature, our analysis revealed that localized low stiffness areas are primarily found in the most dilated AAA regions. Our results clearly demonstrate that the AAA wall is stiffer than the non-aneurysmal aorta.</description>

      <title>RoadFed: A Multimodal Federated Learning System for Improving Road Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoTs) have been widely applied in Collaborative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) for the prevention of road accidents. As one of the primary causes of road accidents in C-ITS, the efficient detection and early alarm of road hazards are of paramount importance. Given the importance, extensive research has explored this topic and obtained favorable results. However, most existing solutions only explore single-modality data, struggle with high computation and communication overhead, or suffer from the curse of high dimensionality in their privacy-preserving methodologies. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper, we introduce RoadFed, an innovative and private multimodal Federated learning-based system tailored for intelligent Road hazard detection and alarm. This framework encompasses an innovative Multimodal Road Hazard Detector, a communication-efficient federated learning approach, and a customized low-error-rate local differential privacy method crafted for high dimensional multimodal data. Experimental results reveal that the proposed RoadFed surpasses most existing systems in the self-gathered real-world and CrisisMMD public datasets. In particular, RoadFed achieves an accuracy of 96.42% with a mere 0.0351 seconds of latency and its communication cost is up to 1,000 times lower than existing systems in this field. It facilitates collaborative training with non-iid high dimensional multimodal real-world data across various data modalities on multiple edges while ensuring privacy preservation for road users.</description>

      <title>Gradient GA: Gradient Genetic Algorithm for Drug Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular discovery has brought great benefits to the chemical industry. Various molecule design techniques are developed to identify molecules with desirable properties. Traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, continue to achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple molecular design benchmarks. However, these techniques rely solely on random walk exploration, which hinders both the quality of the final solution and the convergence speed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Gradient Genetic Algorithm (Gradient GA), which incorporates gradient information from the objective function into genetic algorithms. Instead of random exploration, each proposed sample iteratively progresses toward an optimal solution by following the gradient direction. We achieve this by designing a differentiable objective function parameterized by a neural network and utilizing the Discrete Langevin Proposal to enable gradient guidance in discrete molecular spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves both convergence speed and solution quality, outperforming cutting-edge techniques. For example, it achieves up to a 25% improvement in the top-10 score over the vanilla genetic algorithm. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/debadyuti23/GradientGA.</description>

      <title>Statistical data analysis for Tourism in Poland in R Programming Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study utilises the R programming language for statistical data analysis to understand Tourism dynamics in Poland. It focuses on methods for data visualisation, multivariate statistics, and hypothesis testing. To investigate the expenditure behavior of tourist, spending patterns, correlations, and associations among variables were analysed in the dataset. The results revealed a significant relationship between accommodation type and the purpose of trip, showing that the purpose of a trip impacts the selection of accommodation. A strong correlation was observed between organizer expenditure and private expenditure, indicating that individual spending are more when the spending on organizing the trip are higher. However, no significant difference was observed in total expenditure across different accommodation types and purpose of the trip revealing that travelers tend to spend similar amounts regardless of their reason for travel or choice of accommodation. Although significant relationships were observed among certain variables, ANOVA could not be applied because the dataset was not able to hold on the normality assumption. In future, the dataset can be explored further to find more meaningful insights. The developed code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/SaadAhmedJamal/DataAnalysis RProgEnv.</description>

      <title>Auto.gov: Learning-based Governance for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an integral component of the blockchain ecosystem, enabling a range of financial activities through smart-contract-based protocols. Traditional DeFi governance typically involves manual parameter adjustments by protocol teams or token holder votes, and is thus prone to human bias and financial risks, undermining the system's integrity and security. While existing efforts aim to establish more adaptive parameter adjustment schemes, there remains a need for a governance model that is both more efficient and resilient to significant market manipulations. In this paper, we introduce "Auto.gov", a learning-based governance framework that employs a deep Q-network (DQN) reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to perform semi-automated, data-driven parameter adjustments. We create a DeFi environment with an encoded action-state space akin to the Aave lending protocol for simulation and testing purposes, where Auto.gov has demonstrated the capability to retain funds that would have otherwise been lost to price oracle attacks. In tests with real-world data, Auto.gov outperforms the benchmark approaches by at least 14% and the static baseline model by tenfold, in terms of the preset performance metric-protocol profitability. Overall, the comprehensive evaluations confirm that Auto.gov is more efficient and effective than traditional governance methods, thereby enhancing the security, profitability, and ultimately, the sustainability of DeFi protocols.</description>
