      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Grade Prediction in Froth Flotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, physics-informed neural network models are developed to predict the concentrate gold grade in froth flotation cells. Accurate prediction of concentrate grades is important for the automatic control and optimization of mineral processing. Both first-principles and data-driven machine learning methods have been used to model the flotation process. The complexity of models based on first-principles restricts their direct use, while purely data-driven models often fail in dynamic industrial environments, leading to poor generalization. To address these limitations, this study integrates classical mathematical models of froth flotation processes with conventional deep learning methods to construct physics-informed neural networks. These models demonstrated superior generalization and predictive performance compared to purely data-driven models, on simulated data from two flotation cells, in terms of mean squared error and mean relative error.</description>

      <title>Divergence-free neural operators for stress field modeling in polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of the current work is the development and comparison of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for surrogate modeling of the quasi-static mechanical response of polycrystalline materials. Three types of such FNOs are considered here: a physics-guided FNO (PgFNO), a physics-informed FNO (PiFNO), and a physics-encoded FNO (PeFNO). These are trained and compared with the help of stress field data from a reference model for heterogeneous elastic materials with a periodic grain microstructure. Whereas PgFNO training is based solely on these data, that of the PiFNO and PeFNO is in addition constrained by the requirement that stress fields satisfy mechanical equilibrium, i.e., be divergence-free. The difference between the PiFNO and PeFNO lies in how this constraint is taken into account; in the PiFNO, it is included in the loss function, whereas in the PeFNO, it is "encoded" in the operator architecture. In the current work, this encoding is based on a stress potential and Fourier transforms. As a result, only the training of the PiFNO is constrained by mechanical equilibrium; in contrast, mechanical equilibrium constrains both the training and output of the PeFNO. Due in particular to this, stress fields calculated by the trained PeFNO are significantly more accurate than those calculated by the trained PiFNO in the example cases considered.</description>

      <title>Continuum Damage Model for Hydrogen Embrittlement in Ferritic Steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement of metals and alloys, particularly steels, has been an important scientific and engineering challenge in the Oil and Gas industry for many years. It impacts the integrity and performance of a wide range of structures and equipment such as downhole tubulars and pipelines in sour service in the Upstream (U/S) and hydro-processing reactors in the Downstream (D/S). In addition, the rapidly growing interest in hydrogen as an energy carrier for fuel cells and mobility or as a clean fuel/heat source for hard to decarbonize industrial processes, draws attention to this key challenge of materials integrity in handling hydrogen. The fundamental understanding of failure mechanism(s) and the capability to model material behavior is important for managing the integrity and for repurposing existing infrastructure for transporting hydrogen as well as for extending the life of structures. To that extent, the present work develops a robust mathematical model to estimate the strength degradation and embrittlement due to hydrogen in steels. The model incorporates hydrogen affected constitutive response of material, within the framework of finite element method. The modified constitutive response is a Gurson plasticity based continuum damage model and incorporates two vital aspects of NVC failure theory. These key aspects are (i) hydrogen enhanced localized dislocation plasticity, and (ii) hydrogen enhanced vacancy stabilization forming nano-voids. The deformation and damage in the material is coupled with trap mediated hydrogen diffusion. Calibration of damage model parameters is performed for X65 commercial linepipe steel. Finally, capability of the damage model is demonstrated with numerical simulation of round bar tensile tests on X65 steel under hydrogen exposure. The numerical simulations are shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <title>PointEMRay: A Novel Efficient SBR Framework on Point Based Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid computation of electromagnetic (EM) fields across various scenarios has long been a challenge, primarily due to the need for precise geometric models. The emergence of point cloud data offers a potential solution to this issue. However, the lack of electromagnetic simulation algorithms optimized for point-based models remains a significant limitation. In this study, we propose PointEMRay, an innovative shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) framework designed explicitly for point-based geometries. To enable SBR on point clouds, we address two critical challenges: point-ray intersection (PRI) and multiple bounce computation (MBC). For PRI, we propose a screen-based method leveraging deep learning. Initially, we obtain coarse depth maps through ray tube tracing, which are then transformed by a neural network into dense depth maps, normal maps, and intersection masks, collectively referred to as geometric frame buffers (GFBs). For MBC, inspired by simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, we introduce a GFB-assisted approach. This involves aggregating GFBs from various observation angles and integrating them to recover the complete geometry. Subsequently, a ray tracing algorithm is applied to these GFBs to compute the scattering electromagnetic field. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of PointEMRay in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, including support for real-time simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to develop an SBR framework specifically tailored for point-based models.</description>

      <title>When Fire Attacks: How does Concrete Stand up to Heat ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fire is a process that generates both light and heat, posing a significant threat to life and infrastructure. Buildings and structures are neither inherently susceptible to fire nor completely fire-resistant; their vulnerability largely depends on the specific causes of the fire, which can stem from natural events or human-induced hazards. High temperatures in structures can lead to severe health risks for those directly affected, discomfort due to smoke, and compromised safety if the structure fails to meet safety standards. Elevated temperatures can also cause significant structural damage, becoming the primary cause of casualties, economic losses, and material damage. This study aims to investigate the thermal and structural behavior of concrete beams when exposed to extreme fire conditions. It examines the effects of different temperatures on plain and reinforced concrete (PCC and RCC, respectively) using finite element method (FEM) simulations. Additionally, the study explores the performance of various concrete grades under severe conditions. The analysis reveals that higher-grade concrete exhibits greater displacement, crack width, stress, and strain but has lower thermal conductivity compared to lower-grade concrete. These elevated temperatures can induce severe stresses in the concrete, leading to expansion, spalling, and the potential failure of the structure. Reinforced concrete, on the other hand, shows lower stress concentrations and minimal strain up to 250{\deg}C. These findings contribute to the existing knowledge and support the development of improved fire safety regulations and performance-based design methodologies.</description>

      <title>RGDA-DDI: Residual graph attention network and dual-attention based framework for drug-drug interaction prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction via computational approaches has significant importance for understanding the functions and co-prescriptions of multiple drugs. However, the existing silico DDI prediction methods either ignore the potential interactions among drug-drug pairs (DDPs), or fail to explicitly model and fuse the multi-scale drug feature representations for better prediction. In this study, we propose RGDA-DDI, a residual graph attention network (residual-GAT) and dual-attention based framework for drug-drug interaction prediction. A residual-GAT module is introduced to simultaneously learn multi-scale feature representations from drugs and DDPs. In addition, a dual-attention based feature fusion block is constructed to learn local joint interaction representations. A series of evaluation metrics demonstrate that the RGDA-DDI significantly improved DDI prediction performance on two public benchmark datasets, which provides a new insight into drug development.</description>

      <title>Shell topology optimization based on level set method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a level set-based method for optimizing shell structures with large design changes in shape and topology. Conventional shell optimization methods, whether parametric or nonparametric, often only allow limited design changes in shape. In the proposed method, the shell structure is defined as the isosurface of a level set function. The level set function is iteratively updated based on the shape sensitivity on the surface mesh. Therefore, the proposed method can represent an arbitrary manifold surface while dealing with topological changes, for example, from a spherical surface to a toroidal surface. We applied the proposed method to the mean compliance minimization problems of 3D shell structural designs for dome, bending plate and cantilever beam examples to demonstrate its efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Physics Preserving Neural Network Based Approach for Constitutive Modeling of Isotropic Fibrous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of the stress and material stiffness predictions is significantly improved for this neural network by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our neural network, we model the constitutive behavior of fibrous-type discrete network material. With Sobolev minimization, we obtain a normalized mean square error of 0.15% for the strain energy density, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness tensor. This machine-learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves were compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU-based supercomputer. The new approach maintained upward of 85% accuracy in stress up to 70% strain while reducing the computation cost by orders of magnitude.</description>
