      <title>Learning Complex Heterogeneous Multimodal Fake News via Social Latent Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the diversification of online social platforms, news dissemination has become increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and multimodal, making the fake news detection task more challenging and crucial. Previous works mainly focus on obtaining social relationships of news via retweets, limiting the accurate detection when real cascades are inaccessible. Given the proven assessment of the spreading influence of events, this paper proposes a method called HML (Complex Heterogeneous Multimodal Fake News Detection method via Latent Network Inference). Specifically, an improved social latent network inference strategy is designed to estimate the maximum likelihood of news influences under the same event. Meanwhile, a novel heterogeneous graph is built based on social attributes for multimodal news under different events. Further, to better aggregate the relationships among heterogeneous multimodal features, this paper proposes a self-supervised-based multimodal content learning strategy, to enhance, align, fuse and compare heterogeneous modal contents. Based above, a personalized heterogeneous graph representation learning is designed to classify fake news. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the SOTA in real social media news datasets.</description>

      <title>Movement- and Traffic-based User Identification in Commercial Virtual Reality Applications: Threats and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the unprecedented diffusion of virtual reality, the number of application scenarios is continuously growing. As commercial and gaming applications become pervasive, the need for the secure and convenient identification of users, often overlooked by the research in immersive media, is becoming more and more pressing. Networked scenarios such as Cloud gaming or cooperative virtual training and teleoperation require both a user-friendly and streamlined experience and user privacy and security. In this work, we investigate the possibility of identifying users from their movement patterns and data traffic traces while playing four commercial games, using a publicly available dataset. If, on the one hand, this paves the way for easy identification and automatic customization of the virtual reality content, it also represents a serious threat to users' privacy due to network analysis-based fingerprinting. Based on this, we analyze the threats and opportunities for virtual reality users' security and privacy.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Cross-Domain Knowledge Distillation for Cross-Dataset Text-to-Image Person Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video surveillance systems are crucial components for ensuring public safety and management in smart city. As a fundamental task in video surveillance, text-to-image person retrieval aims to retrieve the target person from an image gallery that best matches the given text description. Most existing text-to-image person retrieval methods are trained in a supervised manner that requires sufficient labeled data in the target domain. However, it is common in practice that only unlabeled data is available in the target domain due to the difficulty and cost of data annotation, which limits the generalization of existing methods in practical application scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method, termed Graph-Based Cross-Domain Knowledge Distillation (GCKD), to learn the cross-modal feature representation for text-to-image person retrieval in a cross-dataset scenario. The proposed GCKD method consists of two main components. Firstly, a graph-based multi-modal propagation module is designed to bridge the cross-domain correlation among the visual and textual samples. Secondly, a contrastive momentum knowledge distillation module is proposed to learn the cross-modal feature representation using the online knowledge distillation strategy. By jointly optimizing the two modules, the proposed method is able to achieve efficient performance for cross-dataset text-to-image person retrieval. acExtensive experiments on three publicly available text-to-image person retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GCKD method, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Audio-Language Models for Audio-Centric Tasks: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Language Models (ALMs), which are trained on audio-text data, focus on the processing, understanding, and reasoning of sounds. Unlike traditional supervised learning approaches learning from predefined labels, ALMs utilize natural language as a supervision signal, which is more suitable for describing complex real-world audio recordings. ALMs demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities and can be flexibly adapted to diverse downstream tasks. These strengths not only enhance the accuracy and generalization of audio processing tasks but also promote the development of models that more closely resemble human auditory perception and comprehension. Recent advances in ALMs have positioned them at the forefront of computer audition research, inspiring a surge of efforts to advance ALM technologies. Despite rapid progress in the field of ALMs, there is still a notable lack of systematic surveys that comprehensively organize and analyze developments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of ALMs with a focus on general audio tasks, aiming to fill this gap by providing a structured and holistic overview of ALMs. Specifically, we cover: (1) the background of computer audition and audio-language models; (2) the foundational aspects of ALMs, including prevalent network architectures, training objectives, and evaluation methods; (3) foundational pre-training and audio-language pre-training approaches; (4) task-specific fine-tuning, multi-task tuning and agent systems for downstream applications; (5) datasets and benchmarks; and (6) current challenges and future directions. Our review provides a clear technical roadmap for researchers to understand the development and future trends of existing technologies, offering valuable references for implementation in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Transfer from Memes to Videos: Addressing Data Scarcity in Hateful Video Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting hate speech in online content is essential to ensuring safer digital spaces. While significant progress has been made in text and meme modalities, video-based hate speech detection remains under-explored, hindered by a lack of annotated datasets and the high cost of video annotation. This gap is particularly problematic given the growing reliance on large models, which demand substantial amounts of training data. To address this challenge, we leverage meme datasets as both a substitution and an augmentation strategy for training hateful video detection models. Our approach introduces a human-assisted reannotation pipeline to align meme dataset labels with video datasets, ensuring consistency with minimal labeling effort. Using two state-of-the-art vision-language models, we demonstrate that meme data can substitute for video data in resource-scarce scenarios and augment video datasets to achieve further performance gains. Our results consistently outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks, showcasing the potential of cross-modal transfer learning for advancing hateful video detection.

      <title>On Parallelism in Music and Language: A Perspective from Symbol Emergence Systems based on Probabilistic Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music and language are structurally similar. Such structural similarity is often explained by generative processes. This paper describes the recent development of probabilistic generative models (PGMs) for language learning and symbol emergence in robotics. Symbol emergence in robotics aims to develop a robot that can adapt to real-world environments and human linguistic communications and acquire language from sensorimotor information alone (i.e., in an unsupervised manner). This is regarded as a constructive approach to symbol emergence systems. To this end, a series of PGMs have been developed, including those for simultaneous phoneme and word discovery, lexical acquisition, object and spatial concept formation, and the emergence of a symbol system. By extending the models, a symbol emergence system comprising a multi-agent system in which a symbol system emerges is revealed to be modeled using PGMs. In this model, symbol emergence can be regarded as collective predictive coding. This paper expands on this idea by combining the theory that ''emotion is based on the predictive coding of interoceptive signals'' and ''symbol emergence systems,'' and describes the possible hypothesis of the emergence of meaning in music.</description>

      <title>Implicit Location-Caption Alignment via Complementary Masking for Weakly-Supervised Dense Video Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Dense Video Captioning (WSDVC) aims to localize and describe all events of interest in a video without requiring annotations of event boundaries. This setting poses a great challenge in accurately locating the temporal location of event, as the relevant supervision is unavailable. Existing methods rely on explicit alignment constraints between event locations and captions, which involve complex event proposal procedures during both training and inference. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel implicit location-caption alignment paradigm by complementary masking, which simplifies the complex event proposal and localization process while maintaining effectiveness. Specifically, our model comprises two components: a dual-mode video captioning module and a mask generation module. The dual-mode video captioning module captures global event information and generates descriptive captions, while the mask generation module generates differentiable positive and negative masks for localizing the events. These masks enable the implicit alignment of event locations and captions by ensuring that captions generated from positively and negatively masked videos are complementary, thereby forming a complete video description. In this way, even under weak supervision, the event location and event caption can be aligned implicitly. Extensive experiments on the public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods and achieves competitive results compared to fully-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>PolySmart @ TRECVid 2024 Video Captioning (VTT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our methods and results for the Video-To-Text (VTT) task at TRECVid 2024, exploring the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT-Video in generating natural language descriptions for video content. We investigate the impact of fine-tuning VLMs on VTT datasets to enhance description accuracy, contextual relevance, and linguistic consistency. Our analysis reveals that fine-tuning substantially improves the model's ability to produce more detailed and domain-aligned text, bridging the gap between generic VLM tasks and the specialized needs of VTT. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model outperforms baseline VLMs across various evaluation metrics, underscoring the importance of domain-specific tuning for complex VTT tasks.</description>
