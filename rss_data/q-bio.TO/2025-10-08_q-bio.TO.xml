      <title>Robust Federated Anomaly Detection Using Dual-Signal Autoencoders: Application to Kidney Stone Identification in Ureteroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces Federated Adaptive Gain via Dual Signal Trust (FedAgain), a novel federated learning algorithm designed to enhance anomaly detection in medical imaging under decentralized and heterogeneous conditions. Focusing on the task of kidney stone classification, FedAgain addresses the common challenge of corrupted or low-quality client data in real-world clinical environments by implementing a dual-signal trust mechanism based on reconstruction error and model divergence. This mechanism enables the central server to dynamically down-weight updates from untrustworthy clients without accessing their raw data, thereby preserving both model integrity and data privacy. FedAgain employs deep convolutional autoencoders trained in two diverse kidney stone datasets and is evaluated in 16 types of endoscopy-specific corruption at five severity levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAgain effectively suppresses "expert forger" clients, enhances robustness to image corruptions, and offers a privacy-preserving solution for collaborative medical anomaly detection. Compared to traditional FedAvg, FedAgain achieves clear improvements in all 16 types of corruption, with precision gains of up to +14.49\% and F1 score improvements of up to +10.20\%, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in challenging imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neu-RadBERT for Enhanced Diagnosis of Brain Injuries and Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: We sought to develop a classification algorithm to extract diagnoses from free-text radiology reports of brain imaging performed in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: We developed and fine-tuned Neu-RadBERT, a BERT-based model, to classify unstructured radiology reports. We extracted all the brain imaging reports (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) from MIMIC-IV database, performed in patients with ARF. Initial manual labelling was performed on a subset of reports for various brain abnormalities, followed by fine-tuning Neu-RadBERT using three strategies: 1) baseline RadBERT, 2) Neu-RadBERT with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pretraining, and 3) Neu-RadBERT with MLM pretraining and oversampling to address data skewness. We compared the performance of this model to Llama-2-13B, an autoregressive LLM. Results: The Neu-RadBERT model, particularly with oversampling, demonstrated significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy compared to baseline RadBERT for brain abnormalities, achieving up to 98.0% accuracy for acute brain injuries. Llama-2-13B exhibited relatively lower performance, peaking at 67.5% binary classification accuracy. This result highlights potential limitations of current autoregressive LLMs for this specific classification task, though it remains possible that larger models or further fine-tuning could improve performance. Conclusion: Neu-RadBERT, enhanced through target domain pretraining and oversampling techniques, offered a robust tool for accurate and reliable diagnosis of neurological conditions from radiology reports. This study underscores the potential of transformer-based NLP models in automatically extracting diagnoses from free text reports with potential applications to both research and patient care.</description>

      <title>A model of the human cornea as a hydrated, fluid-saturated medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new model of the human corneal stroma, regarded as a fluid-saturated continuum, able to describe surface flattening and thickness thinning observed in several pathological conditions. In contrast with more common approaches that describe the human cornea as a quasi-incompressible hyperelastic medium, eventually including micro-structured anisotropy and heterogeneity, here we focus on the multi-phase nature of the tissue, where the content of water reaches about 78\% in weight. The study is motivated by the fact that, although purely mechanical continuum models have been demonstrated to be satisfactory and accurate at predicting physiological behaviors, they have not been able to capture the geometrical features of tissue degeneration clearly associated to a reduction of the fluid content in the stroma, such thinning and loss of curvature. Here, we model the cornea as a fully saturated mixture of a solid phase and a fluid phase, in principle without restricting the formulation to specific assumptions on the actual inhomogeneous nature of both phases. The focus of the study is to understand whether a multiphysics model is capable of explaining, in terms of fluid flux imbalance, such as ectasia and keratoconus. As a first attempt in this direction, we make simple isotropic constitutive assumptions for both phases.</description>

      <title>Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative, this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.</description>

      <title>Advancing glaucoma research with multiphysics continuum mechanics modelling: Opportunities and open challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review examines the emerging role of mechanistic mathematical models based on continuum mechanics to address current challenges in glaucoma research. At present, the advent of Artificial Intelligence and data-based models have resulted in significant progress in drug candidate screening, target identification and delivery optimization for glaucoma treatment. Physics-based models on the other hand offer mechanistic insight by modelling fundamental physical knowledge. Mechanistic models, and specifically those based on continuum mechanics, have the potential to contribute to a better understanding of glaucoma through the description of intraocular fluid dynamics, mass and heat transfer and other basic physical phenomena. So far, these models have expanded our understanding of ocular fluid dynamics, including descriptions of fluid flow profiles within the anterior chamber of the eye under glaucomatous conditions. With the ongoing development of multiphysics modelling frameworks, there is increasing potential to apply these tools to a wide range of current challenges within the field of glaucoma research. These challenges include glaucoma drainage devices, minimally invasive surgical procedures, therapeutic contact lenses, laser-based interventions like peripheral iridotomy, and the design and optimization of biodegradable drug-releasing intracameral implants, which support patient-specific strategies for glaucoma diagnosis and treatment</description>
