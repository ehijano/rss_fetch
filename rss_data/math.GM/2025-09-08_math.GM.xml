      <title>A symmetry approach to number tricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the classical "1089-number trick", which states that a certain combination of addition, subtraction and swapping the digits of a three-digit number will always output 1089. More precisely, we show that any pair of zero divisors $f\circ g=0$ in the group ring ${\mathbb Z}[\Sigma_n]$ on the n-th symmetric group gives rise to a partition of the set of n-digit numbers into subsets $U_{\mathbf c}$ defined by linear inequalities, such that the zero divisors act constantly on each $U_{\mathbf c}$ and hence define a number trick.</description>

      <title>On Taylor-like Estimates for Chebyshev Series Approximations of $e^x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polynomial series approximations are a central theme in approximation theory due to their utility in an abundance of numerical applications. The two types of series, which are featured most prominently, are Taylor series expansions and expansions derived based on families of $L^{2}-$orthogonal polynomials on bounded intervals. Traditionally, however, the properties of these series are studied in an isolated manner and most results on the $L^{2}-$based approximations are restricted to the interval of approximation. In many applications, theoretical guarantees require global estimates. Since these often follow trivially from Taylor's remainder theorem, Taylor's series is often favored in these applications. Its suboptimal numerical performance on compact intervals, however, ultimately results in such numerical algorithms being suboptimal. We show that "Taylor-like" bounds valid outside of the interval of approximation may be derived for the important case of $e^{x}$ and Chebyshev polynomials on $[-1,1]$ and provide links to substantial numerical applications.</description>
