      <title>Toward Automatic Group Membership Annotation for Group Fairness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing research attention on fairness in information retrieval systems, more and more fairness-aware algorithms have been proposed to ensure fairness for a sustainable and healthy retrieval ecosystem. However, as the most adopted measurement of fairness-aware algorithms, group fairness evaluation metrics, require group membership information that needs massive human annotations and is barely available for general information retrieval datasets. This data sparsity significantly impedes the development of fairness-aware information retrieval studies. Hence, a practical, scalable, low-cost group membership annotation method is needed to assist or replace human annotations. This study explored how to leverage language models to automatically annotate group membership for group fairness evaluations, focusing on annotation accuracy and its impact. Our experimental results show that BERT-based models outperformed state-of-the-art large language models, including GPT and Mistral, achieving promising annotation accuracy with minimal supervision in recent fair-ranking datasets. Our impact-oriented evaluations reveal that minimal annotation error will not degrade the effectiveness and robustness of group fairness evaluation. The proposed annotation method reduces tremendous human efforts and expands the frontier of fairness-aware studies to more datasets.</description>

      <title>A Neural Matrix Decomposition Recommender System Model based on the Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems have become an important solution to information search problems. This article proposes a neural matrix factorization recommendation system model based on the multimodal large language model called BoNMF. This model combines BoBERTa's powerful capabilities in natural language processing, ViT in computer in vision, and neural matrix decomposition technology. By capturing the potential characteristics of users and items, and after interacting with a low-dimensional matrix composed of user and item IDs, the neural network outputs the results. recommend. Cold start and ablation experimental results show that the BoNMF model exhibits excellent performance on large public data sets and significantly improves the accuracy of recommendations.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Analysis of Variable-Length WiFi CSI Signals for Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID), as a crucial technology in the field of security, plays an important role in security detection and people counting. Current security and monitoring systems largely rely on visual information, which may infringe on personal privacy and be susceptible to interference from pedestrian appearances and clothing in certain scenarios. Meanwhile, the widespread use of routers offers new possibilities for ReID. This letter introduces a method using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI), leveraging the multipath propagation characteristics of WiFi signals as a basis for distinguishing different pedestrian features. We propose a two-stream network structure capable of processing variable-length data, which analyzes the amplitude in the time domain and the phase in the frequency domain of WiFi signals, fuses time-frequency information through continuous lateral connections, and employs advanced objective functions for representation and metric learning. Tested on a dataset collected in the real world, our method achieves 93.68% mAP and 98.13% Rank-1.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Dataset Creation for Federated~Learning with DICOM Structured Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Federated training is often hindered by heterogeneous datasets due to divergent data storage options, inconsistent naming schemes, varied annotation procedures, and disparities in label quality. This is particularly evident in the emerging multi-modal learning paradigms, where dataset harmonization including a uniform data representation and filtering options are of paramount importance.
  Methods: DICOM structured reports enable the standardized linkage of arbitrary information beyond the imaging domain and can be used within Python deep learning pipelines with highdicom. Building on this, we developed an open platform for data integration and interactive filtering capabilities that simplifies the process of assembling multi-modal datasets.
  Results: In this study, we extend our prior work by showing its applicability to more and divergent data types, as well as streamlining datasets for federated training within an established consortium of eight university hospitals in Germany. We prove its concurrent filtering ability by creating harmonized multi-modal datasets across all locations for predicting the outcome after minimally invasive heart valve replacement. The data includes DICOM data (i.e. computed tomography images, electrocardiography scans) as well as annotations (i.e. calcification segmentations, pointsets and pacemaker dependency), and metadata (i.e. prosthesis and diagnoses).
  Conclusion: Structured reports bridge the traditional gap between imaging systems and information systems. Utilizing the inherent DICOM reference system arbitrary data types can be queried concurrently to create meaningful cohorts for clinical studies. The graphical interface as well as example structured report templates will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Look Into News Avoidance Through AWRS: An Avoidance-Aware Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, journalists have expressed concerns about the increasing trend of news article avoidance, especially within specific domains. This issue has been exacerbated by the rise of recommender systems. Our research indicates that recommender systems should consider avoidance as a fundamental factor. We argue that news articles can be characterized by three principal elements: exposure, relevance, and avoidance, all of which are closely interconnected. To address these challenges, we introduce AWRS, an Avoidance-Aware Recommender System. This framework incorporates avoidance awareness when recommending news, based on the premise that news article avoidance conveys significant information about user preferences. Evaluation results on three news datasets in different languages (English, Norwegian, and Japanese) demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Movie Recommendation with Poster Attention via Multi-modal Transformer Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained models learn general representations from large datsets which can be fine-turned for specific tasks to significantly reduce training time. Pre-trained models like generative pretrained transformers (GPT), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), vision transfomers (ViT) have become a cornerstone of current research in machine learning. This study proposes a multi-modal movie recommendation system by extract features of the well designed posters for each movie and the narrative text description of the movie. This system uses the BERT model to extract the information of text modality, the ViT model applied to extract the information of poster/image modality, and the Transformer architecture for feature fusion of all modalities to predict users' preference. The integration of pre-trained foundational models with some smaller data sets in downstream applications capture multi-modal content features in a more comprehensive manner, thereby providing more accurate recommendations. The efficiency of the proof-of-concept model is verified by the standard benchmark problem the MovieLens 100K and 1M datasets. The prediction accuracy of user ratings is enhanced in comparison to the baseline algorithm, thereby demonstrating the potential of this cross-modal algorithm to be applied for movie or video recommendation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with generating reliable outputs due to outdated knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models address this by enhancing LLMs with external knowledge, but often fail to personalize the retrieval process. This paper introduces PersonaRAG, a novel framework incorporating user-centric agents to adapt retrieval and generation based on real-time user data and interactions. Evaluated across various question answering datasets, PersonaRAG demonstrates superiority over baseline models, providing tailored answers to user needs. The results suggest promising directions for user-adapted information retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Bag-of-Words Model: An Efficient and Interpretable Relevance Architecture for Chinese E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text relevance or text matching of query and product is an essential technique for the e-commerce search system to ensure that the displayed products can match the intent of the query. Many studies focus on improving the performance of the relevance model in search system. Recently, pre-trained language models like BERT have achieved promising performance on the text relevance task. While these models perform well on the offline test dataset, there are still obstacles to deploy the pre-trained language model to the online system as their high latency. The two-tower model is extensively employed in industrial scenarios, owing to its ability to harmonize performance with computational efficiency. Regrettably, such models present an opaque ``black box'' nature, which prevents developers from making special optimizations. In this paper, we raise deep Bag-of-Words (DeepBoW) model, an efficient and interpretable relevance architecture for Chinese e-commerce. Our approach proposes to encode the query and the product into the sparse BoW representation, which is a set of word-weight pairs. The weight means the important or the relevant score between the corresponding word and the raw text. The relevance score is measured by the accumulation of the matched word between the sparse BoW representation of the query and the product. Compared to popular dense distributed representation that usually suffers from the drawback of black-box, the most advantage of the proposed representation model is highly explainable and interventionable, which is a superior advantage to the deployment and operation of online search engines. Moreover, the online efficiency of the proposed model is even better than the most efficient inner product form of dense representation ...</description>

      <title>Are They the Same Picture? Adapting Concept Bottleneck Models for Human-AI Collaboration in Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image retrieval plays a pivotal role in applications from wildlife conservation to healthcare, for finding individual animals or relevant images to aid diagnosis. Although deep learning techniques for image retrieval have advanced significantly, their imperfect real-world performance often necessitates including human expertise. Human-in-the-loop approaches typically rely on humans completing the task independently and then combining their opinions with an AI model in various ways, as these models offer very little interpretability or \textit{correctability}. To allow humans to intervene in the AI model instead, thereby saving human time and effort, we adapt the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and propose \texttt{CHAIR}. \texttt{CHAIR} (a) enables humans to correct intermediate concepts, which helps \textit{improve} embeddings generated, and (b) allows for flexible levels of intervention that accommodate varying levels of human expertise for better retrieval. To show the efficacy of \texttt{CHAIR}, we demonstrate that our method performs better than similar models on image retrieval metrics without any external intervention. Furthermore, we also showcase how human intervention helps further improve retrieval performance, thereby achieving human-AI complementarity.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Guided Response for Security Operation Centers with Microsoft Copilot for Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security operation centers contend with a constant stream of security incidents, ranging from straightforward to highly complex. To address this, we developed Copilot Guided Response (CGR), an industry-scale ML architecture that guides security analysts across three key tasks -- (1) investigation, providing essential historical context by identifying similar incidents; (2) triaging to ascertain the nature of the incident -- whether it is a true positive, false positive, or benign positive; and (3) remediation, recommending tailored containment actions. CGR is integrated into the Microsoft Defender XDR product and deployed worldwide, generating millions of recommendations across thousands of customers. Our extensive evaluation, incorporating internal evaluation, collaboration with security experts, and customer feedback, demonstrates that CGR delivers high-quality recommendations across all three tasks. We provide a comprehensive overview of the CGR architecture, setting a precedent as the first cybersecurity company to openly discuss these capabilities in such depth. Additionally, we GUIDE, the largest public collection of real-world security incidents, spanning 13M evidences across 1M annotated incidents. By enabling researchers and practitioners to conduct research on real-world data, GUIDE advances the state of cybersecurity and supports the development of next-generation machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>Distinct citation distributions complicate research evaluations. A single indicator that universally reveals research efficiency cannot be formulated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Analyze the diversity of citation distributions to publications in different research topics to investigate the accuracy of size-independent, rank-based indicators. Top percentile-based indicators are the most common indicators of this type, and the evaluations of Japan are the most evident misjudgments. Design/methodology/approach: The distributions of citations to publications from countries and in journals in several research topics were analyzed along with the corresponding global publications using histograms with logarithmic binning, double rank plots, and normal probability plots of log-transformed numbers of citations. Findings: Size-independent, top percentile-based indicators are accurate when the global ranks of local publications fit a power law, but deviations in the least cited papers are frequent in countries and occur in all journals with high impact factors. In these cases, a single indicator is misleading. Comparisons of proportions of uncited papers are the best way to predict these deviations. Research limitations: The study is fundamentally analytical; its results describe mathematical facts that are self-evident. Practical implications: Respectable institutions, such as the OECD, European Commission, US National Science Board, and others, produce research country rankings and individual evaluations using size-independent percentile indicators that are misleading in many countries. These misleading evaluations should be discontinued because they cause confusion among research policymakers and lead to incorrect research policies. Originality/value: Studies linking the lower tail of citation distribution, including uncited papers, to percentile research indicators have not been performed previously. The present results demonstrate that studies of this type are necessary to find reliable procedures for research assessments.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Immersive Assistance for Interactive Task Execution in Industrial Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many industrial sectors rely on well-trained employees that are able to operate complex machinery. In this work, we demonstrate an AI-powered immersive assistance system that supports users in performing complex tasks in industrial environments. Specifically, our system leverages a VR environment that resembles a juice mixer setup. This digital twin of a physical setup simulates complex industrial machinery used to mix preparations or liquids (e.g., similar to the pharmaceutical industry) and includes various containers, sensors, pumps, and flow controllers. This setup demonstrates our system's capabilities in a controlled environment while acting as a proof-of-concept for broader industrial applications. The core components of our multimodal AI assistant are a large language model and a speech-to-text model that process a video and audio recording of an expert performing the task in a VR environment. The video and speech input extracted from the expert's video enables it to provide step-by-step guidance to support users in executing complex tasks. This demonstration showcases the potential of our AI-powered assistant to reduce cognitive load, increase productivity, and enhance safety in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Context Embeddings for Efficient Answer Generation in RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows overcoming the limited knowledge of LLMs by extending the input with external information. As a consequence, the contextual inputs to the model become much longer which slows down decoding time directly translating to the time a user has to wait for an answer. We address this challenge by presenting COCOM, an effective context compression method, reducing long contexts to only a handful of Context Embeddings speeding up the generation time by a large margin. Our method allows for different compression rates trading off decoding time for answer quality. Compared to earlier methods, COCOM allows for handling multiple contexts more effectively, significantly reducing decoding time for long inputs. Our method demonstrates a speed-up of up to 5.69 $\times$ while achieving higher performance compared to existing efficient context compression methods.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Entity-Level Hallucination in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized how users access information, shifting from traditional search engines to direct question-and-answer interactions with LLMs. However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has revealed a significant challenge known as hallucination, wherein LLMs generate coherent yet factually inaccurate responses. This hallucination phenomenon has led to users' distrust in information retrieval systems based on LLMs. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes Dynamic Retrieval Augmentation based on hallucination Detection (DRAD) as a novel method to detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLMs. DRAD improves upon traditional retrieval augmentation by dynamically adapting the retrieval process based on real-time hallucination detection. It features two main components: Real-time Hallucination Detection (RHD) for identifying potential hallucinations without external models, and Self-correction based on External Knowledge (SEK) for correcting these errors using external knowledge. Experiment results show that DRAD demonstrates superior performance in both detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs. All of our code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/oneal2000/EntityHallucination.</description>

      <title>ADMM Based Semi-Structured Pattern Pruning Framework For Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NLP(natural language processsing) has achieved great success through the transformer model.However, the model has hundreds of millions or billions parameters,which is huge burden for its deployment on personal computer or small scale of server.To deal with it, we either make the model's weight matrix relatively sparser, or compress attention layer. Pattern pruning ,one of the most important pruning methods, permits selecting fixed number of parameters in each divided pattern block and prunes it. However, the effect of pattern pruning is strictly limited by the sparsity within a region of weights in each layer. In this paper,we first introduced Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM) based pattern pruning framework to reshape the distribution of activation map. Specifically, we propose to formulate the pattern pruning on transformer as a constrained optimization and use ADMM to optimize the problem. In this way, the initial dense feature maps is transformed to rather regionally sparsified ones.Therefore, we can then achieve higher compression ratio with better performance based on pattern pruning method. Additionally, this paper provides a theoretical derivations of the ADMM with local sparsity. Finally, we also extend the proposed ADMM based framework on quantization to demonstrate its generalization and use SR-STE to avoid gradient vanishing problem. We conduct extensive experiments on classification tasks over GLUE datasets. Significantly, we achieve 50% percent compression ratio while maintaining overall score 80.1 on GLUE datasets.</description>

Abstract: Ranking is a ubiquitous method for focusing the attention of human evaluators on a manageable subset of options. Its use as part of human decision-making processes ranges from surfacing potentially relevant products on an e-commerce site to prioritizing college applications for human review. While ranking can make human evaluation more effective by focusing attention on the most promising options, we argue that it can introduce unfairness if the uncertainty of the underlying relevance model differs between groups of options. Unfortunately, such disparity in uncertainty appears widespread, often to the detriment of minority groups for which relevance estimates can have higher uncertainty due to a lack of data or appropriate features. To address this fairness issue, we propose Equal-Opportunity Ranking (EOR) as a new fairness criterion for ranking and show that it corresponds to a group-wise fair lottery among the relevant options even in the presence of disparate uncertainty. EOR optimizes for an even cost burden on all groups, unlike the conventional Probability Ranking Principle, and is fundamentally different from existing notions of fairness in rankings, such as demographic parity and proportional Rooney rule constraints that are motivated by proportional representation relative to group size. To make EOR ranking practical, we present an efficient algorithm for computing it in time $O(n \log(n))$ and prove its close approximation guarantee to the globally optimal solution. In a comprehensive empirical evaluation on synthetic data, a US Census dataset, and a real-world audit of Amazon search queries, we find that the algorithm reliably guarantees EOR fairness while providing effective rankings.</description>
