      <title>Error estimates for a surface finite element method for anisotropic mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error estimates are proved for an evolving surface finite element semi-discretization for anisotropic mean curvature flow of closed surfaces. For the geometric surface flow, a system coupling the anisotropic evolution law to parabolic evolution equations for the surface normal and normal velocity is derived, which then serve as the basis for the proposed numerical method. The algorithm for anisotropic mean curvature flow is proved to be convergent in the $H^1$-norm with optimal-order for finite elements of degree at least two. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate and complement our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Error estimates of linear decoupled structure-preserving incremental viscosity splitting methods for the Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose first- and second-order time discretization schemes for the coupled Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes model, leveraging the incremental viscosity splitting (IVS) method. The schemes combine the scalar auxiliary variable method and the zero-energy-contribution approach, resulting in a linear, decoupled numerical framework. At each time step, they only require to solve a sequence of constant-coefficient equations, along with a linear equation with one unknown, making the algorithms computationally efficient and easy to implement. In addition, the proposed schemes are proven to be uniquely solvable, mass-conserving, and unconditional energy dissipation. Most importantly, leveraging the mathematical induction method and the regularity properties of the Stokes equation, we perform a rigorous error analysis for the first-order scheme in multiple space dimensions, establishing an unconditional and optimal convergence rate for all relevant variables under different norms. A user-defined, time-dependent parameter plays an important role in the error analysis of the proposed structure-preserving IVS methods. Ample numerical examples are carried out to verify the theoretical findings and to demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Worsey-Farin splines with applications to solution transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work primarily focuses on providing full implementation details for Worsey-Farin (WF) spline interpolation over tetrahedral elements. While this spline space is not new and the theory has been covered in other works, there is a lack of explicit and comprehensive implementation details, which we hope to provide. In this paper, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the WF-spline space through a simple target application: solution transfer. Moreover, we derive an error estimate for the WF spline-based, solution transfer process. We conduct numerical experiments quantifying the conservative nature and order of accuracy of the transfer process, and we present a qualitative evaluation of the visualization properties of the smoothed solution. Additionally, in our study of conservation, we demonstrate how adaptive numerical quadrature rules on the tetrahedron used in conjunction with global L2-projection can improve the conservation of the solution transfer process.</description>

      <title>Finite element conformal complexes in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) framework to the construction of finite element conformal Hessian complexes and conformal elasticity complexes in three dimensions involving conformal tensors (i.e., symmetric and traceless tensors). These complexes incorporate higher-order differential operators, including the linearized Cotton-York operator, and require conformal tensor spaces with nontrivial smoothness and trace conditions. A novel application of the discrete BGG framework, combined with the geometric decomposition of bubble spaces and a reduction operation, to local bubble finite element complexes is introduced. This yields simpler and more tractable constructions than global BGG-based approaches, and leads to the bubble conformal complexes. Building on these bubble conformal complexes and the associated face bubble complexes, finite element conformal Hessian complexes and conformal elasticity complexes with varying degrees of smoothness are systematically developed. The resulting complexes support stable and structure-preserving numerical methods for applications in relativity, Cosserat elasticity, and fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>A linear, mass-conserving, multi-time-step compact block-centered finite difference method for incompressible miscible displacement problem in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a two-dimensional incompressible miscible displacement model is considered, and a novel decoupled and linearized high-order finite difference scheme is developed, by utilizing the multi-time-step strategy to treat the different time evolutions of concentration and velocity/pressure, and the compact block-centered finite difference approximation for spatial discretization. We show that the scheme is mass-conserving, and has second-order temporal accuracy and fourth-order spatial accuracy for the concentration, the velocity and the pressure simultaneously. The existence and uniqueness of the developed scheme under a rough time-step condition is also proved following the convergence results. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm the theoretical conclusions. Besides, some 'real' simulations are also tested to show good performance of the proposed scheme, in particular, the viscous fingering phenomenon is verified.</description>

      <title>Wiener chaos expansion for stochastic Maxwell equations driven by Wiener process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel and efficient algorithm based on the Wiener chaos expansion is proposed for the stochastic Maxwell equations driven by Wiener process. The proposed algorithm can reduce the original stochastic system to the deterministic case and separate the randomness in the computation. Therefore, it can yield a significant improvement of efficiency and lead to less computational errors compared to the Monte Carlo method, since the statistics of the solution can be solved directly without repeating over many realizations. In particular, the proposed algorithm could inherit the multi-symplecticity. Numerical experiments are dedicated to performing the efficiency and accuracy of the Wiener chaos expansion algorithm.</description>

      <title>PGD-based local surrogate models via overlapping domain decomposition: a computational comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient strategy to construct physics-based local surrogate models for parametric linear elliptic problems is presented. The method relies on proper generalized decomposition (PGD) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and on an overlapping domain decomposition (DD) strategy to decouple the spatial degrees of freedom. In the offline phase, the local surrogate model is computed in a non-intrusive way, exploiting the linearity of the operator and imposing arbitrary Dirichlet conditions, independently at each node of the interface, by means of the traces of the finite element functions employed for the discretization inside the subdomain. This leads to parametric subproblems with reduced dimensionality, significantly decreasing the complexity of the involved computations and achieving speed-ups up to 100 times with respect to a previously proposed DD-PGD algorithm that required clustering the interface nodes. A fully algebraic alternating Schwarz method is then formulated to couple the subdomains in the online phase, leveraging the real-time (less than half a second) evaluation capabilities of the computed local surrogate models, that do not require the solution of any additional low-dimensional problems. A computational comparison of different PGD-based local surrogate models is presented using a set of numerical benchmarks to showcase the superior performance of the proposed methodology, both in the offline and in the online phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of slowly converging series and infinite integrals is a key challenge in numerical analysis and computational mathematics. In their influential 1981 paper, the author and Avram Sidi introduced two effective nonlinear transformations, the d-transformation for series and the D-transformation for infinite integrals, aimed at speeding up their convergence. This review summarizes, contextualizes, and evaluates their contributions, highlighting the mathematical basis, practical significance, and legacy of their work.</description>

      <title>Extended Interface Physics-Informed Neural Networks Method for Moving Interface Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful class of mesh-free numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly those involving complex geometries. In this work, we present an innovative Extended Interface Physics-Informed Neural Network (XI-PINN) framework specifically designed to solve parabolic moving interface problems. The proposed approach incorporates a level set function to characterize the interface, which can be obtained either directly or through a neural network solution. We conduct a rigorous a priori error analysis for the XI-PINN method, providing error bounds for the approximation. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we further demonstrate that XI-PINN achieves a faster training convergence rate compared to conventional PINN approaches. The method's versatility is further demonstrated by its application to the Oseen equations. We perform comprehensive numerical experiments to validate the efficacy, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis for computing multiple solutions of semilinear elliptic problems by high-index saddle dynamics: Part I--Index-1 case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a numerical analysis of computing transition states of semilinear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) via the high-index saddle dynamics at the index-1 case, or equivalently, the gentlest ascent dynamics. To establish clear connections between saddle dynamics and numerical methods of PDEs, as well as improving their compatibility, we first propose the continuous-in-space formulation of saddle dynamics for semilinear elliptic problems. This formulation yields a parabolic system that converges to saddle points. We then analyze the well-posedness, $H^1$ stability and error estimates of semi- and fully-discrete finite element schemes. Significant efforts are devoted to addressing the coupling, gradient nonlinearity, nonlocality of the proposed parabolic system, and the impacts of retraction due to the norm constraint. The error estimate results demonstrate the accuracy and index-preservation of the discrete schemes.</description>

      <title>A Randomized GMsFEM with Data-Driven Predictors for Parametric Flow Problems in Multiscale Heterogeneous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a randomized generalized multiscale finite element method (Randomized GMsFEM) for flow problems with parameterized inputs and high-contrast heterogeneous media. The method employs a data-driven predictor to construct multiscale basis functions in two stages: offline and online. In the offline stage, a snapshot space is generated via spectral decompositions, and a reduced matrix is obtained using SVD to predict eigenfunctions. In the online stage, these eigenfunctions are evaluated for new parameter realizations to construct the multiscale space. Furthermore, our approach addresses the complexity of multiple permeability fields with random inputs and multiple multiscale information, providing accurate and efficient approximations. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for our Randomized GMsFEM. Finally, we present extensive numerical examples, demonstrating its superior performance compared to the traditional GMsFEM.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving entropy-regularized stochastic control problems. The method iteratively alternates between soft policy evaluation and improvement using automatic differentiation and neural approximation, without relying on spatial discretization. We present a detailed $L^2$ error analysis that decomposes the total approximation error into three sources: iteration error, policy network error, and PDE residual error. The proposed algorithm is validated with a range of challenging control tasks, including high-dimensional linear-quadratic regulation in 5D and 10D, as well as nonlinear systems such as pendulum and cartpole problems. Numerical results confirm the scalability, accuracy, and robustness of our approach across both linear and nonlinear benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On the normalization of trigonometric and hyperbolic B-splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigonometric and hyperbolic B-splines can be computed via recurrence relations analogous to the classical polynomial B-splines. However, in their original formulation, these two types of B-splines do not form a partition of unity and consequently do not admit the notion of control polygons with the convex hull property for design purposes. In this paper, we look into explicit expressions for their normalization and provide a recursive algorithm to compute the corresponding normalization weights. As example application, we consider the exact representation of a circle in terms of $C^{2n-1}$ trigonometric B-splines of order $m=2n+1\geq3$, with a variable number of control points. We also illustrate the approximation power of trigonometric and hyperbolic splines.</description>

      <title>Non-self-adjoint sixth-order eigenvalue problems arising from clamped elastic thin films on closed domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth-order boundary value problems (BVPs) arise in thin-film flows with a surface that has elastic bending resistance. We consider the case in which the elastic interface is clamped at the lateral walls of a closed trough and thus encloses a finite amount of fluid. For a slender film undergoing infinitesimal deformations, the displacement of the elastic surface from its initial equilibrium position obeys a sixth-order (in space) initial boundary value problem (IBVP). To solve this IBVP, we construct a set of odd and even eigenfunctions that intrinsically satisfy the boundary conditions (BCs) of the original IBVP. These eigenfunctions are the solutions of a non-self-adjoint sixth-order eigenvalue problem (EVP). To use the eigenfunctions for series expansions, we also construct and solve the adjoint EVP, leading to another set of even and odd eigenfunctions, which are orthogonal to the original set (biorthogonal). The eigenvalues of the adjoint EVP are the same as those of the original EVP, and we find accurate asymptotic formulas for them. Next, employing the biorthogonal sets of eigenfunctions, a Petrov--Galerkin spectral method for sixth-order problems is proposed, which can also handle lower-order terms in the IBVP. The proposed method is tested on two model sixth-order BVPs, which admit exact solutions. We explicitly derive all the necessary formulas for expanding the quantities that appear in the model problems into the set(s) of eigenfunctions. For both model problems, we find that the approximate Petrov--Galerkin spectral solution is in excellent agreement with the exact solution. The convergence rate of the spectral series is rapid, exceeding the expected sixth-order algebraic rate.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Optimal SOR for a Class of Consistently Ordered 2-Cyclic Matrices with Complex Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic rates of convergence of optimal SOR applied to linear systems with consistently ordered 2-cyclic matrices have been extensively studied in the case where the Jacobi eigenvalues are are real and contained in an interval centered at the origin. It is well known that as the rightmost endpoint of the interval approaches $1$ from below, optimal SOR converges an order of magnitude faster than Jacobi. We generalize this to the situation where the Jacobi spectrum is contained in a line segment in the complex plane that is symmetric about the origin. This is an important class of linear systems, which arise often in various physical applications; complex-shifted linear systems are included in this family. Optimal relaxation parameters are known in this case, but a detailed convergence analysis does not seem to exist in the literature. Using techniques of complex analysis, we derive convergence rates, finding that in the complex case they are affected not only by the distance to 1 of the right-hand endpoint of the line segment as in the real case, but also by its phase.</description>

      <title>The Weak Galerkin and Crouzeix-Raviart element method for elastic eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce an abstract framework to solve the eigenvalue problem by weak Galerkin (WG) method. By the application of the framework, WG method is proved to be locking-free and gives asymptotic lower bounds for the elastic eigenvalue problem. Also, we analyze the lower bound property for Crouzeix-Raviart (CR) element as an extensional work. In the end, we present some numerical experiments to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a two-gird skill to accelerate the weak Galerkin method. By the proper use of parameters, the two-grid weak Galerkin method not only doubles the convergence rate, but also maintains the asymptotic lower bounds property of the weak Galerkin (WG) method. Moreover, we propose an enriched Crouzeix-Raviart (ECR) scheme, which can also provide lower bounds for the linear elastic eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Crouzeix-Raviart finite elements for the first eigenpair of $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze an adaptive Crouzeix-Raviart finite element method for computing the first Dirichlet eigenpair of the $p$-Laplacian problem. We prove that the sequence of error estimators produced by the adaptive algorithm has a vanishing limit and that, starting from a fine initial mesh, the relevant sequence of approximate eigenvalues converges to the first eigenvalue and the distance in a mesh-dependent broken norm between discrete eigenfunctions and the set composed of relevant continuous eigenfunctions also tends to zero. The analysis hinges on establishing a compactness property for Crouzeix-Raviart finite elements over a sequence of adaptively generated meshes, which represents key theoretical challenges and novelties. We present numerical results to illustrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fully implicit timestepping methods for the rotating shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</description>

      <title>Numerical Homogenization of Landau-Lifshitz Equation with Rough Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a numerical homogenization approach for the fully nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz equation with rough coefficients, including non-periodicity and nonseparable scales. Direct numerical resolution of such multiscale problems on fine meshes incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient coarse scale approximation through localized basis functions derived from energy minimization within the Generalized Rough Polyharmonic Splines (GRPS) framework. These basis functions preserve critical multiscale features while operating on a computationally tractable coarse mesh. The nonlinear, vectorial, and non-symmetric nature of the Landau-Lifshitz equation necessitates careful design of variational formulations for basis construction. We introduce several such formulations, each tailored to specific structural aspects of the problem. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant computational savings without compromising accuracy, offering a robust framework for simulating multiscale magnetic systems with complex microstructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and analyse a new numerical method to solve ODE system based on the structural method. We compute approximations of solutions together with its derivatives up to order $K$ by solving an entire block corresponding to $R$ time steps. We build the physical relations that connect the function and derivative approximations at each time step by using the ODE and its derivatives, and develop the structural equations that establish linear relations between the function and its derivative over the whole block of $R$ times steps. The non-linear system is solved and provide very accurate approximations with nice spectral resolution properties.</description>

      <title>Analysis and virtual element discretisation of a Stokes/Biot--Kirchhoff bulk--surface model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a coupled 3D-2D model with a free fluid governed by Stokes flow in the bulk and a poroelastic plate described by the Biot-Kirchhoff equations on the surface. Assuming the form of a double perturbed saddle-point problem, the unique solvability of the continuous formulation is proved using Fredholm's theory for compact operators and the Babuska--Brezzi approach for saddle-point problems with penalty. We propose a stable virtual element method, establishing a discrete inf-sup condition under a small mesh assumption through a Fortin interpolant that requires only $H^1$-regularity for the Stokes problem. We show the well-posedness of the monolithic discrete formulation and introduce an equivalent fixed-point approach employed at the implementation level. The optimal convergence of the method in the energy norm is proved theoretically and is also confirmed numerically via computational experiments. We demonstrate an application of the model and the proposed scheme in the simulation of immune isolation using encapsulation with silicon nanopore membranes.</description>

      <title>Jacobi-accelerated FFT-based solver for smooth high-contrast data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational efficiency and rapid convergence of fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based solvers render them a powerful numerical tool for periodic cell problems in multiscale modeling. On regular grids, they tend to outperform traditional numerical methods. However, we show that their convergence slows down significantly when applied to microstructures with smooth, highly-contrasted coefficients. To address this loss of performance, we introduce a Green-Jacobi preconditioner, an enhanced successor to the standard discrete Green preconditioner that preserves the quasilinear complexity, $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$, of conventional FFT-based solvers. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Jacobi-accelerated FFT (J-FFT) solver within a linear elastic framework. For problems characterized by smooth data and high material contrast, J-FFT significantly reduces the iteration count of the conjugate gradient method compared to the standard Green preconditioner. These findings are particularly relevant for phase-field fracture simulations, density-based topology optimization, and solvers that use adaption of the grid, which all introduce smooth variations in the material properties that challenge conventional FFT-based solvers.</description>

      <title>The essential spectrum of periodically stationary pulses in lumped models of short-pulse fiber lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern short pulse fiber lasers there is significant pulse breathing over each round trip of the laser loop. Consequently, averaged models cannot be used for quantitative modeling and design. Instead, lumped models, which are obtained by concatenating models for the various components of the laser, are required. Since the pulses in lumped models are periodic rather than stationary, their linear stability is evaluated with the aid of the monodromy operator obtained by linearizing the round trip operator about the periodic pulse. Conditions are given on the smoothness and decay of the periodic pulse which ensure that the monodromy operator exists on an appropriate Lebesgue function space. A formula for the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator is given which can be used to quantify the growth rate of continuous wave perturbations. This formula is established by showing that the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator equals that of an associated asymptotic operator. Since the asymptotic monodromy operator acts as a multiplication operator in the Fourier domain, it is possible to derive a formula for its spectrum. Although the main results are stated for a particular experimental stretched pulse laser, the analysis shows that they can be readily adapted to a wide range of lumped laser models.</description>

      <title>From Taylor Series to Fourier Synthesis: The Periodic Linear Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple, monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization, which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers, achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself.</description>

      <title>Singular values of sparse random rectangular matrices: Emergence of outliers at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the random bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n, m, p)$, where each edge with one vertex in $V_{1}=[n]$ and the other vertex in $V_{2} =[m]$ is connected with probability $p$, and $n=\lfloor \gamma m\rfloor$ for a constant aspect ratio $\gamma \geq 1$. It is well known that the empirical spectral measure of its centered and normalized adjacency matrix converges to the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur (MP) distribution. However, largest and smallest singular values may not converge to the right and left edges, respectively, especially when $p = o(1)$. Notably, it was proved by Dumitriu and Zhu (2024) that there are almost surely no singular value outside the compact support of the MP law when $np = \omega(\log(n))$. In this paper, we consider the critical sparsity regime where $p = b\log(n)/\sqrt{mn}$ for some constant $b&gt;0$. We quantitatively characterize the emergence of outlier singular values as follows. For explicit $b_{*}$ and $b^{*}$ functions of $\gamma$, we prove that when $b &gt; b_{*}$, there is no outlier outside the bulk; when $b^{*}&lt; b &lt; b_{*}$, outliers are present only outside the right edge of the MP law; and when $b &lt; b^{*}$, outliers are present on both sides, all with high probability. Moreover, locations of those outliers are precisely characterized by a function depending on the largest and smallest degree vertices of the random graph. We estimate the number of outliers as well. Our results follow the path forged by Alt, Ducatez and Knowles (2021), and can be extended to sparse random rectangular matrices with bounded entries.</description>

      <title>The Vanishing Gradient Problem for Stiff Neural Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness. Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is $O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>Neural Policy Iteration for Stochastic Optimal Control: A Physics-Informed Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI) framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings, inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.</description>

      <title>Multi-material structural optimization for additive manufacturing based on a phase field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topology optimization problem in a phase field setting is considered to obtain rigid structures, which are resilient to external forces and constructable with additive manufacturing. Hence, large deformations of overhangs due to gravity shall be avoided during construction. The deformations depend on the stage of the construction and are modelled by linear elasticity equations on growing domains with height-dependent stress tensors and forces. Herewith, possible hardening effects can be included. Analytical results concerning the existence of minimizers and the differentiability of the reduced cost functional are presented in case of a finite number of construction layers. By proving Korn's inequality with a constant independent of the height, it is shown that the cost functional, formulated continuously in height, is well-defined. The problem is numerically solved using a projected gradient type method in function space, for which applicability is shown. Second-order information can be included by adapting the underlying inner product in every iteration. Additional adjustments enhancing the solver's performance, such as a nested procedure and subsystem solver specifcations, are stated. Numerical evidence is provided that for all discretization level and also for any number of construction layers, the iteration numbers stay roughly constant. The benefits of the nested procedure as well as of the inclusion of second order information are illustrated. Furthermore, the choice of weights for the penalization of overhangs is discussed. For various problem settings, results are presented for one or two materials and void in two as well as in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Model reduction for fully nonlinear stochastic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</description>

      <title>ASPEN: An Additional Sampling Penalty Method for Finite-Sum Optimization Problems with Nonlinear Equality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for solving non-convex, nonlinear equality-constrained finite-sum optimization problems. The proposed algorithm incorporates an additional sampling strategy for sample size update into the well-known framework of quadratic penalty methods. Thus, depending on the problem at hand, the resulting method may exhibit a sample size strategy ranging from a mini-batch on one end, to increasing sample size that achieves the full sample eventually, on the other end of the spectrum. A non-monotone line search is used for the step size update, while the penalty parameter is also adaptive. The proposed algorithm avoids costly projections, which, together with the sample size update, may yield significant computational cost savings. Also, the proposed method can be viewed as a transition of an additional sampling approach for unconstrained and linear constrained problems, to a more general class with non-linear constraints. The almost sure convergence is proved under a standard set of assumptions for this framework, while numerical experiments on both academic and real-data based machine learning problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving numerical schemes for Lindblad equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.01194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of structure-preserving deterministic numerical schemes for Lindblad equations. This family of schemes has a simple form and can systemically achieve arbitrary high-order accuracy in theory. Moreover, these schemes can also overcome the non-physical issues that arise from many traditional numerical schemes. Due to their preservation of physical nature, these schemes can be straightforwardly used as backbones for further developing randomized and quantum algorithms in simulating Lindblad equations. In this work, we systematically study this family of structure-preserving deterministic schemes and perform a detailed error analysis, which is validated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Nonlocal Approximation to Manifold Poisson Models with Neumann Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of nonlocal models to approximate the Poisson model on manifolds with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition, where the manifolds are assumed to be embedded in high dimensional Euclid spaces.
  In comparison to the existing nonlocal approximation of Poisson models with Neumann boundary, we optimize the truncation error of model by adding an augmented function involving the second order normal derivative along the $2\delta$ layer of boundary, with $2\delta$ be the nonlocal interaction horizon. The 2nd normal derivative is expressed as the difference between the interior Laplacian and the boundary Laplacian.
  The concentration of our paper is on the construction of nonlocal model, the well-posedness of model, and its second-order convergence rate to its local counterpart. The localization rate of our nonlocal model is currently optimal among all related works even for the case of high dimensional Euclid spaces.</description>

      <title>Regularization with optimal space-time priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variational regularization approach based on a multiscale representation called cylindrical shearlets aimed at dynamic imaging problems, especially dynamic tomography. The intuitive idea of our approach is to integrate a sequence of separable static problems in the mismatch term of the cost function, while the regularization term handles the nonstationary target as a spatio-temporal object. This approach is motivated by the fact that cylindrical shearlets provide (nearly) optimally sparse approximations on an idealized class of functions modeling spatio-temportal data and the numerical observation that they provide highly sparse approximations even for more general spatio-temporal image sequences found in dynamic tomography applications. To formulate our regularization model, we introduce cylindrical shearlet smoothness spaces, which are instrumental for defining suitable embeddings in functional spaces. We prove that the proposed regularization strategy is well-defined, and the minimization problem has a unique solution (for $ p &gt; 1$). Furthermore, we provide convergence rates (in terms of the symmetric Bregman distance) under deterministic and random noise conditions, within the context of statistical inverse learning. We numerically validate our theoretical results using both simulated and measured dynamic tomography data, showing that our approach leads to an efficient and robust reconstruction strategy.</description>

      <title>Tangential-Normal Decompositions of Finite Element Differential Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel tangential-normal ($t$-$n$) decomposition for finite element differential forms, presenting a new framework for constructing bases in finite element exterior calculus. The main contribution is the development of a $t$-$n$ basis where degrees of freedom and shape functions are explicitly dual, a property that streamlines stiffness matrix assembly and enhances the efficiency of interpolation and numerical integration. Additionally, the integration of the well-documented Lagrange element basis supports practical implementation of finite element differential forms in applications. A geometric decomposition using newly defined bubble polynomial forms is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the recently-proposed hyperbolic approximation of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV). We show that this approximation, which we call KdVH, possesses a rich variety of solutions, including solitary wave solutions that approximate KdV solitons, as well as other solitary and periodic solutions that are related to higher-order water wave models, and may include singularities. We analyze a class of implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta time discretizations for KdVH that are asymptotic preserving, energy conserving, and can be applied to other hyperbolized systems. We also develop structure-preserving spatial discretizations based on summation-by-parts operators in space including finite difference, discontinuous Galerkin, and Fourier methods. We use the entropy relaxation approach to make the fully discrete schemes energy-preserving. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these discretizations.</description>

      <title>A persistent homology based prior for the potential coefficient reconstruction problem in an elliptic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the reconstruction of a potential coefficient in an elliptic problem from distributed observations within the Bayesian framework. In such problems, the selection of an appropriate prior distribution is crucial, particularly when the function to be inferred exhibits sharp discontinuities, as traditional Gaussian priors often prove inadequate. To tackle this challenge, we develop a persistent homology based prior (PH), a new prior constructed using persistent homology. The proposed prior utilizes persistent pairs to characterize and record the topological variations of the functions under reconstruction, thereby encoding prior information about the structure and discontinuities of the function. The PH prior, however, only exists in a discretized formulation, which leads to the absence of a well-defined posterior measure in function spaces. To resolve this issue, we propose a PH-Gaussian hybrid prior, where the PH component detects sharp discontinuities in the function, while the Gaussian distribution acts as a reference measure, ensuring a well-defined posterior measure in the function space. The proposed PH prior exhibits properties analogous to those of the classical TV prior, while providing enhanced flexibility and a wider range of applications. This positions the PH prior as a natural generalization of the TV prior framework.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction of hemodynamics by space-time reduced basis and reduced fluid-structure interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we apply the space-time Galerkin reduced basis (ST-GRB) method to a reduced fluid-structure interaction model, for the numerical simulation of hemodynamics in arteries. In essence, ST-GRB extends the classical reduced basis (RB) method, exploiting a data-driven low-dimensional linear encoding of the temporal dynamics to further cut the computational costs. The current investigation brings forth two key enhancements, compared to previous works on the topic. On the one side, we model blood flow through the Navier-Stokes equations, hence accounting for convection. In this regard, we implement a hyper-reduction scheme, based on approximate space-time reduced affine decompositions, to deal with nonlinearities effectively. On the other side, we move beyond the constraint of modelling blood vessels as rigid structures, acknowledging the importance of elasticity for the accurate simulation of complex blood flow patterns. To limit computational complexity, we adopt the Coupled Momentum model, incorporating the effect of wall compliance in the fluid's equations through a generalized Robin boundary condition. In particular, we propose an efficient strategy for handling the spatio-temporal projection of the structural displacement, which ultimately configures as a by-product. The performances of ST-GRB are assessed in three different numerical experiments. The results confirm that the proposed approach can outperform the classical RB method, yielding precise approximations of high-fidelity solutions at more convenient costs. However, the computational gains of ST-GRB vanish if the number of retained temporal modes is too large, which occurs either when complex dynamics arise or if very precise solutions are sought.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error distribution for stochastic Runge--Kutta methods of strong order one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work gives the asymptotic error distribution of the stochastic Runge--Kutta (SRK) method of strong order $1$ applied to Stratonovich-type stochastic differential equations. For dealing with the implicitness introduced in the diffusion term, we propose a framework to derive the asymptotic error distribution of diffusion-implicit or fully implicit numerical methods, which enables us to construct a fully explicit numerical method sharing the same asymptotic error distribution as the SRK method. Further, we show that the limit distribution $U(T)$ satisfies $\mathbf E|U(T)|^2\le e^{L_1T}(1+\eta_1)T^3$ for some $\eta_1\ge0$ only depending on the coefficients of the SRK method. Thus, we infer that $\eta_1$ is the key parameter reflecting the growth rate of the mean-square error of the SRK method. Especially, among the SRK methods of strong order $1$, those of weak order $2$ correspond to $\eta_1=0$, sharing the unified asymptotic error distribution, and have the smallest mean-square errors after a long time. This property is also found for the case of additive noise. It seems that we are the first to give the asymptotic error distribution of fully implicit numerical methods for stochastic differential equations.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops stable finite element pairs for the linear stress gradient elasticity model, overcoming classical elasticity's limitations in capturing size effects. We analyze mesh conditions to establish parameter-robust error estimates for the proposed pairs, achieving unconditional stability for finite elements with higher vertex continuity and conditional stability for Continuous Galerkin-Discontinuous Galerkin (CG-DG) pairs when no interior vertex has edges lying on three or fewer lines. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, demonstrating optimal convergence rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal diffuse interface model for phase transition and interface evolution involving heat transfer. This model is constructed by integrating concepts from classical irreversible thermodynamics with the energetic variational approach. By making specific assumptions about the kinematics of the temperature, we derive a non-isothermal Allen-Cahn equation. Through both asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that in the sharp interface limit, the non-isothermal Allen-Cahn equation converges to a two-phase nonlinear Stefan type problem, under a certain scale of the melting/freezing energy. In this regime, the motion of the liquid-solid interface and the temperature interface coincide and are governed by the mean curvature, at least for a short time. The result provides a justification for the classical Stefan problem within a certain physical regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (NAG) achieves faster convergence than gradient descent for convex optimization but lacks monotonicity in function values. To address this, Beck and Teboulle [2009b] proposed a monotonic variant, M-NAG, and extended it to the proximal setting as M-FISTA for composite problems such as Lasso. However, establishing the linear convergence of M-NAG and M-FISTA under strong convexity remains an open problem. In this paper, we analyze M-NAG via the implicit-velocity phase representation and show that an additional assumption, either the position update or the phase-coupling relation, is necessary to fully recover the NAG iterates. The essence of M-NAG lies in controlling an auxiliary sequence to enforce non-increase. We further demonstrate that the M-NAG update alone is sufficient to construct a Lyapunov function guaranteeing linear convergence, without relying on full NAG iterates. By modifying the mixed sequence to incorporate forward-indexed gradients, we develop a new Lyapunov function that removes the kinetic energy term, enabling a direct extension to M-NAG. The required starting index depends only on the momentum parameter and not on problem constants. Finally, leveraging newly developed proximal inequalities, we extend our results to M-FISTA, establishing its linear convergence and deepening the theoretical understanding of monotonic accelerated methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to combine the advantages of the Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson JMGT equation as an advanced model in nonlinear acoustics with a frequency domain formulation of the forward and inverse problem of acoustic nonlinearity parameter tomography, enabling the multiplication of information by nonlinearity. Our main result is local uniqueness of the space dependent nonlinearity parameter from boundary measurements, which we achieve by linearized uniqueness with an Implicit Function type perturbation argument in appropriately chosen topologies. Moreover, we shortly dwell on the application of a regularized Newton type method for reconstructing the nonlinearity coefficient, whose convergence can be established by means of the linear uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>On the use of the principle of maximum entropy to improve the robustness of bivariate spline least-squares approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider fitting a bivariate spline regression model to data using a weighted least-squares cost function, with weights that sum to one to form a discrete probability distribution. By applying the principle of maximum entropy, the weight distribution is determined by maximizing the associated entropy function. This approach, previously applied successfully to polynomials and spline curves, enhances the robustness of the regression model by automatically detecting and down-weighting anomalous data during the fitting process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we present applications to two image processing problems and further illustrate its potential through two synthetic examples.
  Unlike the standard ordinary least-squares method, the maximum entropy formulation leads to a nonlinear algebraic system whose solvability requires careful theoretical analysis. We provide preliminary results in this direction and discuss the computational implications of solving the associated constrained optimization problem, which calls for dedicated iterative algorithms. These aspects suggest natural directions for further research on both the theoretical and algorithmic fronts.</description>

Abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are widely used in machine learning for tasks such as clustering, classification, image reconstruction, and generative modeling. A key challenge in working with GMMs is defining a computationally efficient and geometrically meaningful metric. The mixture Wasserstein (MW) distance adapts the Wasserstein metric to GMMs and has been applied in various domains, including domain adaptation, dataset comparison, and reinforcement learning. However, its high computational cost -- arising from repeated Wasserstein distance computations involving matrix square root estimations and an expensive linear program -- limits its scalability to high-dimensional and large-scale problems. To address this, we propose multiple novel slicing-based approximations to the MW distance that significantly reduce computational complexity while preserving key optimal transport properties. From a theoretical viewpoint, we establish several weak and strong equivalences between the introduced metrics, and show the relations to the original MW distance and the well-established sliced Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating computational efficiency and applications in clustering, perceptual image comparison, and GMM minimization</description>
