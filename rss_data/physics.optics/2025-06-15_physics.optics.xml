      <title>Passive radiative cooling using temperature-dependent emissivity can sometimes outperform static emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In passive sky-facing radiative cooling, wavelength-selective thermal emitters in the atmospheric transparency window of 8-13 $\mu$m can reach lower temperatures compared to broadband emitters, but broadband emitters always have higher cooling power when the emitter is warmer than the ambient. Here, we propose a temperature-tunable thermal emitter that switches between a wavelength-selective state -- with high emissivity only in the atmospheric transparency window of 8-13 $\mu$m -- and a broadband-emissive state with high emissivity in the 3-25 $\mu$m range, thus maintaining high cooling potential across all temperatures. We also propose a realization of such a temperature-tunable emitter using the phase transition of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$), which can be tuned to the ambient temperature using a combination of doping and defect engineering.</description>

      <title>Ray Optics Approach to Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieving the phase of a complex-valued field from the measurements of its amplitude is a crucial problem with a wide range of applications in microscopy and ultracold atomic physics. In particular, obtaining an accurate and efficient solution to this problem is a key step in shaping laser beams for trapping atoms in optical tweezer arrays and applying high-fidelity entangling gates on a neutral atom quantum computer. Current approaches to this problem fail to converge on the optimal solution due to a phenomenon known as vortex formation. In this work, we present an efficient optimization algorithm using Optimal Transport. Our approach completely bypasses the creation of phase vortices and allows for a state-of-the-art solution both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we show a deep theoretical connection between the Optimal Transport plan and the ray-optics limit of the Wigner distribution of the unknown complex-valued field, and show that our method can be used to retrieve the phase-space transformation of any unknown quadratic phase system. Finally, we reinterpret this problem in the modern quantum learning framework. The techniques we develop provide both useful intuition and practical tools for advancing the frontiers of phase retrieval and laser beam shaping.</description>

      <title>A curvilinear framework for vector light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector beams are often regarded as non-separable superpositions of spatial and polarization degrees of freedom that satisfy the wave equation. This interpretation ties their polarization structure to their spatial shape. Here, we introduce a generalized method to construct vector beams whose structure is entirely encoded in the polarization degree of freedom. Using conformal maps, we construct orthonormal polarization bases from the geometry of the coordinates and encode them experimentally via phase-only spatial light modulators. We apply our method to four systems, elliptical, parabolic, bipolar, and dipole, that represent algebraic and transcendental families of conformal maps. Stokes polarimetry measurements confirm agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>HoToPy: A toolbox for X-ray holo-tomography in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Python toolbox for holographic and tomographic X-ray imaging. It comprises a collection of phase retrieval algorithms for the deeply holographic and direct contrast imaging regimes, including non-linear approaches and extended choices of regularization, constraint sets, and optimizers, all implemented with a unified and intuitive interface. Moreover, it features auxiliary functions for (tomographic) alignment, image processing, and simulation of imaging experiments. The capability of the toolbox is illustrated by the example of a catalytic nanoparticle, imaged in the deeply holographic regime at the 'GINIX' instrument of the P10 beamline at the PETRA III storage ring (DESY, Hamburg). Due to its modular design, the toolbox can be used for algorithmic development and benchmarking in a lean and flexible manner, or be interfaced and integrated in the reconstruction pipeline of other synchrotron or XFEL instruments for phase imaging based on propagation.</description>

      <title>Bistable random momentum transfer in a linear on-chip resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical switches and bifurcation rely on the nonlinear response of materials. Here, we demonstrate linear temporal bifurcation responses in a passive multimode microresonator, with strongly coupled chaotic and whispering gallery modes or WGMs. In microdisks, the chaotic modes exhibit broadband transfer within the deformed cavities, but their transient response is less explored and yields a random output of the analog signal distributed uniformly from 0 to 1. Here, we build chaotic states by perturbing the multi-mode microring resonators with densely packed silicon nanocrystals on the waveguide surface. In vivo measurements reveal random and digitized output that ONLY populates around 0 and 1 intensity levels. The bus waveguide mode couples firstly to chaotic modes, then either dissipates or tunnels into stable WGMs. This binary pathway generates high-contrast, digitized outputs. The fully passive device enables real-time conversion of periodic clock signals into binary outputs with contrasts exceeding 12.3 dB, data rates of up to 100 Mbits per second, and 20dB dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Few-MHz bandwidth tunable optical filter based on a fiber-ring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fiber-ring resonator that realizes an ultra-narrowband, high-extinction, low-loss, tunable optical filter. It consists of a pair of commercial variable ratio directional couplers that allow precise adjustment of the filter bandwidth and its on-resonance transmission. This design also grants access to multiple modes of operation, such as a simultaneous band-stop and band-pass filter. Our characterization reveals a bandwidth of less than 2 MHz, together with an extinction exceeding 20 dB. The tunability of the filter properties establishes our device as a versatile platform for selective frequency filtering with sub-natural atomic linewidth resolution.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-inspired frequency-agile rangefinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement, a key feature of quantum mechanics, is recognized for its non-classical correlations which have been shown to provide significant noise resistance in single-photon rangefinding and communications. Drawing inspiration from the advantage given by energy-time entanglement, we developed an energy-time correlated source based on a classical laser that preserves the substantial noise reduction typical of quantum illumination while surpassing the quantum brightness limitation by over six orders of magnitude, making it highly suitable for practical remote sensing applications. A frequency-agile pseudo-random source is realized through fibre chromatic dispersion and pulse carving using an electro-optic intensity modulator. Operating at a faint transmission power of 48 {\mu}W, the distance between two buildings 154.8182 m apart can be measured with a precision better than 0.1 mm, under varying solar background levels and weather conditions with an integration time of only 100 ms. These trials verified the predicted noise reduction of this system, demonstrating advantages over quantum illumination-based rangefinding and highlighting its potential for practical remote sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Two-stage, low noise quantum frequency conversion of single photons from silicon-vacancy centers in diamond to the telecom C-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The silicon-vacancy center in diamond holds great promise as a qubit for quantum communication networks. However, since the optical transitions are located within the visible red spectral region, quantum frequency conversion to low-loss telecommunication wavelengths becomes a necessity for its use in long-range, fiber-linked networks. This work presents a highly efficient, low-noise quantum frequency conversion device for photons emitted by a silicon-vacancy (SiV) center in diamond to the telecom C-band. By using a two-stage difference-frequency mixing scheme SPDC noise is circumvented and Raman noise is minimized, resulting in a very low noise rate of $10.4 \pm 0.7$ photons per second as well as an overall device efficiency of $35.6\, \%$. By converting single photons from SiV centers we demonstrate the preservation of photon statistics upon conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) micro- and nano-scale light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are vital to the next-generation optoelectronic applications such as ultrahigh-speed optical interconnects and near-eye augmented/virtual reality displays. However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions introduces several challenges, including an increased nonradiative recombination from surface states and defect-related emission degradation. In this work, we present a high-performance, strain-relaxed nanoscale LED array, fabricated using a top-down nanostructuring approach applied to a high-quality, all-InGaN (quantum well/barrier) LED structure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on bulk GaN substrates. Combining an ultra-low threading dislocation density bulk GaN substrate and effective sidewall passivation with atomic layer deposition (ALD) results in excellent diode rectification characteristics and extremely low leakage currents. Electroluminescence measurements reveal bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46% at an elevated injection current density of ~1.2 kA/cm2.</description>

      <title>Transformable Plasmonic Helix with Swinging Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control over multiple optical elements that can be dynamically rearranged to yield substantial three-dimensional structural transformations is of great importance to realize reconfigurable plasmonic nanoarchitectures with sensitive and distinct optical feedback. In this work, we demonstrate a transformable plasmonic helix system, in which multiple gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be directly transported by DNA swingarms to target positions without undergoing consecutive stepwise movements. The swingarms allow for programmable AuNP translocations in large leaps within plasmonic nanoarchitectures, giving rise to tailored circular dichroism spectra. Our work provides an instructive bottom-up solution to building complex dynamic plasmonic systems, which can exhibit prominent optical responses through cooperative rearrangements of the constituent optical elements with high fidelity and programmability.</description>

      <title>Gradients of unitary optical neural networks using parameter-shift rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of the parameter-shift rule (PSR) for computing gradients in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs). While backpropagation has been fundamental to training conventional neural networks, its implementation in optical neural networks faces significant challenges due to the physical constraints of optical systems. We demonstrate how PSR, which calculates gradients by evaluating functions at shifted parameter values, can be effectively adapted for training UONNs constructed from Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes. The method leverages the inherent Fourier series nature of optical interference in these systems to compute exact analytical gradients directly from hardware measurements. This approach offers a promising alternative to traditional in silico training methods and circumvents the limitations of both finite difference approximations and all-optical backpropagation implementations. We present the theoretical framework and practical methodology for applying PSR to optimize phase parameters in optical neural networks, potentially advancing the development of efficient hardware-based training strategies for optical computing systems.</description>

      <title>The Darkfield Approach to Measuring Vacuum Birefringence and Light-by-Light Couplings -- A Proof-of-Principle Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum fluctuations give rise to effective nonlinear interactions between electromagnetic fields. These generically modify the characteristics of light traversing a strong-field region. X-ray free-electron lasers constitute a particularly promising probe, due to their brilliance, the possibility of precise control and favourable frequency scaling. However, the nonlinear vacuum response is very small even when probing a tightly focused high-intensity laser field with XFEL radiation and direct measurement of light-by-light scattering of real photons and the associated fundamental physics constants of the quantum vacuum has not been possible to date. Achieving a sufficiently good signal-to-background separation is key to a successful quantum vacuum experiment. To master this challenge, a darkfield detection concept has recently been proposed. Here we present the results of a proof-of-principle experiment validating this approach at the High Energy Density scientific instrument of the European X-Ray Free Electron Laser.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chirality in the mid-infrared spectral range plays a crucial role across physical, chemical, and biological sciences, yet sources of chiral infrared light do not currently exist. Their development, using principles from the mature field of metamaterials, requires complex three-dimensional architectures that call for high-resolution lithography. We leverage the natural optical anisotropy found in several van der Waals crystals, for example $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, to demonstrate experimentally that its twisted bilayers break inversion-rotation symmetry and are thereby intrinsically chiral. Via direct thermal emission measurements of microscopic twisted bilayers, we demonstrate that these heterostructures generate chiral light through incandescence. Twisted configurations of van der Waals materials do not require any lithography, and offer a platform for large-scale chiral filters and thermal sources beyond conventional meta-architectures.</description>

      <title>A simple accurate way to model noise-seeded ultrafast nonlinear processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise can play an important role in nonlinear pulse propagation. It is not only the origin of fluctuations in supercontinuum but can also determine the generated signal amplitude and phase, as seen in phenomena such as noise-seeded four-wave mixing and spontaneous Raman scattering. Current models rely on input-pulse shot noise and Raman Langevin term to simulate noise-seeded Kerr effects and spontaneous Raman scattering, respectively. However, they cannot accurately simulate any nonlinear effects exhibiting asymmetries, for example, between spontaneous Stokes and anti-Stokes generation, or in amplification with emission and absorption cross sections. Moreover, combining these two techniques does not lead to accurate modeling of both effects simultaneously, especially in unsaturated Raman operational regimes or supercontinuum where spontaneous Raman emission noise plays a crucial role. To resolve this issue, we propose a new modified shot-noise model by directly introducing noise into the pulse propagation equation. It minimally modifies current models that contain only stimulated terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent interference in multimode photonic systems offers a transformative approach for scalable, high-fidelity optical control, enabling precise beam shaping, efficient power delivery, and advanced signal processing through single-mode performance. Current techniques are often constrained to a single polarization state of light, system complexity, and the fabrication challenges associated with precise waveguide structures. Here, we present a high-efficiency coherent combination scheme employing a commercial mode-selective photonic lantern supporting three spatial channels, achieving Gaussian mode interference at multiple locations along the multimode core with up to 100% mode conversion efficiencies. By integrating a Faraday reflecting fibre component and piezo-phase shifters with the photonic lantern channels, we demonstrate stable and adaptive mode manipulation without the need for complex adaptive optics. These findings highlight the potential of photonic lanterns as robust platforms for controlled mode interference, paving the way for their deployment in next-generation optical communication, beam shaping, and beam-forming systems.</description>
