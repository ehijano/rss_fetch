      <title>Expanding the ultracompacts: gravitational wave-driven mass transfer in the shortest-period binaries with accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of three ultracompact binary white dwarf systems hosting accretion disks, with orbital periods of 7.95, 8.68, and 13.15 minutes. This significantly augments the population of mass-transferring binaries at the shortest periods, and provides the first evidence that accretors in ultracompacts can be dense enough to host accretion disks even below 10 minutes (where previously only direct-impact accretors were known). In the two shortest-period systems, we measured changes in the orbital periods driven by the combined effect of gravitational wave emission and mass transfer; we find $\dot{P}$ is negative in one case, and positive in the other. This is only the second system measured with a positive $\dot{P}$, and it the most compact binary known that has survived a period minimum. Using these systems as examples, we show how the measurement of $\dot{P}$ is a powerful tool in constraining the physical properties of binaries, e.g. the mass and mass-radius relation of the donor stars. We find that the chirp masses of ultracompact binaries at these periods seem to cluster around $\mathcal{M}_c \sim 0.3 M_\odot$, perhaps suggesting a common origin for these systems or a selection bias in electromagnetic discoveries. Our new systems are among the highest-amplitude known gravitational wave sources in the millihertz regime, providing exquisite opportunity for multi-messenger study with future space-based observatories such as \textit{LISA} and TianQin; we discuss how such systems provide fascinating laboratories to study the unique regime where the accretion process is mediated by gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>A spectro-temporal view of normal branch oscillations in Cygnus X-2 as seen by NICER and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the spectro-temporal study of the neutron star low mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2 using NICER and NuSTAR data while the source was in the normal branch (NB). We detect a normal branch oscillation (NBO) feature at ~ 5.41 Hz that appears in the middle portion of the NB branch. We note that the NBO appeared only in the 0.5-3 keV energy range, with maximum strength in the 1-2 keV energy band, but was absent in the 3-10 keV energy band of NuSTAR and NICER data. The energy spectrum of the source exhibits an emission feature at ~ 1 keV, previously identified as the Fe L transition in the outer region of the accretion disk. Upon considering both the Fe L and NBO features, we suggest that the originating location of the Fe L line and the NBOs may coincide and perhaps be due to the same underlying mechanism. Therefore, lags seen in the frequency/energy dependent lag spectra of Cygnus X-2 could be considered to be arising from a region of photoionized material far from the central source. We study the frequency and energy dependent lag spectra of the source, which exhibited a few milliseconds hard lag at the NBO frequency (12-15 ms) and a switch from hard to soft lags at 1 keV. The rms spectrum peaks at 1 keV and the covariance spectrum clearly resembles a thermal spectrum. We discuss the spectro-temporal behavior of the NBO and attempt to constrain its location of origin.</description>

      <title>Cocoon shock, X-ray cavities and extended Inverse Compton emission in Hercules A: clues from Chandra observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of jet activity in the radio galaxy 3C348 at the center of the galaxy cluster Hercules A. We use archival Chandra data to investigate the jet-driven shock front, the radio-faint X-ray cavities, the eastern jet, and the presence of extended Inverse Compton (IC) X-ray emission from the radio lobes. We detect two pairs of shocks: one in the north-south direction at 150 kpc from the center, and another in the east-west direction at 280 kpc. These shocks have Mach numbers of $\mathcal{M} = 1.65\pm0.05$ and $\mathcal{M} = 1.9\pm0.3$, respectively. Together, they form a complete cocoon around the large radio lobes. Based on the distance of the shocks from the center, we estimate that the corresponding jet outburst is 90-150 Myr old. We confirm the presence of two radio-faint cavities within the cocoon, misaligned from the lobes, each $\sim$100 kpc wide and 40-60 Myr old. A backflow from the radio lobes might explain why the cavities are dynamically younger than the cocoon shock front. We also detect non-thermal X-ray emission from the eastern jet and from the large radio lobes. The X-ray emission from the jet is visible at 80 kpc from the AGN and can be accounted for by an IC model with a mild Doppler boosting ($\delta\sim2.7$). A synchrotron model could explain the radio-to-X-ray spectrum only for very high Lorentz factors $\gamma\geq10^{8}$ of the electrons in the jet. For the large radio lobes, we argue that the X-ray emission has an IC origin, with a 1 keV flux density of $21.7\pm1.4\text{(statistical)}\pm1.3\text{(systematic)}$ nJy. A thermal model is unlikely, as it would require unrealistically high gas temperature, density, and pressure, along with a strong depolarization of the radio lobes, which are instead highly polarized. The IC detection, combined with the synchrotron flux density, suggests a magnetic field of $12\pm3\mu$G in the lobes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mission Observations of Relativistic Electrons and High-Speed Jets Linked to Shock Generated Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock-generated transients, such as hot flow anomalies (HFAs), upstream of planetary bow shocks, play a critical role in electron acceleration. Using multi-mission data from NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and ESA's Cluster missions, we demonstrate the transmission of HFAs through Earth's quasi-parallel bow shock, associated with acceleration of electrons up to relativistic energies. Energetic electrons, initially accelerated upstream, are shown to remain broadly confined within the transmitted transient structures downstream, where betatron acceleration further boosts their energy due to elevated compression levels. Additionally, high-speed jets form at the compressive edges of HFAs, exhibiting a significant increase in dynamic pressure and potentially contributing to driving further localized compression. Our findings emphasize the efficiency of quasi-parallel shocks in driving particle acceleration far beyond the immediate shock transition region, expanding the acceleration region to a larger spatial domain. Finally, this study underscores the importance of multi-scale observational approach in understanding the convoluted processes behind collisionless shock physics and their broader implications.</description>

      <title>How do supernova remnants cool? II. Machine learning analysis of supernova remnant simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About 15%-60% of all supernova remnants are estimated to interact with dense molecular clouds.In these high density environments, radiative losses are significant.The cooling radiation can be observed in forbidden lines at optical wavelengths.We aim to determine whether supernovae at different positions within a molecular cloud can be distinguished based on their optical emission, using machine learning.We have conducted a statistical analysis of the optical line emission of simulated supernovae interacting with molecular clouds that formed from the multi-phase interstellar medium modelled in the SILCC-Zoom simulations with and without magnetic fields. This work is based on the post-processing of 3-D (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations.Our data set consists of 22 simulations. The supernovae are placed at a distance of either 25 pc or 50 pc from the molecular cloud centre of mass. First, we calculate optical synthetic emission maps (taking into account dust attenuation within the simulation sub-cube). Second, we analyse the data set of synthetic observations using principle component analysis to identify clusters with the k-means algorithm. We find that the presence or absence of magnetic fields has no statistically significant effect on the optical line emission. However, the ambient density distribution at the site of the supernova changes the entire evolution and morphology of the supernova remnant. Due to the different ambient densities in the 25 pc and 50 pc simulations, we are able to distinguish them in a statistically significant manner. Although, optical line attenuation within the supernova remnant can mimic this result depending on the attenuation model that is used. That is why, multi-dimensional analysis of optical emission line ratios in this work does not give extra information about the environmental conditions (ambient density and ambient magnetic field) of the SNR.</description>

      <title>Maximal Jet Energy of Gamma-Ray Bursts through the Blandford-Znajek Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, driven by relativistic jets launched from black holes (BHs) formed during the collapse of massive stars or after the merger of two neutron stars (NSs). The jet power depends on the BH spin and the magnetic flux accreted onto it. In the standard thin disk model, jet power is limited by insufficient magnetic flux, even when the spin approaches maximum possible value. In contrast, the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state limits jet energy by extracting significant angular momentum, braking BH rotation. We propose a unified model incorporating both standard thin disk and MAD states, identifying a universal curve for jet power per accretion rate as a function of the magnetic flux ratio, $\Delta_\mathrm{eq} = (\Phi_\mathrm{BH}/\Phi_\mathrm{MAD})_\mathrm{eq}$, at spin equilibrium. For long GRBs (lGRBs), the model predicts a maximum jet energy of $\sim 1.5\%$ of the accretion energy, occurring at $\Delta_\mathrm{eq} \sim 0.4$ where the BH equilibrium spin is $a \sim 0.5$. Both long and short GRBs are unlikely to be produced by a MAD: for short GRBs (sGRBs), this requires an accreted mass orders of magnitude smaller than that available, while for lGRBs, the narrow progenitor mass distribution challenges the ability to produce the observed broad distribution of jet energies. This framework provides a consistent explanation for both standard and luminous GRBs, emphasizing the critical role of magnetic flux. Both long and short GRBs require magnetic flux distributions that peak around $10^{27}\,\mathrm{G\,cm}^2$.</description>

      <title>Non-Newtonian corrections to radiative viscosity: Israel-Stewart theory as a viscosity limiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation is a universal friction-increasing agent. When two fluid layers are in relative motion, the inevitable exchange of radiation between such layers gives rise to an effective force, which tries to prevent the layers from sliding. This friction is often modeled as a Navier-Stokes shear viscosity. However, non-Newtonian corrections are expected to appear at distances of about one optical depth from the layers' interface. Such corrections prevent the viscous stress from becoming too large. Here, we set the foundations of a rigorous theory for these corrections, valid along incompressible flows. We show that, in the linear regime, the infinite Chapman-Enskog series can be computed analytically, leading to universal formulas for all transport coefficients, which apply to any fluid, with any composition, with radiation of any type (also neutrinos), and with nearly any type of radiative process. We then show that, with an appropriate shear-heat coupling coefficient, Israel-Stewart theory can correctly describe most non-Newtonian features of radiative shear stresses.</description>

      <title>Kicking the Tires on Picolensing as a Probe of Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-lensing parallax of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an intriguing probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the asteroid-mass window, $2\times 10^{-16}M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{\text{PBH}} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$. Recent work in the literature has shown exciting potential reach for this "picolensing" signal if a future space mission were to fly two x-/$\gamma$-ray detectors in the Swift/BAT class, with inter-spacecraft separation baselines on the order of the Earth-Moon distance. We revisit these projections with a view to understanding their robustness to various uncertainties related to GRBs. Most importantly, we investigate the impact of uncertainties in observed GRB angular sizes on reach projections for a future mission. Overall, we confirm that picolensing shows great promise to explore the asteroid-mass window; however, we find that previous studies may have been too optimistic with regard to the baselines required. Detector baselines on the order of at least the Earth-L2 distance would make such a mission more robust to GRB size uncertainties; baselines on the order of an astronomical unit (AU) would additionally enable reach that equals or exceeds existing microlensing constraints up to $M_{\text{PBH}}\sim 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Detection of the orbital modulation of Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence emission in Centaurus X-3using the high-resolution spectrometer Resolve onboard XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line emission in X-ray spectra is a powerful diagnostic tool for various astrophysical objects to reveal the distribution of cold matter around photo-ionizing sources. The advent of the X-ray microcalorimeter onboard the \textit{XRISM} satellite will bring new constraints on the emission line. We present one of the first such results for the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3, which is composed of an O-type star and a neutron star (NS). We conducted a 155 ks observation covering an entire binary orbit. A weak Fe K$\alpha$ line was detected in all orbital phases at an equivalent width (EW) of 10--20 eV. We found for the first time that its radial velocity (RV) is sinusoidally modulated by the orbital phase. The RV amplitude is 248 $\pm$ 13 km s$^{-1}$, which is significantly smaller than the value (391 km s$^{-1}$) expected if the emission is from the NS surface, but is consistent if the emission takes place at the O star surface. We discuss several possibilities of the line production site, including the NS surface, O star surface, O star wind, and accretion stream from the O star to the NS. We ran radiative transfer calculation for some of them assuming spherically-symmetric density and velocity profiles and an isotropic distribution of X-ray emission from the NS. None of them explains the observed EW and velocity dispersion dependence on the orbital phase, suggesting that more elaborated modeling is needed. In other words, the present observational results have capability to constrain deviations from these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic seed generation by plasma heat flux in accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Magnetic batteries are potential sources that may drive the generation of a seed magnetic field, even if this field is initially zero. These batteries can be the result of non-aligned thermodynamic gradients in a plasma, as well as of special and general relativistic effects. So far, magnetic batteries have only been studied in ideal magnetized fluids. Aims. We study the non-ideal fluid effects introduced by the energy flux in the vortical dynamics of a magnetized plasma in curved spacetime. We propose a novel mechanism for generating a heat flux-driven magnetic seed within a simple accretion disk model around a Schwarzschild black hole. Methods. We use the 3+1 formalism for the splitting of the space-time metric into space-like and time-like components. We study the vortical dynamics of a magnetized fluid with a heat flux in the Schwarzschild geometry in which thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities are only dependent on the radial coordinate. Assuming that the magnetic field is initially zero, we estimate linear time evolution of the magnetic field due to the inclusion of non-ideal fluid effects. Results. When the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities vary only radially, the effect of the coupling between the heat flux, spacetime curvature and fluid velocity acts as the primary driver for an initial linearly time growing magnetic field. The plasma heat flux completely dominates the magnetic field generation at an specific distance from the black hole, where the fluid vorticity vanishes. This distance depends on the thermodynamical properties of the Keplerian plasma accretion disk. These properties control the strength of the non-ideal effects in the generation of seed magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Light Curve Properties of Gamma-Ray Burst Associated Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rapidly spinning, millisecond magnetar is widely considered one of the most plausible power sources for gamma-ray burst-associated supernovae (GRB-SNe). Recent studies have demonstrated that the magnetar model can effectively explain the bolometric light curves of most GRB-SNe. In this work, we investigate the bolometric light curves of 13 GRB-SNe, focusing on key observational parameters such as peak luminosity, rise time, and decay time, estimated using Gaussian Process (GP) regression for light curve fitting. We also apply Principal Component Analysis to all the light curve parameters to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the distribution of SNe in lower-dimensional space. Our findings indicate that while most GRB-SNe share common physical characteristics, a few outliers, notably SNe 2010ma and 2011kl, exhibit distinct features. These events suggest potential differences in progenitor properties or explosion mechanisms, offering deeper insight into the diversity of GRB-SNe and their central engines.</description>

      <title>Eppur si muove: Evidence of disc precession or a sub-milliparsec SMBH binary in the QPE-emitting galaxy GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense soft X-ray bursts from the nuclei of nearby low-mass galaxies typically lasting about one hour and repeating every few. Their physical origin remains debated, although so-called impacts models in which a secondary orbiting body pierces through the accretion disc around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system are considered promising. In this work, we study the QPE timing properties of GSN 069, the first galactic nucleus in which QPEs were identified, primarily focusing on Observed minus Calculated (O-C) diagrams. The O-C data in GSN 069 are consistent with a super-orbital modulation on tens of days whose properties do not comply with the impacts model. We suggest that rigid precession of a misaligned accretion disc or, alternatively, the presence of a second SMBH forming a sub-milliparsec binary with the inner EMRI is needed to reconcile the model with the data. In both cases, the quiescent accretion disc emission should also be modulated on similar timescales. Current X-ray monitoring indicates that this might be the case, although a longer baseline of higher-cadence observations is needed to confirm the tentative X-ray flux periodicity on firm statistical grounds. Future dedicated monitoring campaigns will be crucial to test the overall impacts plus modulation model in GSN 069, and to distinguish between the two proposed modulating scenarios. If our interpretation is correct, QPEs in GSN 069 represent the first electromagnetic detection of a short-period EMRI system in an external galaxy, opening the way to future multi-messenger astronomical observations.

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Harmonic Analysis of the Pulsar Angular Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array observations have found evidence for an isotropic gravitational wave background with the Hellings-Downs angular correlations, expected from general relativity. This interpretation hinges on the measured shape of the angular correlations, which is predominately quadrupolar under general relativity. Here we explore a more flexible parameterization: we expand the angular correlations into a sum of Legendre polynomials and use a Bayesian analysis to constrain their coefficients with the 15-year pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). When including Legendre polynomials with multipoles $\ell \geq 2$, we only find a significant signal in the quadrupole with an amplitude consistent with general relativity and non-zero at the $\sim 95\%$ confidence level and a Bayes factor of 200. When we include multipoles $\ell \leq 1$, the Bayes factor evidence for quadrupole correlations decreases by more than an order of magnitude due to evidence for a monopolar signal at approximately 4 nHz which has also been noted in previous analyses of the NANOGrav 15-year data. Further work needs to be done in order to better characterize the properties of this monopolar signal and its effect on the evidence for quadrupolar angular correlations.</description>

      <title>Stability in Cubic Metric-Affine Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the stability issue of the vector and axial modes of the torsion and nonmetricity tensors around general backgrounds in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity. We show that the presence of cubic order invariants defined from the curvature, torsion and nonmetricity tensors allow the cancellation of the well-known instabilities arising in the vector and axial sectors of quadratic Metric-Affine Gravity. For the resulting theory, we also obtain Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole solutions with dynamical torsion and nonmetricity, which in general include massive tensor modes for these quantities, thus avoiding further no-go theorems that potentially prevent a consistent interaction of massless higher spin fields in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>The Composite Spectral Energy Distribution of Quasars is Surprisingly Universal Since Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), we construct mean/median spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for unique bright quasars in redshift bins of 0.2 and up to $z \simeq 3$, after taking the GALEX non-detection into account. Further correcting for the absorption of the intergalactic medium, these mean/median quasar SEDs constitute a surprisingly redshift-independent mean/median composite SED from the rest-frame optical down to $\simeq 500~{\rm \mathring A}$ for quasars with bolometric luminosity brighter than $10^{45.5}~{\rm erg s^{-1}}$. Moreover, the mean/median composite quasar SED is plausibly also independent of black hole mass and Eddington ratio, and suggests similar properties of dust and gas in the quasar host galaxies since cosmic noon. Both the mean and median composite SEDs are nicely consistent with previous mean composite quasar spectra at wavelengths beyond $\simeq 1000~{\rm \mathring A}$, but at shorter wavelengths, are redder, indicating, on average, less ionizing radiation than previously expected. Through comparing the model-predicted to the observed composite quasar SEDs, we favor a simply truncated disk model, rather than a standard thin disk model, for the quasar central engine, though we request more sophisticated disk models. Future deep ultraviolet facilities, such as the China Space Station Telescope and the Ultraviolet Explorer, would prompt revolutions in many aspects, including the quasar central engine, production of the broad emission lines in quasars, and cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing the ringdown signal of GW150914 using the F-statistic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a gravitational wave (GW) signal from a binary black hole merger provides valuable insights into the properties of the final black hole and serves as a critical test of general relativity in the strong-field regime. A key aspect of this investigation is to determine whether the first overtone mode exists in real GW data, as its presence would offer significant implications for our understanding of general relativity under extreme conditions. To address this, we conducted a reanalysis of the ringdown signal from GW150914, using the newly proposed F-statistic method to search for the first overtone mode. Our results are consistent with those obtained through classical time-domain Bayesian inference, indicating that there is no evidence of the first overtone mode in the ringdown signal of GW150914. However, our results show the potentiality of utilizing the F-statistic methodology to unearth nuanced features within GW signals, thereby contributing novel insights into black hole properties.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of subcritical fast magnetosonic shock boundaries caused by shock reformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of a deformed subcritical fast magnetosonic shock front is compared between two two-dimensional PIC simulations with different orientations of the magnetic field relative to the simulation box. All other initial and simulation conditions are kept identical. Shock boundary oscillations are observed in the simulation where the magnetic field direction is resolved. This oscillation is caused by the reformation of the shock front. One part of the front acts as a shock, while the other functions as a magnetic piston, with both halves changing their states in antiphase. The oscillation period corresponds to the time required for one shock wave to grow as the other collapses. In contrast, the corrugated fast magnetosonic shock does not oscillate in the second simulation, where the magnetic field is oriented out of the simulation plane. This dependence on magnetic field orientation suggests that the shock oscillation is induced by magnetic tension, which is only effective in the first simulation. In both simulations, the shock perturbation does not grow over time, indicating that the shocks are stable. The potential relevance of these findings for the Alfv\'enic oscillations of the supercritical Earth's bow shock, detected by the MMS multi-spacecraft mission, is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show for the first time that rotating wormholes are capable of emitting a Poynting flux in the process of accreting magnetized matter. To this end, we analyze the Damour-Solodukhin metric describing a Kerr-type wormhole and calculate the electromagnetic flux assuming a specific geometry for the magnetic field contained by the wormhole ergosphere. We find that for highly rotating wormholes a mechanism similar to that of Blandford and Znajek is possible, and the emitted electromagnetic flux is of the same order as for a Kerr black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate electromagnetic and gravitational radiation generated during a process of the tidal stripping of a white dwarf star circulating a black hole. We model a white dwarf star by a Bose-Fermi droplet and use the quantum hydrodynamic equations to simulate evolution of a black hole-white dwarf binary system. While going through the periastron, the white dwarf loses a small fraction of its mass. The mass falling onto a black hole is a source of powerful electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. Bursts of ultraluminous radiation are flared at each periastron passage. This resembles the recurrent flaring of X-ray sources discovered recently by Irwin {\it et al.}. Gravitational energy bursts occur mainly through emission at very low frequencies. The accretion disc, formed due to stripping of a white dwarf, starts at some point to contribute continuously to radiation of both electromagnetic and gravitational types.</description>

      <title>Physical Models for the Astrophysical Population of Black Holes: Application to the Bump in the Mass Distribution of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of binary black holes have revealed unexpected structure in the black hole mass distribution. Previous studies of the mass distribution employ physically-motivated phenomenological models and infer the parameters that directly control the features of the mass distribution that are allowed in their model, associating the constraints on those parameters with their physical motivations. In this work, we take an alternative approach in which we introduce a model parameterizing the underlying stellar and core-collapse physics and obtaining the remnant black hole distribution as a derived byproduct. In doing so, we directly constrain the stellar physics necessary to explain the astrophysical distribution of black hole properties under a given model. We apply this approach to modeling the mapping between stellar core mass and remnant black hole mass, including the effects of mass loss due to the pulsational pair instability supernova (PPISN) process, which has been proposed as an explanation for the observed excess of black holes at $\sim 35 M_\odot$. Placing constraints on the nuclear reaction rates necessary to explain the PPISN parameters, we conclude that the peak observed at $\sim 35 M_\odot$ is highly unlikely to be a signature from the PPISN process. This procedure can be applied to modeling any physical process that underlies the astrophysical mass distribution. Allowing the parameters of the core-remnant mass relationship to evolve with redshift permits correlated and physically reasonable changes in the location, shape, and amplitude of features in the mass function. We find that the current data are consistent with no redshift evolution in the core-remnant mass relationship, but ultimately place only weak constraints on the change of these parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first multidimensional fluid simulations of thermonuclear helium ignition underneath a hydrogen-rich shell. This situation is relevant to Type I X-ray bursts on neutron stars that accrete from a hydrogen-rich companion. Using the low Mach number fluid code MAESTROeX, we investigate the growth of the convection zone due to nuclear burning, and the evolution of the chemical abundances in the atmosphere of the star. We also examine the convective boundary mixing processes that cause the evolution to differ significantly from previous one-dimensional simulations that rely on mixing-length theory. We find that the convection zone grows outwards as penetrating fluid elements cool the overlying radiative layer, rather than directly from the increasing entropy of the convection zone itself. Simultaneously, these flows efficiently mix composition, carrying carbon out of, and protons into the convection zone even before contact with the hydrogen shell. We discuss the implications of these effects for future modeling of these events and observations.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos with gravitational wave and $\gamma$-ray burst joint observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to detect them. Future gravitational wave (GW) observations can precisely measure absolute cosmological distances, helping to break parameter degeneracies generated by traditional cosmological observations. This advancement can lead to much tighter constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. This work provides a preliminary forecast for detecting sterile neutrinos using third-generation GW detectors in combination with future short $\gamma$-ray burst observations from a THESEUS-like telescope, an approach not previously explored in the literature. Both massless and massive sterile neutrinos are considered within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that using GW data can greatly enhance the detection capability for massless sterile neutrinos, reaching 3$\sigma$ level. For massive sterile neutrinos, GW data can also greatly assist in improving the parameter constraints, but it seems that effective detection is still not feasible.</description>

      <title>A NICER View of PSR J1231$-$1411: A Complex Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent constraints on neutron star mass and radius have advanced our understanding of the equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter. Some of them have been obtained by modeling the pulses of three millisecond X-ray pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Here, we present a Bayesian parameter inference for a fourth pulsar, PSR J1231$-$1411, using the same technique with NICER and XMM-Newton data. When applying a broad mass-inclination prior from radio timing measurements and the emission region geometry model that can best explain the data, we find likely converged results only when using a limited radius prior. If limiting the radius to be consistent with the previous observational constraints and EOS analyses, we infer the radius to be $12.6 \pm 0.3$ km and the mass to be $1.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05}$ $M_\odot$, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the $16\,\%$ and $84\,\%$ quantiles. If using an uninformative prior but limited between $10$ and $14$ km, we find otherwise similar results, but $R_{\mathrm{eq}} = 13.5_{-0.5}^{+0.3}$ km for the radius. In both cases, we find a nonantipodal hot region geometry where one emitting spot is at the equator or slightly above, surrounded by a large colder region, and where a noncircular hot region lies close to southern rotational pole. If using a wider radius prior, we only find solutions that fit the data significantly worse. We discuss the challenges in finding the better fitting solutions, possibly related to the weak interpulse feature in the pulse profile.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectro-polarimetric characterization of GX 340+0 in the horizontal branch: a highly inclined source?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first detection of X-ray polarization in the horizontal branch for GX 340+0 as obtained by Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). A polarization degree of 4.3%$\pm$0.3% is obtained. This value is in agreement with the previous polarization measurements of Z-sources in the horizontal branch. Spectro-polarimetric analysis, performed using a broad-band spectral model obtained by NICER and NuSTAR quasi-simultaneous observations, allowed us to constrain the polarization for the soft and hard spectral components typical to these sources. The polarization angle for the two components differs by ${\sim}40{\deg}$. This result could be explained by a misalignment of the NS rotations axis with respect to the accretion disk axis. We provide a comparison of the results with polarization expected in different models. Theoretical expectations for the polarization of the disk and the Comptonization components favor an orbital inclination for GX 340+0 higher than 60{\deg}, as expected for Cyg-like sources, in contrast with results we report for the reflection component using broad-band spectrum.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays from Neutrino-Emitting Tidal Disruption Events</title>

Abstract: We revisit the Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECRs) production in Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) in the light of recent neutrino-TDE associations. We use an isotropically emitting source-propagation model, which has been developed to describe the neutrino production in AT2019dsg, AT2019fdr, and AT2019aalc. These TDEs have strong dust echoes in the infrared range, which are potentially linked with the neutrino production. A mechanism where neutrinos originate from cosmic ray scattering on infrared photons implies cosmic rays in the ultra-high energy range, thus suggesting a natural connection with the observed UHECR. We extrapolate the three TDE associations to a population of neutrino- and UHECR-emitting TDEs, and postulate that these TDEs power the UHECRs. We then infer the source composition, population parameters, and local rates that are needed to describe UHECR data. We find that UHECR data point towards a mix of light to mid-heavy injection isotopes, which could be found, e.g., in oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, and to a contribution of at least two groups of TDEs with different characteristics, dominated by AT2019aalc-type events. The required local TDE rates of ${\mathcal O}(10^2)~\mathrm{Gpc^{-3} \, yr^{-1}}$, however, are more indicative of the disruption of main sequence stars. We propose an enhanced efficiency in the acceleration of heavier nuclei that could address this discrepancy. The predicted diffuse neutrino fluxes suggest a population of astrophysical neutrino sources that can be observed by future radio neutrino detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength coverage of the 2024 periastron passage of PSR B1259-63 / LS 2883</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PSR B1259-63 is a gamma-ray binary system with a 48 ms radio pulsar orbiting around an O9.5Ve star, LS 2883, in a highly eccentric ~3.4 yr long orbit. Close to the periastron the system is detected from radio up to the TeV energies due to the interaction of LS 2883 and pulsar's outflows. The observations of last 4 periastra passages taken in 2010-2021 demonstrate periastron to periastron variability at all wavelength, probably linked to the state of the decretion disk. In this paper we present the results of our optical, radio and X-ray observational campaigns on PSR B1259-63 performed in 2024 accompanied with the analysis of the publicly available GeV FERMI/LAT data. We show that this periastron passage was characterised by the early flaring of X-rays before the periastron passage and GeV emission after the periastron passage, which can be explained by a larger size of the decretion disk as supported by the optical observations. The structure of the GeV flare is also in agreement with the disruption of the large dense disk. The possible X-ray/radio correlation was observed only during the post-periastron rise of X-ray and radio emission.</description>

      <title>Sibling Rivalry: Thermonuclear Diversity and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogeneity is the hallmark of standard candle-based cosmology investigations. Thermonuclear supernovae (Type-Ia, SNeIa) violate this essential requirement if they develop along multiple evolutionary pathways. In this work, the impact of thermonuclear diversity on cosmological parameter constraints is quantified using Pantheon+, one of the largest ensembles of SNeIa compiled to probe cosmology to date. Evidence of diversity is encoded in supernova light curves. Pantheon+ is shown to be diverse, with features indicative of multiple thermonuclear sub-classes. Diversity-driven systematic effects have been quantified on a supernova-by-supernova basis; event selections based on light curve-derived metrics were subsequently used to characterize diversity-dependent trends and mitigate their impact. A "diversity free" estimate of the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre parameter, $H_0$=$67.5\pm3.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (68\% C.L.), was obtained by reanalyzing Pantheon+. The Hubble Tension, an apparent disparity between early- and late-Universe determinations of $H_0$, is eased from $\sim$$5\sigma$ to $&lt;$$1\sigma$ after accounting for the diverse thermonuclear scenarios that govern SNeIa. A strategy for precise determination of $H_0$, dominated by statistical rather than systematic uncertainties, is also presented.</description>

      <title>Systematics in tests of general relativity using LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.</description>
