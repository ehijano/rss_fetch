      <title>HD 119130 b is not an "ultra-dense" sub-Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a revised mass measurement for HD 119130 b (aka K2-292 b), a transiting planet ($P = 17$ days, $R_\mathrm{p} = 2.63^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ $R_\mathrm{\oplus}$) orbiting a chromospherically inactive G dwarf, previously thought to be one of the densest sub-Neptunes known. Our follow-up Doppler observations with HARPS, HARPS-N, and HIRES reveal that HD 119130 b is, in fact, nearly one-third as massive as originally suggested by its initial confirmation paper. Our revised analysis finds $M_\mathrm{p} = 8.8 \pm 3.2$ $M_\mathrm{\oplus}$ ($M_\mathrm{p} &lt; 15.4$ $M_\mathrm{\oplus}$ at 98\% confidence) compared to the previously reported $M_\mathrm{p} = 24.5 \pm 4.4$ $M_\mathrm{\oplus}$. While the true cause of the original mass measurement's inaccuracy remains uncertain, we present the plausible explanation that the planet's radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude was inflated due to constructive interference with a second, untreated sinusoidal signal in the data (possibly rotational modulation from the star). HD 119130 b illustrates the complexities of interpreting the RV orbits of small transiting planets. While RV mass measurements of such planets may be precise, they are not necessarily guaranteed to be accurate. This system serves as a cautionary tale as observers and theorists alike look to the exoplanet mass-radius diagram for insights into the physics of small planet formation.</description>

      <title>The impact of observing cadence and undetected companions on the accuracy of planet mass measurements from radial velocity monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct experiments on both real and synthetic radial velocity (RV) data to quantify the impact that observing cadence, the number of RV observations, and undetected companions all have on the accuracy of small planet mass measurements. We run resampling experiments on four systems with small transiting planets and substantial public data from HIRES in order to explore how degrading observing cadence and the number of RVs affects the planets' mass measurement relative to a baseline value. From these experiments, we recommend that observers obtain 2--3 RVs per orbit of the inner-most planet and acquire at minimum 40 RVs. Following these guidelines, we then conduct simulations using synthetic RVs to explore the impact of undetected companions and untreated red noise on the masses of planets with known orbits. While undetected companions generally do not bias the masses of known planets, in some cases, when coupled with an inadequate observing baseline, they can cause the mass of an inner transiting planet to be systematically overestimated on average.</description>

      <title>On the local formation of the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of seven ~Earth-mass planets, orbiting the 0.09 solar mass M-Dwarf TRAPPIST-1 captivated the public and sparked a proliferation of investigations into the system's origins. Among other properties, the resonant architecture of the planets has been interpreted to imply that orbital migration played a dominant role in the system's early formation. If correct, this hypothesis could imply that all of the seven worlds formed far from the star, and might harbor enhanced inventories of volatile elements. However, multiple factors also contradict this interpretation. In particular, the planets' apparent rocky compositions and non-hierarchical mass distribution might evidence them having formed closer to their current orbital locations. In this paper, we investigate the latter possibility with over 600 accretion simulations that model the effects of collisional fragmentation. In addition to producing multiple TRAPPIST-like configurations, we experiment with a number of different models for tracking the evolution of the planets' volatile contents and bulk iron-to-silicate ratios. We conclude that a trend in bulk iron contents is the more likely explanation for the observed radial trend of decreasing uncompressed densities in the real system. Given the degree of radial mixing that occurs in our simulations, in most cases we find that all seven planets finish with similar volatile contents. Another confounding quality of the TRAPPIST-1 system is the fact that the innermost planets are not in first-order resonances with one-another. By applying a tidal migration model to our most promising accretion model results, we demonstrate cases where higher-order resonances are populated.</description>

      <title>Deep operator neural network applied to efficient computation of asteroid surface temperature and the Yarkovsky effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface temperature distribution is crucial for thermal property-based studies about irregular asteroids in our Solar System. While direct numerical simulations could model surface temperatures with high fidelity, they often take a significant amount of computational time, especially for problems where temperature distributions are required to be repeatedly calculated. To this end, deep operator neural network (DeepONet) provides a powerful tool due to its high computational efficiency and generalization ability. In this work, we applied DeepONet to the modelling of asteroid surface temperatures. Results show that the trained network is able to predict temperature with an accuracy of ~1% on average, while the computational cost is five orders of magnitude lower, hence enabling thermal property analysis in a multidimensional parameter space. As a preliminary application, we analyzed the orbital evolution of asteroids through direct N-body simulations embedded with instantaneous Yarkovsky effect inferred by DeepONet-based thermophysical modelling.Taking asteroids (3200) Phaethon and (89433) 2001 WM41 as examples, we show the efficacy and efficiency of our AI-based approach.</description>

      <title>NEOviz: Uncertainty-Driven Visual Analysis of Asteroid Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NEOviz, an interactive visualization system designed to assist planetary defense experts in the visual analysis of the movements of near-Earth objects in the Solar System that might prove hazardous to Earth. Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.</description>

      <title>ALMA and GMRT Studies of Dust Continuum Emission and Spectral Lines Toward Oort Cloud Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic and molecular compounds of cometary ices serve as valuable knowledge into the chemical and physical properties of the outer solar nebula, where comets are formed. From the cometary atmospheres, the atoms and gas-phase molecules arise mainly in three ways: (i) the outgassing from the nucleus, (ii) the photochemical process, and (iii) the sublimation of icy grains from the nucleus. In this paper, we present the radio and millimeter wavelength observation results of Oort cloud non-periodic comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) band L and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6. We do not detect continuum emissions and an emission line of atomic hydrogen (HI) at rest frequency 1420 MHz from this comet using the GMRT. Based on ALMA observations, we detect the dust continuum emission and rotational emission lines of methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) from comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF). From the dust continuum emission, the activity of dust production (Af$\rho$) of comet ZTF is 2280$\pm$50 cm. Based on LTE spectral modelling, the column density and excitation temperature of CH$_{3}$OH towards C/2022 E3 (ZTF) are (4.50$\pm$0.25)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 70$\pm$3 K. The integrated emission maps show that CH$_{3}$OH was emitted from the coma region of the comet. The production rate of CH$_{3}$OH towards C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is (7.32$\pm$0.64)$\times$10$^{26}$ molecules s$^{-1}$. The fractional abundance of CH$_{3}$OH with respect to H$_{2}$O in the coma of the comet is 1.52%. We also compare our derived abundance of CH$_{3}$OH with the existence modelled value, and we see the observed and modelled values are nearly similar. We claim that CH$_{3}$OH is formed via the subsequential hydrogenation of formaldehyde (H$_{2}$CO) on the grain surface of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF).</description>

      <title>JWST COMPASS: The first near- to mid-infrared transmission spectrum of the hot super-Earth L 168-9 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first broadband near- to mid-infrared (3-12 microns) transmission spectrum of the highly-irradiated (T_eq = 981 K) M dwarf rocky planet L 168-9 b (TOI-134 b) observed with the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments aboard JWST. We measure the near-infrared transit depths to a combined median precision of 20 ppm across the three visits in 54 spectroscopic channels with uniform widths of 60 pixels (~0.2 microns wide; R~100), and the mid-infrared transit depths to 61 ppm median precision in 48 wavelength bins (~0.15 microns wide; R~50). We compare the transmission spectrum of L 168-9 b to a grid of 1D thermochemical equilibrium forward models, and rule out atmospheric metallicities of less than 100x solar (mean molecular weights &lt;4 g mol$^{-1}$) to 3-sigma confidence assuming high surface pressure (&gt;1 bar), cloudless atmospheres. Based on photoevaporation models for L 168-9 b with initial atmospheric mass fractions ranging from 2-100%, we find that this planet could not have retained a primordial H/He atmosphere beyond the first 200 Myr of its lifetime. Follow-up MIRI eclipse observations at 15 microns could make it possible to confidently identify a CO2-dominated atmosphere on this planet if one exists.</description>

      <title>Insights into Lunar Mineralogy: An Unsupervised Approach for Clustering of the Moon Mineral Mapper (M3) spectral data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for mapping spectral features of the Moon using machine learning-based clustering of hyperspectral data from the Moon Mineral Mapper (M3) imaging spectrometer. The method uses a convolutional variational autoencoder to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data and extract features of the spectra. Then, a k-means algorithm is applied to cluster the latent variables into five distinct groups, corresponding to dominant spectral features, which are related to the mineral composition of the Moon's surface. The resulting global spectral cluster map shows the distribution of the five clusters on the Moon, which consist of a mixture of, among others, plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, and Fe-bearing minerals across the Moon's surface. The clusters are compared to the mineral maps from the Kaguya mission, which showed that the locations of the clusters overlap with the locations of high wt% of minerals such as plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and olivine. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of unbiased unsupervised learning for lunar mineral exploration and provides a comprehensive analysis of lunar mineralogy.</description>

      <title>SPIRou observations of the young planet-hosting star PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents near-infrared spectropolarimetric and velocimetric observations of the young planet-hosting T Tauri star PDS 70, collected with SPIRou at the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope from 2020 to 2024. Clear Zeeman signatures from magnetic fields at the surface of PDS 70 are detected in our data set of 40 circularly polarized spectra. Longitudinal fields inferred from Zeeman signatures, ranging from -116 to 176 G, are modulated on a timescale of 3.008$\pm$0.006 d, confirming that this is the rotation period of PDS 70. Applying Zeeman-Doppler imaging to subsets of unpolarized and circularly polarised line profiles, we show that PDS 70 hosts low-contrast brightness spots and a large-scale magnetic field in its photosphere, featuring in particular a dipole component of strength 200-420 G that evolves on a timescale of months. From the broadening of spectral lines, we also infer that PDS 70 hosts a small-scale field of 2.51$\pm$0.12 kG. Radial velocities derived from unpolarized line profiles are rotationally modulated as well, and exhibit additional longer-term chromatic variability, most likely attributable to magnetic activity rather than to a close-in giant planet (with a 3sigma upper limit on its minimum mass of ~4 Mjup at a distance of ~0.2 au). We finally confirm that accretion occurs at the surface of PDS 70, generating modulated red-shifted absorption in the 1083.3-nm He i triplet, and show that the large-scale magnetic field, often strong enough to disrupt the inner accretion disc up to the corotation radius, weakens as the star gets fainter and redder (as in 2022), suggesting that dust from the disc more easily penetrates the stellar magnetosphere in such phases.</description>

      <title>Novel Simulation Framework for Analyzing Cosmic Ray Particle Distributions at a Global Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray measurements have inspired numerous interesting applications over several decades worldwide. These applications encompass non-invasive cosmic ray muon tomography, which enables the imaging of concealed dense objects or structures, the monitoring of area-averaged soil moisture with cosmic ray neutrons in agriculture and climate studies, real-time monitoring of the dynamical changes of the space and earth weather, etc. The demand for a quantitative characterization of cosmic ray shower particles near the Earth's surface is substantial, as it provides realistic particle spectra and rates for these diverse applications. In this study, we introduce Earth Cosmic Ray Shower (ECRS), a GEANT4-based software designed to simulate cosmic ray particle interactions in the atmosphere. ECRS incorporates the U.S. Standard Atmospheric Model and integrates a time-dependent geomagnetic field based on the Tsyganenko and IGRF models. Additionally, we present two case studies illustrating variations in the location-dependent average particle energy for muons, electrons, neutrons, and gammas at sea level. An outlook of this project is provided toward the conclusion.</description>

      <title>paired: A Statistical Framework for Detecting Stellar Binarity with Gaia RVs. I. Sensitivity to Unresolved Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data Release 3 (DR3) from the Gaia Mission includes radial velocity measurements of over 33 million targets. Among many scientific applications, the overlap of this stellar sample with targeted exoplanet transit survey stars presents an opportunity to understand planet occurrence in the context of stellar multiplicity on a large scale. Yet, any interpretation of occurrence relies upon an understanding of survey sensitivity. While the sensitivity to planets in transit surveys is well understood, a characterization of the sensitivity of Gaia to unresolved binaries is also critical. We describe here a statistical framework called paired, which we developed to enable the forward modeling of Gaia radial velocity observables for large samples of stars. The paired machinery links the reported radial velocity noise for a given star from Gaia to the probability of a spatially unresolved stellar companion. We demonstrate how this enables the user, given an observed distribution of individual binary ``probabilities" for a set of stars, to understand this distribution within the sensitivity limits of Gaia. For the subset of stars with the highest probability of excess radial velocity noise, we describe the ability of paired to constrain the semi-amplitude of the stellar binary. Where possible, we benchmark our inferred radial velocity semi-amplitudes against those from ground-based radial velocity surveys, and the subset published by Gaia DR3 itself. We aim for paired to be a community tool for the exploration of the effects of binarity on planets at a population level, but also for any user interested in stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries in the simulated ozone distribution on TRAPPIST-1e due to orography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TRAPPIST-1e is a tidally locked rocky exoplanet orbiting the habitable zone of an M dwarf star. Upcoming observations are expected to reveal new rocky exoplanets and their atmospheres around M dwarf stars. To interpret these future observations we need to model the atmospheres of such exoplanets. We configured CESM2-WACCM6, a chemistry climate model, for the orbit and stellar irradiance of TRAPPIST-1e assuming an initial Earth-like atmospheric composition. Our aim is to characterize the possible ozone (O$_3$) distribution and explore how this is influenced by the atmospheric circulation shaped by orography, using the Helmholtz wind decomposition and meridional mass streamfunction. The model included Earth-like orography and the substellar point was located over the Pacific Ocean. For such a scenario, our analysis reveals a North-South asymmetry in the simulated O$_3$ distribution. The O$_3$ concentration is highest at pressures $&gt;$ 10 hPa (below $\sim$30 km) near the South Pole. This asymmetry arises from the higher landmass fraction in the Northern Hemisphere, which causes drag in near-surface flows and leads to an asymmetric meridional overturning circulation. Catalytic species were roughly symmetrically distributed and were not found to be primary driver for the O$_3$ asymmetry. The total ozone column (TOC) density was higher for TRAPPIST-1e compared to Earth, with 8000 Dobson Units (DU) near the South Pole and 2000 DU near the North Pole. The results emphasise the sensitivity of O$_3$ to model parameters, illustrating how incorporating Earth-like orography can affect atmospheric dynamics and O$_3$ distribution. This link between surface features and atmospheric dynamics underlines the importance of how changing model parameters used to study exoplanet atmospheres can influence the interpretation of observations.</description>
