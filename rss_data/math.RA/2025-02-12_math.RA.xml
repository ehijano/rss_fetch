      <title>A Note on Strongly $\pi$-Regular Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{M}_m(S)$, where $S$ is a commutative ring and $m&gt;1$. For a positive integer $n$ if $A^n \mathbb{M}_m(S)= A^{n+1}\mathbb{M}_m(S)$, then we prove that $\mathbb{M}_m(S)A^n = \mathbb{M}_m(S)A^{n+1}$. For $n = 1$ this validates a recent conjecture [3, Conjecture 3.7].</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional module factorizations and complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce higher-dimensional module factorizations associated to a regular sequence. They include higher-dimensional matrix factorizations, which are commutative cubes consisting of free modules with edges being classical matrix factorizations. We characterize the stable category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over a complete intersection via higher-dimensional matrix factorizations over the corresponding regular local ring. The result generalizes to noncommutative rings, including quantum complete intersections.</description>

      <title>The Affine Tamari Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a fixed integer $n\geq 2$, we construct two new finite lattices that we call the cyclic Tamari lattice and the affine Tamari lattice. The cyclic Tamari lattice is a sublattice and a quotient lattice of the cyclic Dyer lattice, which is the infinite lattice of translation-invariant total orders under containment of inversion sets. The affine Tamari lattice is a quotient of the Dyer lattice, which in turn is a quotient of the cyclic Dyer lattice and is isomorphic to the collection of biclosed sets of the root system of type $\widetilde{A}_{n-1}$ under inclusion. We provide numerous combinatorial and algebraic descriptions of these lattices using translation-invariant total orders, translation-invariant binary in-ordered trees, noncrossing arc diagrams, torsion classes, triangulations, and translation-invariant noncrossing partitions. The cardinalities of the cyclic and affine Tamari lattices are the Catalan numbers of types $B_n$ and $D_n$, respectively. We show that these lattices are self-dual and semidistributive, and we describe their decompositions coming from the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Semidistributive Lattices. We also show that the rowmotion operators on these lattices have well-behaved orbit structures, which we describe via the cyclic sieving phenomenon. Our new combinatorial framework allows us to prove that the lengths of maximal green sequences for the completed path algebra of the oriented $n$-cycle are precisely the integers in the interval $[2n-1,\binom{n+1}{2}]$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Reed-Solomon codes and nonlinear skew quasi-cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article begins with an exploration of nonlinear codes ($\mathbb{F}_q$-linear subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n$) which are generalizations of the familiar Reed-Solomon codes. This then leads to a wider exploration of nonlinear analogues of the skew quasi-cyclic codes of index $\ell$ first explored in 2010 by Abualrub et al., i.e., $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}[x;\sigma]$-submodules of $\left(\mathbb{F}_{q^m}[x;\sigma]/(x^n - 1)\right)^\ell$. After introducing nonlinear skew quasi-cyclic codes, we then determine the module structure of these codes using a two-fold iteration of the Smith normal form of matrices over skew polynomial rings. Finally we show that in certain cases, a single use of the Smith normal form will suffice to determine the elementary divisors of the code.</description>

      <title>The categories of corings and coalgebras over a ring are locally countably presentable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02928v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any commutative ring $R$, we show that the categories of $R$-coalgebras and cocommutative $R$-coalgebras are locally $\aleph_1$-presentable, while the categories of $R$-flat $R$-coalgebras are $\aleph_1$-accessible. Similarly, for any associative ring $R$, the category of $R$-corings is locally $\aleph_1$-presentable, while the category of $R$-$R$-bimodule flat $R$-corings is $\aleph_1$-accessible. The cardinality of the ring $R$ can be arbitrarily large. We also discuss $R$-corings with surjective counit and flat kernel. The proofs are straightforward applications of an abstract category-theoretic principle going back to Ulmer. For right or two-sided $R$-module flat $R$-corings, our cardinality estimate for the accessibility rank is not as good. A generalization to comonoid objects in accessible monoidal categories is also considered.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian extensions and automorphisms of post-Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16289v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concepts of crossed modules of post-Lie algebras and cat^1-post-Lie algebras. It is proved that these two concepts are equivalent to each other. We also construct a non-abelian cohomology for post-Lie algebras to classify their nonabelian extensions. At last, we investigate the inducibility of a pair of automorphisms for post-Lie algebras and construct a Wells-type exact sequence.</description>

      <title>From t-Product to t-STP of Cubic Matrices With Application to Hyper-Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the perspective of dynamic (control) systems over cubic matrices, this paper proposes some new products on cubic matrices and uses them to construct linear and nonlinear control systems over cubic matrices. First, the t-product of cubic matrices is surveyed, and some algebraic properties are investigated. When t-product based dynamic (control) systems are considered, its two weaknesses are found as follows: (i) it has rigorous dimension restriction; (ii) it is unable to formulate nonlinear (control) systems. Then the dimension keeping semi-tensor product (DK-STP) of cubic matrices is proposed, which overcomes the aforementioned weaknesses. Unfortunately, all subsystems, corresponding to every frontal slides, of a DK-STP based dynamic (control) system are decoupled, which makes it unsuitable for formulating systems with coupled subsystems. Finally, the t-STP, a combination of t-product with DK-STP, is presented. The t-STP related algebraic structures over cubic matrices, such as group, ring, module, and Lie group/Lie algebra, etc. are investigated. Finally, t-STP based dynamic (control) systems over cubic matrices are obtained, and its application to hyper-networked evolutionary games is investigated.</description>

      <title>On GK Dimension and Generator Bounds for a Class of Graded Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textit{monotonic algebras}, a broad class of algebras that includes all Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension at most four, as well as algebras with \textit{pure} resolutions, such as Koszul and piecewise Koszul algebras. We show that the Gelfand-Kirillov (GK) dimension of these algebras is bounded above by their global dimension and establish a similar result for the minimal number of generators. Furthermore, we prove a parity theorem for Artin-Schelter regular algebras, demonstrating that the difference between their global dimension and GK dimension is always an even integer.</description>

      <title>Novikov algebras in low dimension: identities, images and codimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polynomial identities of two-dimensional Novikov algebras are studied over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$. We determine minimal generating sets for the T-ideals of the polynomial identities and linear bases for the corresponding relatively free algebras. As a consequence, we establish that polynomial identities separate two-dimensional Novikov algebras, which are not associative. Namely, any two-dimensional Novikov algebras, which are not associative, are isomorphic if and only if they satisfy the same polynomial identities. Moreover, we obtain the codimension sequences of all these algebras. In particular, every two-dimensional Novikov algebra has at most linear growth of its codimension sequence. We explicitly describe multilinear images of every two-dimensional Novikov algebra. In particular, we show that these images are vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Integro-differential rings on species and derived structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the theory of species, differential as well as integral operators are known to arise in a natural way. In this paper, we shall prove that they precisely fit together in the algebraic framework of integro-differential rings, which are themselves an abstraction of classical calculus (incorporating its Fundamental Theorem). The results comprise (set) species as well as linear species. Localization of (set) species leads to the more general structure of modified integro-differential rings, previously employed in the algebraic treatment of Volterra integral equations. Furthermore, the ring homomorphism from species to power series via taking generating series is shown to be a (modified) integro-differential ring homomorphism. As an application, a topology and further algebraic operations are imported to virtual species from the general theory of integro-differential rings.</description>
