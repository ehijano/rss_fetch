      <title>Near-integral fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We abstract the study of irreducible characters of finite groups vanishing on all but two conjugacy classes, initiated by S. Gagola, to irreducible characters of fusion rings whose kernel has maximal rank. These near-integral fusion rings include the near-groups which are currently one of the most abundant sources of novel examples of fusion categories to date. We generalize many of the known results on near-group fusion categories from the literature to near-integral fusion categories and characterize when such categories are braided. In particular, braided near-integral fusion categories describe all braided fusion categories which are almost symmetrically braided. This novel result allows a digestible characterization of the over $300$ braided equivalence classes of premodular fusion categories of rank $6$ or less.</description>

      <title>Miura operators as R-matrices from M-brane intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that Miura operators are R-matrices of certain infinite-dimensional quantum algebras. We test our proposal by realizing Miura operators of $q$-deformed $W$- and $Y$-algebras in terms of R-matrices of the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$. Physically, the representations of this toroidal algebra arise from the algebra of local operators on M2-branes and M5-branes, in M-theory subject to an $\Omega$-background. We associate an R-matrix to each M2-M5 brane crossing, by studying its description as a gauge-invariant intersection of a topological line defect and a holomorphic surface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative Chern-Simons theory. The Miura transformation is engineered using multiple M2-M5 intersections, relying crucially on the properties of the underlying R-matrices. We thereby identify each R-matrix with a Miura operator. In a dual Type IIB frame, the components of the Miura transformation are shown to coincide with the half-index of a 3d supersymmetric gauge theory on a Hanany-Witten system of D3-NS5 branes. As a further application, we demonstrate that $qq$-characters can be algebraically constructed from the Miura transformation.</description>

      <title>Remarks on symmetric fusion categories of low rank in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give lower bounds for the rank of a symmetric fusion category in characteristic $p\geq 5$ in terms of $p$. We prove that the second Adams operation $\psi_2$ is not the identity for any non-trivial symmetric fusion category, and that symmetric fusion categories satisfying $\psi_2^a=\psi_2^{a-1}$ for some positive integer $a$ are super Tannakian. As an application, we classify all symmetric fusion categories of rank 3 and those of rank 4 with exactly two self dual simple objects.</description>

      <title>Unoriented 2-dimensional TQFTs and the category $\operatorname{Rep}(S_t\wr \mathbb Z_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a family of unoriented 2-dimensional cobordism theories parametrized by certain triples of sequences. We also prove that some specializations of these sequences yield equivalences with an exterior product of Deligne categories. In particular, one of these specializations recovers the generalized Deligne category $\operatorname{Rep}(S_t\wr \mathbb Z_2)$.</description>

      <title>Koszul Operads Governing Props and Wheeled Props</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct groupoid coloured operads governing props and wheeled props, and show they are Koszul. This is accomplished by new biased definitions for (wheeled) props, and an extension of the theory of Groebner bases for operads to apply to groupoid coloured operads. Using the Koszul machine, we define homotopy (wheeled) props, and show they are not formed by polytope based models. Finally, using homotopy transfer theory, we construct Massey products for (wheeled) props, show these products characterise the formality of these structures, and re-obtain a theorem of Mac Lane on the existence of higher homotopies of (co)commutative Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Anyon Condensation and Level-Rank Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive new dualities of topological quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions that generalize the familiar level-rank dualities of Chern-Simons gauge theories. The key ingredient in these dualities is non-abelian anyon condensation, which is a gauging operation for topological lines with non-group-like i.e. non-invertible fusion rules. We find that, generically, dualities involve such non-invertible anyon condensation and that this unifies a variety of exceptional phenomena in topological field theories and their associated boundary rational conformal field theories, including conformal embeddings, and Maverick cosets (those where standard algorithms for constructing a coset model fail.) We illustrate our discussion in a variety of isolated examples as well as new infinite series of dualities involving non-abelian anyon condensation including: i) a new description of the parafermion theory as $(SU(N)_{2} \times Spin(N)_{-4})/\mathcal{A}_{N},$ ii) a new presentation of a series of points on the orbifold branch of $c=1$ conformal field theories as $(Spin(2N)_{2} \times Spin(N)_{-2} \times Spin(N)_{-2})/\mathcal{B}_{N}$, and iii) a new dual form of $SU(2)_{N}$ as $(USp(2N)_{1} \times SO(N)_{-4})/\mathcal{C}_{N}$ arising from conformal embeddings, where $\mathcal{A}_{N}, \mathcal{B}_{N},$ and $\mathcal{C}_{N}$ are appropriate collections of gauged non-invertible bosons.</description>
