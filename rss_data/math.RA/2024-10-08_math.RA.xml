      <title>Spaces of Generators for Azumaya Algebras with Unitary Involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a finite dimensional algebra (possibly with some extra structure) over an infinite field $K$ and let $r\in\mathbb{N}$. The $r$-tuples $(a_1,\dots,a_r)\in A^r$ which fail to generate $A$ are the $K$-points of a closed subvariety $Z_r$ of the affine space underlying $A^r$, the codimension of which may be thought of as quantifying how well a generic $r$-tuple in $A^r$ generates $A$. Taking this intuition one step further, the second author, Reichstein and Williams showed that lower bounds on the codimension of $Z_r$ in $A^r$ (for every $r$) imply upper bounds on the number of generators of \emph{forms} of the $K$-algebra $A$ over finitely generated $K$-rings. That work also demonstrates how finer information on $Z_r$ may be used to construct forms of $A$ which require many elements to generate.
  The dimension and irreducible components of $Z_r$ are known in a few cases, which in particular lead to upper bounds on the number of generators of Azumaya algebras and Azumaya algebras with involution of the first kind (orthogonal or symplectic). This paper treats the case of Azumaya algebras with a unitary involution by finding the dimension and irreducible components of $Z_r$ when $A$ is the $K$-algebra with involution $(\mathrm{M}_n(K)\times \mathrm{M}_n(K), (a,b)\mapsto (b^{\mathrm{t}},a^{\mathrm{t}}))$. Our analysis implies that every Azumaya algebra with a unitary involution over a finitely generated $K$-ring of Krull dimension $d$ can be generated by $\lfloor \frac{d}{2n-2}+\frac{3}{2} \rfloor$ elements. We also give examples which require at least half that many elements to generate, by building on the work of the second author, Reichstein and Williams.
  Our method of finding the dimension and irreducible components of $Z_r$ actually applies to all $K$-algebras $A$ satisfying a mild assumption.</description>

      <title>Trees and spectra of Heyting algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A poset is Esakia representable when it is isomorphic to the prime spectrum of a Heyting algebra. Notably, every Esakia representable poset is also the spectrum of a commutative ring with unit. The problem of describing the Esakia representable posets was raised in 1985 and remains open to this day. We recall that a forest is a disjoint union of trees and that a root system is the order dual of a forest. It is shown that a root system is Esakia representable if and only if it satisfies a simple order theoretic condition, known as "having enough gaps", and each of its nonempty chains has an infimum. This strengthens Lewis's characterisation of the root systems which are spectra of commutative rings with unit. While a similar characterisation of arbitrary Esakia representable forests seems currently out of reach, we show that a well-ordered forest is Esakia representable if and only if it has enough gaps and each of its nonempty chains has a supremum.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between additive and monoidal categorifications with application to Grassmannian cluster categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on work of Derksen-Fei and Plamondon, we formulate a conjectural correspondence between additive and monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras, which reveals a new connection between the additive reachability conjecture and the multiplicative reachability conjecture. Evidence for this conjecture is provided by results on Grassmannian cluster algebras and categories in the tame types. Moreover, we give a construction of the generic kernels introduced by Hernandez and Leclerc for type $\mathbb{A}$ via the Grassmannian cluster categories. As an application of the correspondence, we construct rigid indecomposable modules and indecomposable non-rigid rigid modules in Grassmannian cluster categories.</description>

      <title>Post-groupoids and quiver-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of post-groups was introduced by Bai, Guo and the first two authors recently, which are the global objects corresponding to post-Lie algebras, equivalent to skew-left braces, and can be used to construct set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. In this paper, first we introduce the notion of post-groupoids, which consists of a group bundle and some other structures satisfying some compatibility conditions. Post-groupoids reduce to post-groups if the underlying base is one point. An action of a group on a set gives rise to the natural example of post-groupoids. We show that a post-groupoid gives rise to a groupoid (called the Grossman-Larson groupoid), and an action on the original group bundle. Then we introduce the notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators on a groupoid with respect to an action on a group bundle. A relative Rota-Baxter operator naturally gives rise to a post-groupoid and a matched pair of groupoids. One important application of post-groupoids is that they give rise to quiver-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation on the quiver underlying the Grossman-Larson groupoid. We also introduce the notion of a skew-left bracoid, which consists of a group bundle and a groupoid satisfying some compatibility conditions. A skew-left bracoid reduces to a skew-left brace if the underlying base is one point. We give the one-to-one correspondence between post-groupoids and skew-left bracoids. Finally, we show that post-Lie groupoids give rise to post-Lie algebroids via differentiation.</description>

      <title>Deformation maps in proto-twilled Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to find a unified approach to studying the cohomology theories of various operators on Leibniz algebras. We first introduce deformation maps in a proto-twilled Leibniz algebra to do this. Such maps generalize various well-known operators (such as homomorphisms, derivations, crossed homomorphisms, Rota-Baxter operators, modified Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators etc) defined on Leibniz algebras and embedding tensors on Lie algebras. We define the cohomology of a deformation map unifying the existing cohomologies of all the operators mentioned above. Then we construct a curved $L_\infty$-algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements are precisely deformation maps in a given proto-twilled Leibniz algebra. In particular, we get the Maurer-Cartan characterizations of modified Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators and Reynolds operators on a Leibniz algebra. Finally, given a proto-twilled Leibniz algebra and a deformation map $r$, we construct two governing $L_\infty$-algebras, the first one controls the deformations of the operator $r$ while the second one controls the simultaneous deformations of both the proto-twilled Leibniz algebra and the operator $r$.</description>

      <title>Finitistic dimensions over commutative DG-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the finitistic dimensions of commutative noetherian non-positive DG-rings with finite amplitude. We prove that any DG-module $M$ of finite flat dimension over such a DG-ring satisfies $\mathrm{projdim}_A(M) \leq \mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{H}^0 (A)) - \inf(M)$. We further provide explicit constructions of DG-modules with prescribed projective dimension and deduce that the big finitistic projective dimension satisfies the bounds $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{H}^0 (A)) - \mathrm{amp}(A) \leq \mathsf{FPD}(A) \leq \mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{H}^0(A))$. Moreover, we prove that DG-rings exist which achieve either bound. As a direct application, we prove new vanishing results for the derived Hochschild (co)homology of homologically smooth algebras.</description>

      <title>Composition and substitution of Regularity Structures B-series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Regularity Structures B-series which are used for describing solutions of singular stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). We define composition and substitutions of these B-series and as in the context of B-series for ordinary differential equations, these operations can be rewritten via products and Hopf algebras which have been used for building up renormalised models. These models provide a suitable topology for solving singular SPDEs. This new construction sheds a new light on these products and open interesting perspectives for the study of singular SPDEs in connection with B-series.</description>

      <title>Post Clifford semigroups, the Yang-Baxter equation, relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and dual weak left braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As generalizations of Rota--Baxter groups, Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups have been introduced by Catino, Mazzotta and Stefanelli in 2023. Based on their pioneering results, in this paper we first continue to study Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups. Inspired by the corresponding results in Rota--Baxter groups, we firstly obtain some properties and construction methods for Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups, and then study the substructures and quotient structures of these semigroups. On the other hand, as generalizations of post-groups, Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and braided groups, in this paper we introduce and investigate post Clifford semigroups, relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and braided Clifford semigroups, respectively. We prove that the categories of strong post Clifford semigroups, dual weak left braces, bijective strong relative Rota-Baxter Clifford semigroups and braided Clifford semigroups are mutually pairwise equivalent, and the category of post Clifford semigroups is equivalent to the category of bijective relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups, respectively. As a consequence, we prove that both post Clifford semigroups, relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and braided Clifford semigroups can provide set-theoretical solutions for the Yang--Baxter equation. The substructures and quotient structures of relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups are also considered.</description>

      <title>Perron similarities and the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP) is to determine which multisets of complex numbers occur as the spectrum of an entry-wise nonnegative matrix. Although there are some well-known necessary conditions, a solution to the NIEP is far from known.
  An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Johnson and Paparella developed the theory of real Perron similarities. Here, we fully develop the theory of complex Perron similarities.
  Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone and polytope of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). The extremals of these convex sets are finite in number, and their determination for each Perron similarity would solve the diagonalizable NIEP, a major portion of the entire problem. By considering Perron similarities of certain realizing matrices of Type I Karpelevich arcs, large portions of realizable spectra are generated for a given positive integer. This is demonstrated by producing a nearly complete geometrical representation of the spectra of $4 \times 4$ stochastic matrices.
  Similar to the Karpelevich region, it is shown that the subset of complex Euclidean space comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices is compact and star-shaped. Extremal elements of the set are defined and shown to be on the boundary.
  It is shown that the polyhedral cone and convex polytope of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix corresponds to the conical hull and convex hull of its rows, respectively. Similar results are established for multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and Walsh matrices. These polytopes are of great significance with respect to the NIEP because they are extremal in the region comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices.</description>
