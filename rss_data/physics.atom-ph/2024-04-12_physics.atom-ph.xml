      <title>Floquet engineering Rydberg sub-THz frequency comb spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering a Terahertz (THz) frequency comb spectroscopy at atomic level advances the precisely measurement in spectroscopy and sensing. Current progresses on THz frequency comb rely on difference-frequency generation, optical parametric oscillation, and other methods. Generating a THz frequency comb poses challenges in source stability and achieving a narrow bandwidth, which traditional THz devices are difficult to achieve. Furthermore, accurately measuring the generated THz frequency comb necessitates a high-performance THz detector. Rydberg atoms are well-suited for electric field sensing due to their ultra-wide radio frequency transition energy levels, making them especially sensitive to external electric fields in the DC to THz bandwidth. However, there have been no reports about generating THz frequency comb spectroscopy at the atomic level until now. This work presents a THz frequency comb spectroscopy with Rydberg atoms, in which a Floquet comb-like transition is engineered through a time-periodic drive field. Our approach simplifies the setup required for THz frequency comb spectroscopy while extending the working bandwidth for Rydberg atomic sensors. The THz frequency comb spectroscopy at the atomic level reported in this article shows great potential for various applications in astronomy, remote sensing, spectral detection of biological samples, and other related fields.</description>

      <title>Orders of Magnitude Improved Cyclotron-Mode Cooling for Non-Destructive Spin Quantum Transition Spectroscopy with Single Trapped Antiprotons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate efficient sub-thermal cooling of the modified cyclotron mode of a single trapped antiproton and reach particle temperatures $T_+=E_+/k_\text{B}$ below $200\,$mK in preparation times shorter than $500\,$s. This corresponds to the fastest resistive single-particle cyclotron cooling to sub-thermal temperatures ever demonstrated. By cooling trapped particles to such low energies, we demonstrate the detection of antiproton spin transitions with an error-rate $&lt;0.000025$, more than three orders of magnitude better than in previous best experiments. This method will have enormous impact on multi-Penning-trap experiments that measure magnetic moments with single nuclear spins for tests of matter/antimatter symmetry, high-precision mass-spectrometry, and measurements of electron $g$-factors bound to highly-charged ions that test quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Highly spin-polarized molecules via collisional microwave pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general technique to produce cold spin-polarized molecules, in which rotationally excited states are first populated by coherent microwave excitation, and then allowed to spin-flip and relax via collisional quenching, which populates a single final spin state. We illustrate the high selectivity of the technique for $^{13}$C$^{16}$O molecules immersed in a cold buffer gas of helium atoms, achieving a high degree ($\geq$95\%) of nuclear spin polarization at 1 K.</description>

      <title>Hyperpolarisation Dynamics: Asymptotic Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For applications of solid state quantum computing and quantum simulations, high fidelity initialisation of thermally mixed electronic and nuclear spin qubits is essential. Whereas electronic spins can readily be initialised optically to high fidelity, initialisation of the nuclear spins requires alternative approaches, such as dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) via the electronic spin. Pulse-based DNP methods, such as PulsePol, are already widely utilised. By means of repeated application of PulsePol sequences, interspersed with re-initialisation of the electronic spin, high levels of nuclear polarisation -- termed hyperpolarisation -- have been achieved. From theoretical analysis of these protocols perfect nuclear initialisation is expected; however, in practice, saturation below $\sim$ 95$\%$ is seen in experiment. We develop an analytical model to describe hyperpolarisation dynamics, predicting non-maximal nuclear polarisation saturation in the asymptotic limit for realistic nuclear spin clusters. We argue that perfect initialisation of a typical nuclear cluster using this method may not, in general, be possible even with an arbitrarily large number of repetitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric top molecule YbOCH$_3$ is studied for its potential to $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violation searches. The influence of the rotations and vibrations of the YbOCH$_3$ on such violating effects as the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) and the scalar-pseudoscalar electron-nucleon interaction (Ne-SPS) is studied using the coupled channels method. The corresponding sensitivity parameters $E_{\rm eff}$ and $E_{\rm s}$ are computed.</description>

      <title>Time evolution as an optimization problem: The hydrogen atom in strong laser fields in a basis of time-dependent Gaussian wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in attosecond science have made it increasingly important to develop stable, reliable and accurate algorithms and methods to model the time evolution of atoms and molecules in intense laser fields. A key process in attosecond science is high-harmonic generation, which is challenging to model with fixed Gaussian basis sets, as it produces high-energy electrons, with a resulting rapidly varying and highly oscillatory wave function that extends over dozens of {\aa}ngstr\"om. Recently, Rothe's method, where time evolution is rephrased as an optimization problem, has been applied to the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. Here, we apply Rothe's method to the hydrogen wave function and demonstrate that complex-valued Gaussian wave packets with time-dependent width, center, and momentum parameters are able to reproduce spectra obtained from essentially exact grid calculations for high-harmonic generation with only 50-181 Gaussians for field strengths up to $5\times 10^{14}$W/cm$^2$. This paves the way for the inclusion of continuum contributions into real-time, time-dependent electronic-structure theory with Gaussian basis sets for strong fields, and eventually accurate simulations of the time evolution of molecules without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.</description>

      <title>Optical and Transport Properties of Plasma Mixtures from Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the charged particle transport properties of warm dense matter / hot dense plasma mixtures is a challenge for analytical models. High accuracy ab initio methods are more computationally expensive, but can provide critical insight by explicitly simulating mixtures. In this work, we investigate the transport properties and optical response of warm dense carbon-hydrogen mixtures at varying concentrations under either conserved electronic pressure or mass density at a constant temperature. We compare options for mixing the calculated pure species properties to estimate the results of the mixtures. We find that a combination of the Drude model with the Matthiessen's rule works well for DC electron transport and low frequency optical response. This breaks down at higher frequencies, where a volumetric mix of pure-species AC conductivities works better.</description>

      <title>Enhancing sensitivity of atomic microwave receiver combining laser arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atom,which exhibits a strong response to weak electric(E) fields,is regarded as a promising atomic receiver to surpass sensitivity of conventional receivers. However, its sensitivity is strongly limited by the noise coming from both classical and quantum levels and how to enhance it significantly remains challenging. Here we experimentally prove that the sensitivity of Rydberg atomic receiver can be increased to 23 nV/cm/Hz1/2 by combining laser arrays. Theoretically, we demonstrate that multiple beams illuminating on a PD perform better than multiple PDs for laser arrays.In our experiment,10 dB SNR enhancement is achieved by utilizing 2 * 2 probe beam arrays, compared to the performance of a laser beam,and it can be enhanced further just by adding a resonator. The results could offer an avenue for the design and optimization of ultrahigh-sensitivity Rydberg atomic receivers and promote applications in cosmology, meteorology, communication, and microwave quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Controlling high-harmonic generation from strain engineered monolayer phosphorene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phosphorene, a well-studied 2D allotrope of phosphorus, features unique properties such as widely tunable bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable intrinsic in-plane anisotropy. Utilizing these structural and electronic properties, we investigate ultrafast electron dynamics and high harmonic generation (HHG) from phosphorene subject to band structure engineering through external strain, based on ab initio time-dependent density-functional theory approach. We show that strong field processes in such systems can be optimized and controlled by biaxial tensile and compressive strain engineering, that results in electronic structure modification. While -10% strain resulted in closing of band gap, 2% strain increased the gap by 22% with respect to 0.9 eV in pristine phosphorene, consequently affecting the high harmonic yield. With reduction of gap, by applying strain from 2% to -10%, the valence band near $\Gamma-$point becomes more flat and discreet, resulting in large electronic density of states and enhanced electronic excitation, which reflects in their ultrafast sub-cycle dynamics under laser excitation. Moreover, due to its intrinsic in-plane anisotropy, harmonic yield with laser polarization along the armchair (AC) direction is found to be higher than that of the zigzag (ZZ) direction for all the strain cases. Nearly, an order of magnitude enhancement of harmonic intensity is achieved for -10% strain along AC direction. The current study expands the research possibilities of phosphorene into a previously unexplored domain, indicating its potential for future utilization in extreme-ultraviolet and attosecond nanophotonics, and also for efficient table-top HHG sources.</description>

      <title>Imaging a Chain of Rydberg Superatoms Enabled by F\"{o}rster-Resonance-Enhanced Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate single-shot and \textit{in situ} absorption imaging of individual Rydberg superatoms. This level of resolution is achieved using an electromagnetically induced transparency scheme involving a Rydberg energy level that is highly sensitive to the presence of Rydberg superatoms due to F\"{o}rster-resonance-enhanced dipole couplings. Spectroscopic measurements illustrate the existence of the F\"{o}rster resonance and underscore the state-selectivity of the technique. With an imaging exposure time as short as 3 $\mu$s, we successfully resolve linear chains of Rydberg superatoms excited in a one-dimensional configuration. The extracted second-order correlation shows strong anti-bunching due to excitation blockade, and a Fourier analysis reveals the long-range order in the chains of Rydberg superatoms. This imaging technique, with minimal destruction, will be of great interest for leveraging ensemble-encoded qubits in quantum computation and quantum simulation applications.</description>

      <title>Intra- and intercycle analysis of intraband high-order harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study intraband high-order harmonic generation arising from a band-gap material driven by a linearly polarized laser field. We factorize the intraband high-order harmonic-generation signal into intracycle and intercycle terms. The intracycle term uniquely determines the spectral characteristics whereas the intercycle term merely modulates the spectral features by imposing energy conservation in the long-pulse limit. Through analysis of the intracycle interference, the cutoff is identified, and the origin of the harmonic selection rules is revealed. Further, it is outlined how different components of the bandstructure contribute to different regions of the harmonic spectrum, giving rise to non-trivial intensity scaling of individual harmonics in the plateau region.</description>
