      <title>Towards Solving More Challenging IMO Problems via Decoupled Reasoning and Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) in formal languages is a foundational challenge for AI. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven remarkable progress, a significant gap remains between their powerful informal reasoning capabilities and their weak formal proving performance. Recent studies show that the informal accuracy exceeds 80% while formal success remains below 8% on benchmarks like PutnamBench. We argue this gap persists because current state-of-the-art provers, by tightly coupling reasoning and proving, are trained with paradigms that inadvertently punish deep reasoning in favor of shallow, tactic-based strategies. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose a novel framework that decouples high-level reasoning from low-level proof generation. Our approach utilizes two distinct, specialized models: a powerful, general-purpose Reasoner to generate diverse, strategic subgoal lemmas, and an efficient Prover to rigorously verify them. This modular design liberates the model's full reasoning potential and bypasses the pitfalls of end-to-end training. We evaluate our method on a challenging set of post-2000 IMO problems, a problem set on which no prior open-source prover has reported success. Our decoupled framework successfully solves 5 of these problems, demonstrating a significant step towards automated reasoning on exceptionally difficult mathematical challenges. To foster future research, we release our full dataset of generated and verified lemmas for a wide range of IMO problems, available at https://tencent-imo.github.io/ .</description>

      <title>Proof-Theoretic Functional Completeness for the Connexive Logic C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the functional completeness for the connectives of the non-trivial negation inconsistent logic C by using a well-established method implementing purely proof-theoretic notions only. Firstly, given that C contains a strong negation, expressing a notion of direct refutation, the proof needs to be applied in a bilateralist way in that not only higher-order rule schemata for proofs but also for refutations need to be considered. Secondly, given that C is a connexive logic we need to take a connexive understanding of inference as a basis, leading to a different conception of (higher-order) refutation than is usually employed.</description>

      <title>Forex Trading Robot Using Fuzzy Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a fuzzy system for conducting short-term transactions in the forex market. The system is designed to enhance common strategies in the forex market using fuzzy logic, thereby improving the accuracy of transactions. Traditionally, technical strategies based on oscillator indicators have relied on predefined ranges for indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Commodity Channel Indicator (CCI), and Stochastic to determine entry points for trades. However, the use of these classic indicators has yielded suboptimal results due to the changing nature of the market over time. In our proposed approach, instead of employing classical indicators, we introduce a fuzzy Mamdani system for each indicator. The results obtained from these systems are then combined through voting to design a trading robot. Our findings demonstrate a considerable increase in the profitability factor compared to three other methods. Additionally, net profit, gross profit, and maximum capital reduction are calculated and compared across all approaches.</description>

      <title>Base-extension Semantics for Intuitionistic Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proof theory and semantics of intuitionistic modal logics have been studied by Simpson in terms of Prawitz-style labelled natural deduction systems and Kripke models. An alternative to model-theoretic semantics is provided by proof-theoretic semantics, which is a logical realization of inferentialism, in which the meaning of constructs is understood through their use. The key idea in proof-theoretic semantics is that of a base of atomic rules, all of which refer only to propositional atoms and involve no logical connectives. A specific form of proof-theoretic semantics, known as base-extension semantics (B-eS), is concerned with the validity of formulae and provides a direct counterpart to Kripke models that is grounded in the provability of atomic formulae in a base. We establish, systematically, B-eS for Simpson's intuitionistic modal logics and, also systematically, obtain soundness and completeness theorems with respect to Simpson's natural deduction systems.</description>

      <title>Verifying Graph Algorithms in Separation Logic: A Case for an Algebraic Approach (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying graph algorithms has long been considered challenging in separation logic, mainly due to structural sharing between graph subcomponents. We show that these challenges can be effectively addressed by representing graphs as a partial commutative monoid (PCM), and by leveraging structure-preserving functions (PCM morphisms), including higher-order combinators.
  PCM morphisms are important because they generalize separation logic's principle of local reasoning. While traditional framing isolates relevant portions of the heap only at the top level of a specification, morphisms enable contextual localization: they distribute over monoid operations to isolate relevant subgraphs, even when nested deeply within a specification.
  We demonstrate the morphisms' effectiveness with novel and concise verifications of two canonical graph benchmarks: the Schorr-Waite graph marking algorithm and the union-find data structure.</description>

      <title>SMT and Functional Equation Solving over the Reals: Challenges from the IMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use SMT technology to address a class of problems involving uninterpreted functions and nonlinear real arithmetic. In particular, we focus on problems commonly found in mathematical competitions, such as the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), where the task is to determine all solutions to constraints on an uninterpreted function. Although these problems require only high-school-level mathematics, state-of-the-art SMT solvers often struggle with them. We propose several techniques to improve SMT performance in this setting.</description>

      <title>Modeling (Deontic) Modal Operators With the s(CASP) Goal-directed Predicate Answer Set Programming System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of implementing deontic modal logic. We show how (deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation (negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming (ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being elegantly resolved.</description>
