      <title>Scanned SQUID Microscope with High-speed Electrical Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a scanned superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope operating in a cryogen-free cryostat, with the capability of up to forty RF connections with 20 GHz bandwidth to a device under test. The system utilizes planar gradiometric DC SQUIDs, which are fully shielded except for a pair of pickup coils with radii as small as 250 nm and have on chip field coils allowing for susceptometry. The system noise is 1.3 $\mu\Phi_{0}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at the base temperature of 3.3 K. The sample temperature is variable and both magnetometry and susceptibility measurements are simultaneously possible with the sample temperature above 40 K. Through the use of a cryogenic chip socket and silicon interposer round trip RF losses to a sample are approximately 15 dB at 20 GHz. A combination of both active and passive magnetic shielding result in a residual magnetic field less than 100 nT at the sample location.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Methods for Computing Supercurrents in Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in Josephson junctions (JJs) has increased rapidly in recent years not only because of their use in qubits and other quantum devices but also due to the unique physics supported by the JJs. The advent of various novel quantum materials for both the barrier region and the superconducting leads has led to the possibility of adding new functionalities to the JJs. Thus, there is a growing need for accurate modeling of the JJs and related systems to enable their predictive control and atomistic level understanding. This review presents an in-depth discussion of a Green's function-based formalism for computing supercurrents in JJs. The formulation is tailored for large-scale atomistic simulations and encompasses both dc and ac supercurrents. We hope that this review will provide a timely and comprehensive reference for researchers as well as beginning practitioners interested in Green's-function-based methods to model supercurrents in JJs.</description>

      <title>Examining density wave correlations in high pressure $\rm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ through variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, a nickelate compound with a reported superconducting transition temperature of $\rm 80~K$, has attracted significant attention in recent years.Density-wave phenomena arising from strong electron correlations are widely regarded as key to unraveling the superconductivity mechanism, but the ordering and stability of these density waves remain a subject of contention in existing theoretical studies. In this work, we employ the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method to thoroughly examine the nature of density waves as functions of Coulomb repulsion and exchange interactions in bilayer two-orbital model proposed for the high pressure phase of $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$. We analyse the spin and charge correlation functions in a wide range of parameter space, and delineate a schematic phase diagram that separates different density-wave ground states. Our results provide useful insights into the understanding of electron correlations in $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, and highlight the potential of VMC to elucidate its superconducting mechanism.</description>

      <title>An $ab\;initio$ answer to long-debated questions about superconducting Nb$_3$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07307v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fully $ab\;initio$ microscopic description of cubic and tetragonal Nb$_3$Sn. We compute the anharmonic free energy surface, phonon spectra, and solve the full-bandwidth anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap of the two phases. Our results show that anharmonic effects are crucial to stabilize both the cubic and tetragonal structures, yielding phonon spectra in excellent agreement with neutron scattering data. We find that the martensitic transition is weakly first-order and that the superconducting gap is strongly anisotropic yet fully-open, with contributions from both longitudinal and transverse Nb $d$-orbitals, revealing an unexpected three-dimensional pairing mechanism. We also find that the experimentally observed reduction of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ across the transition is explained by a combination of overall weaker electron-phonon coupling and a redistribution of Fermi velocities, which shifts parts of the Fermi surface to longer coherence lengths and limits $H_{c2}$. Based on these insights, we propose that Sn-site doping could enhance transverse-state coupling and gap isotropy, potentially improving both $T_c$ and $H_{c2}$, while Nb-site doping reinforce $H_{c2}$ at the cost of lowering $T_c$.</description>

      <title>High-temperature growth of ultra thin NbTiN films on lithium niobate for integrated single photon detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) is an emerging photonic platform with high potential for scalable quantum information processing due to its strong second-order nonlinearity. However, little progress has been made in developing on-chip single-photon detectors on LNOI. Niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN) superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a promising candidate for this application. In this work, we use DC reactive magnetron sputtering to grow high-quality NbTiN thin films using an ultra-high vacuum deposition system with a base pressure lower than $2\times 10^{-10}$ mbar. Enabled by the low concentration of background impurities in this system, we investigate the impact of substrate temperature during NbTiN growth. We achieve four nm thick superconducting films with a critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of 12.3 K grown at a substrate temperature of 825 K. We find that the NbTiN films grow in the (111) orientation and evolve from a porous pillar structure when grown at low temperatures to densely packed fibrous grains at higher temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the increased substrate temperature reduces the oxygen concentration in our films and improves the overall stoichiometry. In addition, we integrate these films with the LNOI platform and investigate the obtained interface quality. Lastly, we fabricate SNSPDs from the NbTiN film on LNOI and characterize the detector performance.</description>

      <title>Performance enhancement in Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers by tailoring the relative distance between junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers with heterogeneously spaced junctions are theoretically investigated. We consider unit cells with three junctions and characterize their interaction by spatially displaced fields defined by node fluxes. To solve this problem we define the system action and apply the variational principle to obtain the static action, which determines the equations of motion. This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be increased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same unit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an optimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth, while equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance. Even though this method does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at different pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve gains above 20 dB. We show that this method can be combined with resonant-phase matching and predicts an ideal gain above 29 dB on a 4 GHz bandwidth with 1998 junctions. Despite possible challenges fabricating devices at the optimal sub-unit-cell size with current technologies, substantial gain increase can still be achieved at sub-optimal sizes.</description>

      <title>Electronic modes induced by spin and charge perturbations in Mott and Kondo insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic band structures usually remain unaffected by doping via a chemical-potential shift or by increasing the temperature in conventional band insulators. In contrast, it has been shown that those of Mott and Kondo insulators can change by doping or by increasing the temperature: electronic modes are induced within the band gap, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. Here, by generalizing the underlying mechanism of the remarkable strong-correlation effects, this study shows that various spin and charge perturbations, including magnetization of spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators, can induce electronic modes. The emergent modes can change the band structure, provided that a macroscopic number of spins or charges are excited by the perturbations at a moment. The origins and dispersion relations of the emergent modes are elucidated by investigating the selection rules and using the Bethe ansatz and effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping. The theoretical results are validated by numerical calculations for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models, periodic Anderson models, Kondo lattice models, and ladder and bilayer Hubbard models. This study significantly advances the fundamental understanding of the changes in the band structure driven by spin and charge perturbations and paves the way for band-structure engineering in strong-correlation electronics, utilizing the unconventional characteristics of strongly correlated insulators.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in tantalum superconducting circuits on silicon for scalable quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance and scalability of superconducting quantum circuits are fundamentally constrained by non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which induce microwave losses that limit resonator quality factors and qubit coherence times. Understanding and mitigating these excitations is therefore central to advancing scalable quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate on-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in high-Q {\alpha}-tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon, operated in the single-photon regime. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal persistent non-equilibrium quasiparticles at millikelvin temperatures, producing a measurable suppression of the internal quality factor (Qi) relative to theoretical expectations. By benchmarking across materials, we find that the quasiparticle density in {\alpha}-Ta is approximately one-third that of NbN at equivalent normalised temperatures (T/Tc), directly correlating with reduced microwave loss. Our methodology establishes a scalable platform for probing quasiparticle dynamics and points towards new routes for engineering superconducting circuits with improved coherence, with impact on qubit readout resonators, kinetic-inductance detectors, and emerging quantum processors and sensors.</description>

      <title>Full-scale Microwave SQUID Multiplexer Readout System for Magnetic Microcalorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of large cryogenic detector arrays, comprising hundreds to thousands of individual detectors, is highly beneficial for various cutting-edge applications, requiring large statistics, angular resolution or imaging capabilities. The readout of such arrays, however, presents a major challenge in terms of system complexity, parasitic heat load, and cost, which can be overcome only through multiplexing. Among the various multiplexing approaches, microwave SQUID multiplexing currently represents the state of the art, in particular for magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) readout. In this work, we demonstrate the successful operation of the latest generation of our microwave SQUID multiplexer-based readout system, based on a SQUID multiplexer tailored for MMC readout and a custom full-scale software-defined radio (SDR) electronics, capable of handling up to 400 channels. The system operates reliably across the entire 4-8 GHz frequency band and achieves sufficiently low flux noise levels in flux-ramp-demodulated readout. Our results confirm that our system is fully functional and provides a scalable path towards future large-scale, high-resolution MMC experiments.</description>

      <title>Cavity-induced Eliashberg effect: superconductivity vs charge density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that non-equilibrium effects can play a key role in cavity-based control of material phases, notably in systems with charge-density-wave order. Motivated by this, we extend the theory of the Eliashberg effect, originally developed for superconducting phases, to charge-density-wave phases. Starting from a minimal electronic model where superconductivity and charge-density-wave order are equivalent at equilibrium, we introduce coupling to cavity photons, which are in turn coupled to an environment at a temperature different from the one of the electronic environment. This drives the system into a non-thermal steady state, which breaks the equivalence between superconductivity and charge-density-wave order. In the superconducting case, we recover the known behavior: a shift from continuous to discontinuous phase transitions with bistability. In contrast, the charge-density-wave case displays richer behavior: tuning the cavity frequency induces both continuous and discontinuous transitions, two distinct ordered phases, and a bistable regime ending at a critical point. These findings demonstrate that the scope of cavity-based non-thermal control of quantum materials is broader than at thermal equilibrium, and strongly depends on the targeted phases.</description>

      <title>UTe$_2$: a narrow band superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</description>

      <title>Linking thermodynamic correlation signatures and superconductivity in twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted graphene multilayers exhibit strong electronic correlations, which manifest in a range of experimental signatures. Yet how these signatures relate to each other and the microscopic ground states-and how twist angle and band structure reshape them-remains poorly understood. Here we study this interplay by correlating local thermodynamic and transport measurements in a twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) sample with unequal angles and flat electronic bands. We use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the impact of electron-electron interactions in a region of the sample where the local twist angle evolves smoothly. We observe gapped correlated insulators and a sawtooth in electronic compressibility, both exhibiting pronounced electron-hole (e-h) asymmetry with distinct magic angles for conduction and valence bands. Subsequent transport measurements in the same region reveal robust superconductivity with a similar e-h asymmetry. Our measurements indicate that superconductivity is not directly tied to the correlated insulators. Instead, its critical temperature correlates closely with the strength of the sawtooth in compressibility, suggesting a common origin or link between the two. By combining a local probe with transport measurements, we uncover connections between superconductivity and thermodynamic correlation signatures that are not apparent from either technique in isolation, highlighting the power of our dual approach and establishing their dependence on interlayer twist angles in TTG.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript we analytically solve the linearised Usadel equation and the self-consistency equation, defining the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition of a superconducting film under the proximity effect in the dirty limit. This is a system of coupled differential and integral equations for the anomalous Green function and the order parameter of the superconductor. The proximity effect defines the boundary conditions. The formal solution of the system is found for the general case of the linearized boundary conditions defined by the proximity effect, reducing the set of equations to an eigenvalue problem. The latter defines the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition and the spatial distributions of the anomalous Green function and the superconducting order parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. As it becomes cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, triggering a superfluid transition. Previous studies on neutron superfluidity focused on finite-temperature transitions, with little attention paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of neutron star density $\rho$. The density serves as a nonthermal parameter for a superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, gapless neutrons are strongly coupled to the quantum critical fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling using both perturbation theory and renormalization group methods and find that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the neutron specific heat $c_{\mathrm{n}}\propto T$ and also dramatically alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire lifetime of a neutron star. At low temperatures, these phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior but occupy different layers. We incorporate superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and show that it substantially prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a number of neutron stars. Our results indicate an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>
