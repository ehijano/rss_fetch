      <title>Expansions and restrictions of structures and theories, their hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study some general principles and hierarchical properties of expansions and restrictions of structures and their theories The general approach is applied to describe these properties for classes of $\omega$-categorical theories and structures, Ehrenfeucht theories and their models, strongly minimal, $\omega_1$-theories, and stable ones.</description>

      <title>A formalization of Borel determinacy in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalization of Borel determinacy in the Lean 4 theorem prover. The formalization includes a definition of Gale-Stewart games and a proof of Martin's theorem stating that Borel games are determined. The proof closely follows Martin's "A purely inductive proof of Borel determinacy".</description>

      <title>Hodge theory and o-minimality at CIRM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the relationship between o-minimality and the so called Zilber-Pink conjecture. Since the work of Pila and Zannier, algebraization theorems in o-minimal geometry had profound impacts in Diophantine geometry (most notably on the study of special points in abelian and Shimura varieties). We will first focus on functional transcendence, discussing various recent and spectacular Ax-Schanuel theorems, and the related geometric part of Zilber-Pink. Armed with these tools, we will study the distribution of the Hodge locus of an arbitrary variation of Hodge structures (the typical/atypical dichotomy) and present some recent applications. We will conclude by describing the algebraicity and quasiprojectivity of images of period maps.</description>

      <title>Ivanova contact join-semilattices are not finitely axiomatizable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the class of Contact join-semilattices, as introduced by T. Ivanova, is not finitely axiomatizable. On the other hand, a simple finite axiomatization exists for the class of those join semilattices with a weak contact relation which can be embedded into the reduct of a Boolean algebra (equivalently, a distributive lattice) with a weak contact relation.</description>

      <title>Witnessed Symmetric Choice and Interpretations in Fixed-Point Logic with Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the core of the quest for a logic for PTime is a mismatch between algorithms making arbitrary choices and isomorphism-invariant logics. One approach to overcome this problem is witnessed symmetric choice. It allows for choices from definable orbits which are certified by definable witnessing automorphisms.
  We consider the extension of fixed-point logic with counting (IFPC) with witnessed symmetric choice (IFPC+WSC) and a further extension with an interpretation operator (IFPC+WSC+I). The latter operator evaluates a subformula in the structure defined by an interpretation. This structure possibly has other automorphisms exploitable by the WSC-operator. For similar extensions of pure fixed-point logic (IFP) it is known that IFP+WSCI simulates counting which IFP+WSC fails to do. For IFPC+WSC it is unknown whether the interpretation operator increases expressiveness and thus allows studying the relation between WSC and interpretations beyond counting.
  We separate IFPC+WSC from IFPC+WSCI by showing that IFPC+WSC is not closed under FO-interpretations. By the same argument, we answer an open question of Dawar and Richerby regarding non-witnessed symmetric choice in IFP. Additionally, we prove that nesting WSC-operators increases the expressiveness using the so-called CFI graphs. We show that if IFPC+WSC+I canonizes a particular class of base graphs, then it also canonizes the corresponding CFI graphs. This differs from various other logics, where CFI graphs provide difficult instances.</description>

      <title>Very basic set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13473v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ernst Zermelo's axiomatization of set theory (1908) did not exclude `a set that is a member of itself'. We call a set that is a member of itself `an individual'. In this article we prove the elimination of Russell's paradox is equivalent to "For every set S, an individual is a member of S or a set (but not an individual) is not a member of S". This shows there is place is set theory for individuals. And we show the set theory with individuals has its philosophical foundation in Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.</description>
