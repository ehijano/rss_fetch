      <title>Spin and Density Modes in a Binary Fluid of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the experimental observation of spin and density modes in a binary mixture of superfluids of light. A miscible Bose-Bose mixture with repulsive interactions is obtained by propagating, in the paraxial limit, the two circular polarization components of a laser through a non-linear hot atomic vapor. Controlling the intensity and phase for both polarizations allows us to selectively excite the fundamental modes of the mixture. Using a Bragg-like spectroscopy technique, we measure the dispersion relation and identify two distinct branches with different speeds of sound corresponding to the spin and density modes. At large photon density, we observe a crossing of these branches, which is due to an effective photon-photon interaction beyond the two-body regime and related to the saturation of the medium nonlinearity. This novel degree of freedom allows for precise control over the ratio of spin and density sound velocities and provide new insights into the control of binary mixtures collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of Tan's contact in a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tan contact has emerged as a pivotal quantity in characterizing many-body quantum systems, bridging microscopic short-range correlations to thermodynamic behavior. It is defined as the weight of universal $1/k^4$ fall off in momentum distribution tails, which can be measured directly in ultracold gases. So far, however, its direct measurement has been hindered in Bose gases due to interactions strongly affecting the expansion dynamics. Here, we present the first direct measurement of the Tan contact in a strongly-correlated Lieb-Liniger gas. Leveraging the one-dimensional geometry of our system, we implement a two-stage expansion scheme, yielding interaction-immune time-of-flight imaging. Our results show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions from quantum Monte Carlo calculations, which also provides independent thermometry of the experiment. By varying atom number, temperature, and interaction strength, we obtain results consistent with the universal scaling law predicted for the trapped Lieb-Liniger model. Our work paves the way for further characterization of the Lieb-Liniger gas across broad interaction regimes and holds promise for extension to other correlated quantum gases in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>From spontaneous to explicit symmetry breaking in a finite-sized system: Bosonic bound states of an impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a single attractive impurity in an ultracold repulsive bosonic system can drive a transition from a homogeneous to a localized state, as we here show for a one-dimensional ring system. In the few-body limit the localization of the bosons around the impurity, as seen in the pair correlations, is accompanied by low-lying modes that resemble finite-size precursors of Higgs-Anderson and Nambu-Goldstone-like modes. Tuning the impurity-boson mass ratio allows for the exploration of the transition from a spontaneous to an explicit breaking of the continuous rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We compare the minimum of the Higgs-Anderson-like mode as a marker of the onset of localization in the few-body limit to mean-field predictions of binding. We find improved agreement between the few-body exact diagonalization results and mean-field predictions of binding with increasing boson-boson repulsion.</description>

      <title>Realization of strongly-interacting Meissner phases in large bosonic flux ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can realize novel phases of matter that are not present in time-independent Hamiltonians. One important application is the engineering of synthetic gauge fields, which opens the realm of topological many-body physics to neutral atom quantum simulators. In this work, we leverage a neutral atom quantum simulator to experimentally realize the strongly-interacting Mott-Meissner phase in large-scale, bosonic flux ladders with 48 sites at half filling. By combining quantum gas microscopy with local basis rotations, we reveal the emerging equilibrium particle currents with local resolution across large systems. We find chiral currents exhibiting a characteristic interaction scaling, providing direct experimental evidence of the interacting Mott-Meissner phase. Moreover, we benchmark density correlations with numerical simulations and find that the effective temperature of the system is on the order of the tunnel coupling. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling periodically driven quantum systems to large, strongly correlated phases, paving the way for exploring topological quantum matter with single-atom resolution and control.</description>

      <title>Echoes and defects in the Calogero model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in 1D displaying $SO(2,1)$ hidden symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally-relevant drive protocols spanning both quasi-static and non-adiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground state echo amplitude and closely related ground state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.</description>

      <title>Dephasing induced long-ranged entangled pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a dephasing mechanism for generating symmetrically located long-range entangled pairs in a lattice. We consider a one-dimensional fermionic lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping subjected to a local dephasing at the central site. The dephasing-induced dynamics is strongly relaxing under strong symmetries and give rise to unique steady states in different symmetry sectors. Through explicit analytical calculations, we identify the symmetry sectors that support these strongly correlated robust pairs over arbitrarily long distances and provide analytical expressions of the steady-state correlation matrices. This experimentally relevant work promises applications in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exact Valence-Bond Solid Scars in the Square-Lattice Heisenberg Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the spin-s square-lattice Heisenberg model has exact many-body scars. These scars are simple valence-bond solids with exactly zero energy, and they exist in even-by-even systems and ladders of width 2. Ladders have additional scars corresponding to injecting one or two magnons on top of a parent valence-bond solid scar. These scars have a remarkably simple physical origin based only the angular momentum algebra and cancellations from spin-antialignment within a valence bond. Our comprehensive exact diagonalization calculations suggest that our valence-bond solids exhaust all exact eigenstates in the Heisenberg model except for few-magnon states near the top of the spectrum. Our scars are interesting because they are not part of a tower, have area-law entanglement, break translation symmetry, and exist for Heisenberg models of all spin.</description>

      <title>Driven-Dissipative Dynamics of Ultracold Atoms Trapped in an Array of Harmonic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a gas of ultracold atoms that are trapped in an array of harmonic potentials and that interacts with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that acts as a reservoir of Bogoliubov excitations. The ground and excited energy levels of these trapped ultracold atoms are coupled to each other via detuned Raman lasers with corresponding Rabi frequencies. Once excited via the Raman lasers, these trapped ultracold atoms then return to their ground energy levels, but not necessarily to their original trap locations, by emitting Bogoliubov excitations into the BEC. This combination of driving via Raman lasers to excited energy levels and dissipation via interaction with the BEC resulting in emission of Bogoliubov excitations into it will result in the trapped ultracold atoms approaching a steady state, whereby the expectation value of the number of trapped ultracold atoms in each harmonic trap of the array will attain a constant value over time. One can then use this system to prepare states that require a definite number of atoms in a particular energy level, such as BECs and atom lasers used for atom interferometry and for tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Excitations of a two-dimensional supersolid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the excitations of the two-dimensional supersolid state of a Bose-Einstein condensate with either dipole-dipole interactions or soft-core interactions. This supersolid state has three gapless excitation branches arising from the spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Two of these branches are related to longitudinal sound waves, similar to those in one-dimensional supersolids. The third branch is a transverse wave arising from the non-zero shear modulus of the two-dimensional crystal. We present the results of numerical calculations for the excitations and dynamic structure factor characterising the density fluctuations, and study their behavior across the discontinuous superfluid to supersolid transition. We show that the speeds of sound are described by a hydrodynamic theory that incorporates generalized elastic parameters, including the shear modulus. Furthermore, we establish that dipolar and soft-core supersolids manifest distinct characteristics, falling into the bulk incompressible and rigid lattice limits, respectively.</description>

      <title>Universal description of massive point vortices and verification methods of vortex inertia in superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex mass, which is the inertia of a quantum vortex, has never been observed in superfluids and is a long-standing problem in low temperature physics. The impact of the mass is considered negligible in typical experiments with superfluid $^4$He. Recent developments of experimental techniques for manipulating quantum vortices in superfluid atomic gases have enabled us to test this problem more accurately. By introducing the vortex mass time and length as universal scales to many-body problems of massive quantum vortices, the theoretical description is formulated in the simplest manner and is universally applicable to different quantum fluids, including fermionic and multicomponent superfluids. There are two branches, the cyclotron and massless branches, for the circular motion of a pair of like-sign vortices. Finding a stable cyclotron branch for the motion of vortices is a clear evidence of vortex mass and superfluid $^3$He-B is the specific example of a system where this phenomena could be observed. The impact of the mass on the massless branch is small but can be enhanced by taking the difference in the two-body dynamics of point vortices with different initial conditions. Our results imply that the vortex mass is a direct cause of the splitting instability of a doubly quantized vortex at absolute zero and that the vortex mass length characterizes the final state after the instability. It is also demonstrated that a pair of massive vortices with opposite circulations has a critical distance characterized by the vortex mass length, below which they are spontaneously annihilated without thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom, which play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we propose an orbital optical Raman lattice to study exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which features a global topological chiral orbital current, and the two-dimensional spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns. The former has topological Bogoliubov excitations characterized by a uniform Chern number, while the spin-orbital supersolid phase hosts topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers which respectively protect the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our findings may inspire a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and shall also advance the experimental progress of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum impurities in finite-temperature Bose gases: Detecting vortex proliferation across the BKT and BEC transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting vortices in neutral superfluids represents an outstanding experimental challenge. Using stochastic classical-field methods, we theoretically show that a quantum impurity repulsively coupled to a weakly-interacting Bose gas at finite temperature carries direct spectroscopic signatures of vortex proliferation. In two dimensions, we find that a low-energy (attractive) branch in the excitation spectrum becomes prominent when the temperature is tuned across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. We explain this red-shifted resonance as originating from the binding of the impurity to vortices, where the bosons density (and hence, the repulsive Hartree energy) is reduced. This mechanism could be exploited to spectroscopically estimate the BKT transition in excitonic insulators. In contrast, in three dimensions, the impurity spectra reflect the presence of vortex rings well below the condensation temperature, and herald the presence of a thermal gas above the Bose-Einstein condensation transition. Importantly, we expect our results to have impact on the understanding of Bose-polaron formation at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Relativistic BEC extracted from a complex FRG flow equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation, we analyze the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the relativistic complex scalar theory. This framework leads to a complex flow equation of the effective potential, even with the well-known Litim regulator. In order to evaluate the condensate from such a complex effective potential, we impose a condition between chemical potential and mass, analogously to those in the free theory or the mean field theory. We elucidate that for the strongly (weakly) coupled theory, the phase diagrams computed from the FRG are more (less) deviated from that under the mean field approximation. This result implies that quantum fluctuations strongly affect the nonperturbative formation of the BEC.</description>
