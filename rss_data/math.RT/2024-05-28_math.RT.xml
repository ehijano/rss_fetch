      <title>Bounds for $\mathrm{SL}_2$-indecomposables in tensor powers of the natural representation in characteristic $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$, $G$ be the algebraic group $\mathrm{SL}_2$ over $K$, and $V$ be the natural representation of $G$. Let $b_k^{G,V}$ denote the number of $G$-indecomposable factors of $V^{\otimes k}$, counted with multiplicity, and let $\delta = \frac 32 - \frac{\log 3}{2\log 2}$. Then there exists a smooth multiplicatively periodic function $\omega(x)$ such that $b_{2k}^{G,V} = b_{2k+1}^{G,V}$ is asymptotic to $\omega(k) k^{-\delta}4^k$. We also prove a lower bound of the form $c_W k^{-\delta}(\dim W)^k$ for $b_k^{G,W} $ for any tilting representation $W$ of $G$.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantization and unitary highest weight Harish-Chandra supermodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric quantization transforms a symplectic manifold with Lie group action to a unitary representation. In this article, we extend geometric quantization to the super setting. We consider real forms of contragredient Lie supergroups with compact Cartan subgroups, and study their actions on some pseudo-K\"ahler supermanifolds. We construct their unitary representations in terms of sections of some line bundles. These unitary representations contain highest weight Harish-Chandra supermodules, whose occurrences depend on the image of the moment map. As a result, we construct a Gelfand model of highest weight Harish-Chandra supermodules. We also perform symplectic reduction, and show that quantization commutes with reduction.</description>

      <title>The stable category of monomorphisms between (Gorenstein) projective modules with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let (S; n) be a commutative noetherian local ring and let w in n be non-zero divisor. This paper is concerned with the two categories of monomorphisms between finitely generated (Gorenstein) projective S-modules, such that their cokernels are annihilated by w. It is shown that these categories, which will be denoted by Mon(w;P) and Mon(w; G), are both Frobenius categories with the same projective objects. It is also proved that the stable category Mon(w;P) is triangle equivalent to the category of D-branes of type B, DB(w), which has been introduced by Kontsevich and studied by Orlov. Moreover, it will be observed that the stable categories Mon(w;P) and Mon(w; G) are closely related to the singularity category of the factor ring R = S=(w). Precisely, there is a fully faithful triangle functor from the stable category Mon(w; G) to Dsg(R), which is dense if and only if R (and so S) are Gorenstein rings. Particularly, it is proved that the density of the restriction of this functor to Mon(w;P), guarantees the regularity of the ring S.</description>

      <title>On local character expansions for principal series representations of general linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain two explicit formulas for the full local character expansion of any irreducible representation of a p-adic general linear group in principal blocks. The first, generalizing previous work of the author on the Iwahori-spherical case, expresses the expansion in terms of dimensions of degenerate Whittaker models. The second gives a closed expression in terms of values of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of a suitable permutation group.</description>

      <title>Alcove walk models for parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections and branching to Levi subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article establishes alcove walk models for intersections of Schubert varieties and partially semi-infinite orbits in the affine Grassmannian of a split reductive group (we call such intersections parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections). More precisely, we describe explicit cellular pavings of these intersections, indexed by certain positively-folded alcove walks. We prove a parametrization of the irreducible components of maximal possible dimension, in terms of alcove walks of maximal possible dimension. We then deduce a new combinatorial description of branching to Levi subgroups of irreducible highest weight representations, and in particular we give a new algorithm for computing the characters of such representations.</description>

      <title>Galois descent of splendid Rickard equivalences for blocks of $p$-nilpotent groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We strengthen the results of Boltje and Yilmaz regarding the Galois descent of equivalences of blocks of $p$-nilpotent groups and a result of Kessar and Linckelmann regarding Galois descent of splendid Rickard equivalences for blocks with compatible Galois stabilizers. A more general descent criteria for chain complexes is proven along the way, which requires the adaptation of a theorem of Reiner for chain complexes. This verifies Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for blocks of $p$-nilpotent groups with abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss some categorical aspects of the objects that appear in the construction of the Monster and other sporadic simple groups. We define the basic representation of the categorical torus $\mathcal T$ classified by an even symmetric bilinear form $I$ and of the semi-direct product of $\mathcal T$ with its canonical involution. We compute the centraliser of the basic representation of $\mathcal T\rtimes\{\pm1\}$ and find it to be a categorical extension of the extraspecial $2$-group with commutator $I\mod 2$. We study the inertia groupoid of a categorical torus and find that it is given by the torsor of the topological Looijenga line bundle, so that $2$-class functions on $\mathcal T$ are canonically theta-functions. We discuss how discontinuity of the categorical character in our formalism means that the character of the basic representation fails to be a categorical class function. We compute the automorphisms of $\mathcal T$ and of $\mathcal T\rtimes\{\pm1\}$ and relate these to the Conway groups.</description>

      <title>Module-theoretic approach to dualizable Grothendieck categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every dualizable Grothendieck category whose dual is again a Grothendieck category satisfies Grothendieck's conditions Ab6 and Ab4*, by taking a module-theoretic approach based on the Gabriel-Popescu embedding. Combining this with a result by Stefanich, we conclude that the class of dualizable linear cocomplete categories is precisely the class of linear Grothendieck category satisfying Ab6 and Ab4*. This provides a complete answer to a modified conjecture on the dualizability, originally posed by Brandenburg, Chirvasitu, and Johnson-Freyd.</description>

Abstract: Roger Carter (1934--2022) was a very well known mathematician working in algebra, representation theory and Lie theory. He spent most of his mathematical career in Warwick. Roger was a great communicator of mathematics: the clarity, precision and enthusiasm of his lectures delivered in his beautiful handwriting were hallmark features recalled by numerous students and colleagues. His books have been described as marvelous pieces of scholarship and service to the general mathematical community. We both met Roger early in our careers, and were encouraged and influenced by him~ -- ~and his lovely sense of humour. This text is our tribute, both to his mathematical achievements, and to his kindness and generosity towards his students, his colleagues, his collaborators, and his family.</description>

      <title>Knot theory and cluster algebras II: The knot cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To every knot (or link) diagram K, we associate a cluster algebra A that contains a cluster x with the property that every cluster variable in x specializes to the Alexander polynomial of K. We call x the knot cluster of A. Furthermore, there exists a cluster automorphism of A of order two that maps the initial cluster to the cluster x.
  We realize this connection between knot theory and cluster algebras in two ways. In our previous work, we constructed indecomposable representations T(i) of the initial quiver Q of the cluster algebra A. Modulo the removal of 2-cycles, the quiver Q is the incidence quiver of the segments in K, and the representation T(i) of Q is built by taking successive boundaries of K cut open at the i-th segment. The relation to the Alexander polynomial stems from an isomorphism between the submodule lattice of T(i) and the lattice of Kauffman states of K relative to segment i.
  In the current article, we identify the knot cluster x in A via a sequence of mutations that we construct from a sequence of bigon reductions and generalized Reidemeister III moves on the diagram K. On the level of diagrams, this sequence first reduces K to the Hopf link, then reflects the Hopf link to its mirror image, and finally rebuilds (the mirror image of) K by reversing the reduction. We show that every diagram of a prime link admits such a sequence.
  We further prove that the cluster variables in x have the same F-polynomials as the representations T(i). This establishes the important fact that our representations T(i) do indeed correspond to cluster variables in A. But it even establishes the much stronger result that these cluster variables are all compatible, in the sense that they form a cluster.
  We also prove that the representations T(i) have the following symmetry property. For all vertices i,j of Q, the dimension of T(i) at j is equal to the dimension of T(j) at i.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ``change of weights'' maps between loci of the stack of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over the Robba ring with integral Hodge-Tate-Sen weights. We show that in the $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ case these maps can realize translations of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules geometrically. The motivation is to investigate translations of locally analytic representations under the categorical $p$-adic Langlands correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We characterize when a finite group G possesses a Sylow 3-subgroup P with abelianization of order 9 in terms of the number of height zero characters lying in the principal 3-block of G, settling a conjecture put forward by Navarro, Sambale, and Tiep in 2018. Along the way, we show that a recent result by Laradji on the number of character of height zero in a block that lie above a given character of some normal subgroup holds, without any hypothesis on the group for blocks of maximal defect.</description>

Abstract: We study the three-point $\mathfrak{sl_2}$-Gaudin model. In this case the compactification of the parameter space is $\overline{M_{0,4}(\mathbb{C})}$, which is the Riemann sphere. We analyze these sphere coverings by the joint spectrum of the Gaudin Hamiltonians treating them as algebraic curves. We write equations of these curves as determinants of tridiagonal matrices and observe that their branch points form remarkable patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cuspidal automorphic representations $\tau$ of $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ correspond to global long root $A$-parameters for $\mathsf{G}_2$. Using an exceptional theta lift between $\mathrm{PU}_3$ and $\mathsf{G}_2$, we construct the associated global $A$-packet and prove the Arthur multiplicity formula for these representations when $\tau$ is dihedral and satisfies some technical hypotheses. We also prove that this subspace of the discrete automorphic spectrum forms a full near equivalence class. Our construction yields new examples of quaternionic modular forms on $\mathsf{G}_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Hazeltine-Liu, and independently Haan-Kim-Kwon, proved a local converse theorem for $\mathrm{SO}_{2n}(F)$ over a $p$-adic field $F$, which says that, up to an outer automorphism of $\mathrm{SO}_{2n}(F)$, an irreducible generic representation of $\mathrm{SO}_{2n}(F)$ is uniquely determined by its twisted gamma factors by generic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_k(F)$ for $k=1,\dots,n$. It is desirable to remove the ``up to an outer automorphism" part in the above theorem using more twisted gamma factors, but this seems a hard problem. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem for the group $\mathrm{SO}_4(F)$, namely, we show that a generic supercuspidal representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{SO}_4(F)$ is uniquely determined by its $\mathrm{GL}_1$, $\mathrm{GL}_2$ twisted local gamma factors and a twisted exterior square local gamma factor of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Endotrivial complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, $p$ a prime, and $k$ a field of characteristic $p$. We introduce the notion of an endotrivial chain complex of $p$-permutation $kG$-modules, which are the invertible objects in the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation $kG$-modules, and study the corresponding Picard group $\mathcal{E}_k(G)$ of endotrivial complexes. Such complexes are shown to induce splendid Rickard autoequivalences of $kG$. The elements of $\mathcal{E}_k(G)$ are determined uniquely by integral invariants arising from the Brauer construction and a degree one character $G \to k^\times$. Using ideas from Bouc's theory of biset functors, we provide a canonical decomposition of $\mathcal{E}_k(G)$, and as an application, give complete descriptions of $\mathcal{E}_k(G)$ for abelian groups and $p$-groups of normal $p$-rank 1. Taking Lefschetz invariants of endotrivial complexes induces a group homomorphism $\Lambda: \mathcal{E}_k(G) \to O(T(kG))$, where $O(T(kG))$ is the orthogonal unit group of the trivial source ring. Using recent results of Boltje and Carman, we give a Frobenius stability condition elements in the image of $\Lambda$ must satisfy.</description>

Abstract: For any integer $n\ge 0$ and any ring $R$, \ $(\mathcal {PGF}_n, \ \mathcal P_n^\perp \cap \mathcal {PGF}^{\perp})$ proves to be a complete hereditary cotorsion pair in $R$-Mod, where $\mathcal {PGF}$ is the class of PGF modules, introduced by J. \v{S}aroch and J. \v{S}\'{t}ov\'{i}\v{c}ek, and \ $\mathcal {PGF}_n$ is the class of $R$-modules of PGF dimension $\le n$. For any Artin algebra $R$, \ $(\mathcal {GP}_n, \ \mathcal P_n^\perp \cap \mathcal {GP}^{\perp})$ proves to be a complete and hereditary cotorsion pair in $R$-Mod, where $\mathcal {GP}_n$ is the class of modules of Gorenstein projective dimension $\le n$. These cotorsion pairs induce two chains of hereditary Hovey triples \ $(\mathcal {PGF}_n, \ \mathcal P_n^\perp, \ \mathcal {PGF}^{\perp})$ and \ $(\mathcal {GP}_n, \ \mathcal P_n^\perp, \ \mathcal {GP}^{\perp})$, and the corresponding homotopy categories in the same chain are the same. It is observed that some complete cotorsion pairs in $R$-Mod can induce complete cotorsion pairs in some special extension closed subcategories of $R$-Mod. Then corresponding results in exact categories $\mathcal {PGF}_n$, \ $\mathcal {GP}_n$, \ $\mathcal {GF}_n$, \ $\mathcal {PGF}^{&lt;\infty}$, \ $\mathcal {GP}^{&lt;\infty}$ and $\mathcal {GF}^{&lt;\infty}$, are also obtained. As a byproduct, $\mathcal{PGF} = \mathcal {GP}$ for a ring $R$ if and only if $\mathcal{PGF}^\perp\cap\mathcal{GP}_n=\mathcal P_n$ for some $n$.</description>

      <title>On a stability of higher level Coxeter unipotent representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a connected reductive group over $\mathcal{O}$, a complete discrete valuation ring with finite residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $R_{T_r,U_r}^{\theta}$ be a level $r$ Deligne--Lusztig representation of $\mathbb{G}(\mathcal{O})$. We show that, if $q$ is not small, the Coxeter unipotent $R_{T_r,U_r}^1$ degenerates to the $r=1$ case. For $\mathbb{G}=\mathrm{GL}_2$ (or $\mathrm{SL}_2$), as an application we give the dimensions and decompositions of all Coxeter $R_{T_r,U_r}^{\theta}$. For general $\mathbb{G}$ we state a conjectural sign formula for $R_{T_r,U_r}^{\theta}$.</description>

      <title>Realization of monoids with countable sum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every infinite cardinal number $\kappa$, $\kappa$-monoids and their realization have recently been introduced and studied by Nazemian and Smertnig. A $\kappa$-monoid $H$ has a realization to a ring $R$ if there exists an element $x \in H$ such that $H$ is $\aleph_1 ^{-}$-braided over $\text{add}(\aleph_0 x)$, and $\text{add}(\aleph_0 x)$, as $\aleph_0$-monoid, has a realization to $R$. Furthermore, $H$ has a realization to hereditary rings if there exists an element $x \in H$ such that $H$ is braided over $\text{add}(x)$. These prompt an investigation into when $\aleph_0$-monoids have realizations. In this paper, we discuss the realization of $\aleph_0$-monoids and provide a complete characterization for the realization of two-generated ones in hereditary Von Neumann regular rings.</description>

      <title>On finite generation in magnitude (co)homology, and its torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to apply the framework, which was developed by Sam and Snowden, to study structural properties of graph homologies, in the spirit of Ramos, Miyata and Proudfoot. Our main results concern the magnitude homology of graphs introduced by Hepworth and Willerton. More precisely, for graphs of bounded genus, we prove that magnitude cohomology, in each homological degree, has rank which grows at most polynomially in the number of vertices, and that its torsion is bounded. As a consequence, we obtain analogous results for path homology of (undirected) graphs. We complement the work with a proof that the category of planar graphs of bounded genus and marked edges, with contractions, is quasi-Gr\"obner.</description>

      <title>Strong duality Data of type $A$ and extended $T$-systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extended $T$-systems are a number of short exact sequences in the category of finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras of types $A_n^{(1)}$ and $B_n^{(1)}$, introduced by Mukhin and Young as a generalization of the $T$-systems. In this paper we establish the extended $T$-systems for more general modules, which are constructed from an arbitrary strong duality datum of type $A$. Our approach does not use the theory of $q$-characters, and so also provides a new proof to the original Mukhin-Young's extended $T$-systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Clifford invariants of ADE Coxeter elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in novel Clifford geometric invariants of linear transformations. This motivates the investigation of such invariants for a certain type of geometric transformation of interest in the context of root systems, reflection groups, Lie groups and Lie algebras: the Coxeter transformations. We perform exhaustive calculations of all Coxeter transformations for $A_8$, $D_8$ and $E_8$ for a choice of basis of simple roots and compute their invariants, using high-performance computing. This computational algebra paradigm generates a dataset that can then be mined using techniques from data science such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning. In this paper we focus on neural network classification and principal component analysis. Since the output -- the invariants -- is fully determined by the choice of simple roots and the permutation order of the corresponding reflections in the Coxeter element, we expect huge degeneracy in the mapping. This provides the perfect setup for machine learning, and indeed we see that the datasets can be machine learned to very high accuracy. This paper is a pump-priming study in experimental mathematics using Clifford algebras, showing that such Clifford algebraic datasets are amenable to machine learning, and shedding light on relationships between these novel and other well-known geometric invariants and also giving rise to analytic results.</description>

Abstract: We study admissible subcategories of the derived categories of smooth noncommutative curves as classified by Reiten-van den Bergh. We prove phantom subcategories do not exist in these derived categories and we obtain a complete classification of the admissible subcategories of the bounded derived category of representations of an acyclic quiver.</description>

      <title>A refined Weyl character formula for comodules on $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be any commutative unital ring and let $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$ be the general linear group scheme on $A$ of rank $2$. We study the representation theory of $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$ and the symmetric powers $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$, where $(V, \Delta)$ is the standard right comodule on $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. We prove a refined Weyl character formula for $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$. There is for any integer $d \geq 1$ a (canonical) refined weight space decomposition $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V) \cong \oplus_i \operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ where each direct summand $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ is a comodule on $N \subseteq \operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. Here $N$ is the schematic normalizer of the diagonal torus $T \subseteq \operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. We prove a character formula for the direct summands of $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$ for any integer $d \geq 1$. This refined Weyl character formula implies the classical Weyl character formula. As a Corollary we get a refined Weyl character formula for the pull back $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V \otimes K)$ as a comodule on $\operatorname{GL}(2,K)$ where $K$ is any field. We also calculate explicit examples involving the symmetric powers, symmetric tensors and their duals. The refined weight space decomposition exists in general for group schemes such as $\operatorname{GL}(n,A)$ and $\operatorname{SL}(n,A)$. The study may have applications to the study of groups $G$ such as $\operatorname{SL}(n,k)$ and $\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$ and quotients $G/H$ where $k$ is an arbitrary field (or a Dedekind domain) and $H \subseteq G$ is a closed subgroup. The refined weight space decomposition of $S_{\lambda}(V)$ has a relation with irreducible module over a field of positiv characteristic. In an example I prove it recovers the irreducible module $V(\lambda) \subsetneq S_{\lambda}(V)$.</description>
