      <title>Water-induced buoyancy controls transient water storage in the mantle transition zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinel phase (wadsleyite, ringwoodite) in the mantle transition zone (MTZ), can contain up to 1-2 weight percent of water. However, whether these water reservoirs in the MTZ are filled is debated. Here, we investigate water dynamics in the MTZ numerically by using a newly developed empirical model of deep hydrous mantle melting combined with 2D thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) upper mantle models. Numerical modeling results suggest that water-induced buoyancy triggers the development of hydrous solid-state mantle upwellings in the MTZ. On time scales of some tens of millions of years, they rise to and interact with the spinel-olivine phase transition. Depending on the water content and temperature of these thermal-chemical plumes, this crossing may trigger hydrous melting by water release from the wadsleyite upon its conversion to olivine. The melts are less dense than the solid matrix and continue rising upward in the form of either diapirs or porosity waives. Similar dehydration-induced melting process3 is also documented for the lower MTZ boundary, where hydrous downwellings (such as subducted slabs) generate buoyant melt diapirs rising through the MTZ. We therefore suggest that the MTZ operates as a transient water reservoir. Relatively small amounts of water (less than 0.1 weight percent, smaller than 0.2 ocean masses) and a geologically moderate duration (80-430 Myr) of the transient water storage should be characteristic for the MTZ, which may play a key role in stabilizing the surface ocean mass on Earth and Earth-like rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Ice-free geomorphometry of Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica: 3. Belgica and Yamato (Queen Fabiola) Mountains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geomorphometric modeling and mapping of ice-free Antarctic areas can be applied for obtaining new quantitative knowledge about the topography of these unique landscapes and for the further use of morphometric information in Antarctic research. Within the framework of a project of creating a physical geographical thematic scientific reference geomorphometric atlas of ice-free areas of Antarctica, we performed geomorphometric modeling and mapping of two, partly ice-free mountainous areas of the eastern Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica. These include the Belgica Mountains and Yamato (Queen Fabiola) Mountains. As input data, we used two fragments of the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA). For the two ice-free areas and adjacent glaciers, we derived models and maps of eleven, most scientifically important morphometric variables (i.e., slope, aspect, horizontal curvature, vertical curvature, minimal curvature, maximal curvature, catchment area, topographic wetness index, stream power index, total insolation, and wind exposition index). The obtained models and maps describe the ice-free topography of the Belgica Mountains and Yamato (Queen Fabiola) Mountains in a rigorous, quantitative, and reproducible manner. New morphometric data can be useful for further geological, geomorphological, glaciological, ecological, and hydrological studies of these areas.</description>

      <title>Groundwater feedbacks on ice sheets and subglacial hydrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of many of Antarctica's glaciers are modulated by a hydrological system at the base of the ice. Sedimentary basins beneath the ice bed contribute to the water budget in this hydrological system by discharging or taking up water. However, sedimentary basins are not included in most current models of ice dynamics, and little is known about their effect. In this paper we develop an idealised model of a glacier whose sliding is coupled to a subglacial hydrological system, which includes a sedimentary basin. We find that groundwater discharge (exfiltration) and recharge (infiltration) are controlled by the shape of the ice sheet and of the sedimentary basin, and that exfiltration promotes sliding whereas infiltration hinders it. Overall, the presence of a sedimentary basin leads to thicker and slower-flowing ice in the steady state. We also find that, when the ice sheet is undergoing retreating, groundwater exfiltration can lead to a positive feedback which accelerates this retreat. Our results shed light on the potential role and importance of Antarctic sedimentary basins, and how these might be incorporated into existing models of ice and subglacial hydrology.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics from geomagnetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz-symmetry violation may be described via the CPT-odd, dimension-3, Carroll-Field-Jackiw term, which couples the electromagnetic fields to a constant 4-vector $k_{\rm AF}$ selecting a preferred direction in spacetime. We solve the field equations using the Green's method for a static point-like magnetic dipole and find the $k_{\rm AF}$-dependent corrections to the standard dipolar magnetic field that strongly dominates the near-Earth magnetic field. Given the very good agreement between current models and ground- and satellite-based geomagnetic data, our strongest constraints on the components of $k_{\rm AF}$ in the Sun-centered frame read $|(k_{\rm AF})_Z| \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-25} \, {\rm GeV}$ for $|(k_{\rm AF})_X|, |(k_{\rm AF})_Y| \lesssim 10^{-24} \, {\rm GeV}$ at the two-sigma level. This represents an improvement of about four orders of magnitude over earlier bounds based on other geophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Seismic event classification with a lightweight Fourier Neural Operator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time monitoring of induced seismicity is critical to mitigate operational risks, relying on the rapid and accurate classification of triggered data from continuous data streams. Deep learning models are effective for this purpose but require substantial computational resources, making real-time processing difficult. To address this limitation, a lightweight model based on the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is proposed for the classification of microseismic events, leveraging its inherent resolution-invariance and computational efficiency for waveform processing. In the STanford EArthquake Dataset (STEAD), a global and large-scale database of seismic waveforms, the FNO-based model demonstrates high effectiveness for trigger classification, with an F1 score of 95% even in the scenario of data sparsity in training. The new FNO model greatly decreases the computer power needed relative to current deep learning models without sacrificing the classification success rate measured by the F1 score. A test on a real microseismic dataset shows a classification success rate with an F1 score of 98%, outperforming many traditional deep-learning techniques. The reduced computational cost makes the proposed FNO model well suited for deployment in resource-constrained, near-real-time seismic monitoring workflows, including traffic-light implementations. The source code for the proposed FNO classifier will be available at: https://github.com/ayratabd/FNOclass.</description>

      <title>Coherent Source Subsampling: A Data-Driven Strategy for Restoring Causal-Acausal Symmetry in Ambient Seismic Wavefield Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ambient noise tomography relies on the assumption that the seismic wavefield is equipartitioned. In practice, ambient noise sources are spatially and temporally heterogeneous, producing biased estimates of the Green's function between stations. We introduce a data-driven method, Coherent Source Subsampling (CSS), which selects and averages only cross-correlation time windows associated with excitation of sources in the stationary zone. By restricting the ensemble average to these windows, CSS mitigates the effects of nonuniform source distribution and restores causal-acausal symmetry in the retrieved interstation response. Applications to regional ambient-noise datasets show that CSS stabilizes surface-wave dispersion measurements even when source statistics violate the assumptions of standard seismic interferometry. For the central California dataset, CSS-derived group-velocity tomograms consistently image a high-velocity block between the Rinconada and San Andreas faults across multiple periods. In comparison, the full-ensemble (linear) average does not capture this block, which is well established. Our approach is particularly useful for short-duration passive surveys.</description>

      <title>FormationEval, an open multiple-choice benchmark for petroleum geoscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents FormationEval, an open multiple-choice question benchmark for evaluating language models on petroleum geoscience and subsurface disciplines. The dataset contains 505 questions across seven domains including petrophysics, petroleum geology and reservoir engineering, derived from three authoritative sources using a reasoning model with detailed instructions and a concept-based approach that avoids verbatim copying of copyrighted text. Each question includes source metadata to support traceability and audit. The evaluation covers 72 models from major providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta and open-weight alternatives. The top performers achieve over 97% accuracy, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview reaching 99.8%, while tier and domain gaps persist. Among open-weight models, GLM-4.7 leads at 98.6%, with several DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen and Mistral models also exceeding 93%. The performance gap between open-weight and closed models is narrower than expected, with several lower-cost open-weight models exceeding 90% accuracy. Petrophysics emerges as the most challenging domain across all models, while smaller models show wider performance variance. Residual length bias in the dataset (correct answers tend to be longer) is documented along with bias mitigation strategies applied during construction. The benchmark, evaluation code and results are publicly available.</description>
