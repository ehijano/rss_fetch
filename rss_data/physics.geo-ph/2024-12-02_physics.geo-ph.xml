      <title>Exploring the conditions conducive to convection within the Greenland Ice Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plumes within the Greenland Ice Sheet disrupt radiostratigraphy and complicate the use of isochrones in reconstructions of past ice dynamics. Here we use numerical modeling to test the hypothesis that convection is a viable mechanism for the formation of the large (\(&gt;\)1/3 ice thickness) englacial plumes observed in north Greenland. Greater horizontal shear and snow accumulation impede plume formation, while stable and softer ice encourages them. These results potentially explain the dearth of basal plumes in the younger and higher-accumulation southern ice sheet. Leveraging this mechanism to place bounds on ice rheology suggests that -- for north Greenland -- ice viscosity may be \(\sim\)9-15 times lower than commonly assumed. Softer-than-assumed ice there implies significantly reduced basal sliding compared to standard models. Implementing a softer basal ice rheology in numerical models may help reduce uncertainty in projections of future ice-sheet mass balance.</description>

      <title>Enhanced anomaly detection in well log data through the application of ensemble GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown significant success in modeling data distributions for image datasets, their application to structured or tabular data, such as well logs, remains relatively underexplored. This study extends the ensemble GANs (EGANs) framework to capture the distribution of well log data and detect anomalies that fall outside of these distributions. The proposed approach compares the performance of traditional methods, such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), with EGANs in detecting anomalies outside the expected data distributions. For the gamma ray (GR) dataset, EGANs achieved a precision of 0.62 and F1 score of 0.76, outperforming GMM's precision of 0.38 and F1 score of 0.54. Similarly, for travel time (DT), EGANs achieved a precision of 0.70 and F1 score of 0.79, surpassing GMM 0.56 and 0.71. In the neutron porosity (NPHI) dataset, EGANs recorded a precision of 0.53 and F1 score of 0.68, outshining GMM 0.47 and 0.61. For the bulk density (RHOB) dataset, EGANs achieved a precision of 0.52 and an F1 score of 0.67, slightly outperforming GMM, which yielded a precision of 0.50 and an F1 score of 0.65. This work's novelty lies in applying EGANs for well log data analysis, showcasing their ability to learn data patterns and identify anomalies that deviate from them. This approach offers more reliable anomaly detection compared to traditional methods like GMM. The findings highlight the potential of EGANs in enhancing anomaly detection for well log data, delivering significant implications for optimizing drilling strategies and reservoir management through more accurate, data-driven insights into subsurface characterization.</description>

      <title>HOPE: An Automatically Differentiable High-Order Non-Oscillatory Finite-Volume Shallow-Water Dynamic Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19185v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An automatically differentiable, high-order non-oscillatory finite volume shallow water dynamic core has been constructed on a cubed sphere grid. This dynamic core has four advantageous properties: high order accuracy, essential non-oscillation, mass conservation, and scalability. Besides, the code development is based on PyTorch, enabling the model to run seamlessly on both CPU and GPU, while naturally possessing the capability of automatic differentiation. We named the new dynamic core as High Order Prediction Environment (HOPE). The spatial reconstruction is based on the two-dimensional tensor product polynomial and the genuine two-dimensional Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme. A novel panel boundary approach ensures that the accuracy can reach arbitrary order. The algorithm has very high degree of compatibility with GPU architecture, allowing the computational overhead to be mitigated through the utilization of GPU. The LMARS (Low Mach number Approximate Riemann Solver) scheme is adopted as Riemann solvers to determine fluxes on the Gaussian points on edges. Flux across the interface between each cell edge is computed using linear Gaussian quadrature, and the tendency of prognostic values is obtained by summing all fluxes around the cell. This shallow water dynamic core demonstrates outstanding performance in ideal shallow water test cases. In the steady-state geostrophic flow, the 11th order scheme reduces errors to nearly round-off error even on coarse grids (2 degrees). Furthermore, the Rossby-Haurwitz wave preserves its shape for over 90 days. To test the non-oscillation property, we designed a cylinder dam break case. The WENO approach effectively suppresses non-physical oscillation, and the genuine two-dimensional reconstruction exhibits significantly better isotropy than the dimension-by-dimension scheme.</description>
