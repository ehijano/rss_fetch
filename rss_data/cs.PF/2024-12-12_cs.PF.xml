      <title>Pattern Tree: Enhancing Efficiency in Quantum Circuit Optimization Based on Pattern-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit optimization is essential for improving the performance of quantum algorithms, particularly on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices with limited qubit connectivity and high error rates. Pattern matching has proven to be an effective technique for identifying and optimizing subcircuits by replacing them with functionally equivalent, efficient versions, including reducing circuit depth and facilitating platform portability. However, existing approaches face challenges in handling large-scale circuits and numerous transformation rules, often leading to redundant matches and increased compilation time. In this study, we propose a novel framework for quantum circuit optimization based on pattern matching to enhance its efficiency. Observing redundancy in applying existing transformation rules, our method employs a pattern tree structure to organize these rules, reducing redundant operations during the execution of the pattern-matching algorithm and improving matching efficiency. We design and implement a compilation framework to demonstrate the practicality of the pattern tree approach. Experimental results show that pattern-tree-based pattern matching can reduce execution time by an average of 20% on a well-accepted benchmark set. Furthermore, we analyze how to build a pattern tree to maximize the optimization of compilation time. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach has the potential to optimize compilation time by 90%.</description>

      <title>Overview of Web Application Performance Optimization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During its thirty years of existence, the World Wide Web has helped to transform the world and create digital economies. Although it started as a global information exchange, it has become the most significant available application platform on top of its initial target. One of the side effects of this evolution was perhaps suboptimal ways to deliver content over the web, leading to wasted resources and business through lost conversions. Technically speaking, there are many ways to improve the performance of web applications. In this article, we examine the currently available options and the latest trends related to improving web application performance.</description>
