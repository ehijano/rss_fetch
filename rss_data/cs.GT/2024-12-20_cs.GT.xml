      <title>Commitment to Sparse Strategies in Two-Player Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist, they may exhibit dense support, making them difficult to understand and execute in some applications. In this paper, we study $k$-sparse commitments in games where one player is restricted to mixed strategies with support size at most $k$. Finding $k$-sparse commitments is known to be computationally hard. We start by showing several structural properties of $k$-sparse solutions, including that the optimal support may vary dramatically as $k$ increases. These results suggest that naive greedy or double-oracle-based approaches are unlikely to yield practical algorithms. We then develop a simple approach based on mixed integer linear programs (MILPs) for zero-sum games, general-sum Stackelberg games, and various forms of structured sparsity. We also propose practical algorithms for cases where one or both players have large (i.e., practically innumerable) action sets, utilizing a combination of MILPs and incremental strategy generation. We evaluate our methods on synthetic and real-world scenarios based on security applications. In both settings, we observe that even for small support sizes, we can obtain more than $90\%$ of the true Nash value while maintaining a reasonable runtime, demonstrating the significance of our formulation and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Characterising Simulation-Based Program Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Tennenholtz's program equilibrium, players of a game submit programs to play on their behalf. Each program receives the other programs' source code and outputs an action. This can model interactions involving AI agents, mutually transparent institutions, or commitments. Tennenholtz (2004) proves a folk theorem for program games, but the equilibria constructed are very brittle. We therefore consider simulation-based programs -- i.e., programs that work by running opponents' programs. These are relatively robust (in particular, two programs that act the same are treated the same) and are more practical than proof-based approaches. Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot is such an approach. Unfortunately, it is not generally applicable to games of three or more players, and only allows for a limited range of equilibria in two player games. In this paper, we propose a generalisation to Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot. We prove a folk theorem for our programs in a setting with access to a shared source of randomness. We then characterise their equilibria in a setting without shared randomness. Both with and without shared randomness, we achieve a much wider range of equilibria than Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot. Finally, we explore the limits of simulation-based program equilibrium, showing that the Tennenholtz folk theorem cannot be attained by simulation-based programs without access to shared randomness.</description>

      <title>Fair Division with Social Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of fair division of indivisible goods when the allocation of goods impacts society. Specifically, we introduce a second valuation function for each agent, determining the social impact of allocating a good to the agent. Such impact is considered desirable for the society -- the higher, the better. Our goal is to understand how to allocate goods fairly from the agents' perspective while maintaining society as happy as possible. To this end, we measure the impact on society using the utilitarian social welfare and provide both possibility and impossibility results. Our findings reveal that achieving good approximations, better than linear in the number of agents, is not possible while ensuring fairness to the agents. These impossibility results can be attributed to the fact that agents are completely unconscious of their social impact. Consequently, we explore scenarios where agents are socially aware, by introducing related fairness notions, and demonstrate that an appropriate definition of fairness aligns with the goal of maximizing the social objective.</description>

      <title>Equal Merit Does Not Imply Equality: Discrimination at Equilibrium in a Hiring Market with Symmetric Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has grown in popularity to help assign resources and make decisions about users, which can result in discrimination. This includes hiring markets, where employers have increasingly been interested in using automated tools to help hire candidates. In response, there has been significant effort to understand and mitigate the sources of discrimination in these tools. However, previous work has largely assumed that discrimination, in any area of ML, is the result of some initial \textit{unequal distribution of resources} across groups: One group is on average less qualified, there is less training data for one group, or the classifier is less accurate on one group, etc. However, recent work have suggested that there are other sources of discrimination, such as relational inequality, that are notably non-distributional. First, we show consensus in strategy choice is a non-distributional source of inequality at equilibrium in games: We provide subgame perfect equilibria in a simple sequential model of a hiring market with Rubinstein-style bargaining between firms and candidates that exhibits asymmetric wages resulting from differences in agents' threat strategies during bargaining. Second, we give an initial analysis of how agents could learn such strategies via convergence of an online learning algorithm to asymmetric equilibria. Ultimately, this work motivates the further study of endogenous, possibly non-distributional, mechanisms of inequality in ML.</description>

      <title>Agent-Temporal Credit Assignment for Optimal Policy Preservation in Sparse Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent environments, agents often struggle to learn optimal policies due to sparse or delayed global rewards, particularly in long-horizon tasks where it is challenging to evaluate actions at intermediate time steps. We introduce Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution (TAR$^2$), a novel approach designed to address the agent-temporal credit assignment problem by redistributing sparse rewards both temporally and across agents. TAR$^2$ decomposes sparse global rewards into time-step-specific rewards and calculates agent-specific contributions to these rewards. We theoretically prove that TAR$^2$ is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. Empirical results demonstrate that TAR$^2$ stabilizes and accelerates the learning process. Additionally, we show that when TAR$^2$ is integrated with single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, it performs as well as or better than traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>Cherry on the Cake: Fairness is NOT an Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Fair AI literature, the practice of maliciously creating unfair models that nevertheless satisfy fairness constraints is known as "cherry-picking". A cherry-picking model is a model that makes mistakes on purpose, selecting bad individuals from a minority class instead of better candidates from the same minority. The model literally cherry-picks whom to select to superficially meet the fairness constraints while making minimal changes to the unfair model. This practice has been described as "blatantly unfair" and has a negative impact on already marginalized communities, undermining the intended purpose of fairness measures specifically designed to protect these communities. A common assumption is that cherry-picking arises solely from malicious intent and that models designed only to optimize fairness metrics would avoid this behavior. We show that this is not the case: models optimized to minimize fairness metrics while maximizing performance are often forced to cherry-pick to some degree. In other words, cherry-picking might be an inevitable outcome of the optimization process itself. To demonstrate this, we use tools from fair cake-cutting, a mathematical subfield that studies the problem of fairly dividing a resource, referred to as the "cake," among a number of participants. This concept is connected to supervised multi-label classification: any dataset can be thought of as a cake that needs to be distributed among different labels, and the model is the function that divides the cake. We adapt these classical results for machine learning and demonstrate how this connection can be prolifically used for fairness and classification in general.</description>
