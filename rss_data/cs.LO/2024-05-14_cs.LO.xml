      <title>A categorical account of composition methods in logic (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a categorical theory of the composition methods in finite model theory -- a key technique enabling modular reasoning about complex structures by building them out of simpler components. The crucial results required by the composition methods are Feferman--Vaught--Mostowski (FVM) type theorems, which characterize how logical equivalence behaves under composition and transformation of models.
  Our results are developed by extending the recently introduced game comonad semantics for model comparison games. This level of abstraction allow us to give conditions yielding FVM type results in a uniform way. Our theorems are parametric in the classes of models, logics and operations involved. Furthermore, they naturally account for the existential and positive existential fragments, and extensions with counting quantifiers of these logics. We also reveal surprising connections between FVM type theorems, and classical concepts in the theory of monads.
  We illustrate our methods by recovering many classical theorems of practical interest, including a refinement of a previous result by Dawar, Severini, and Zapata concerning the 3-variable counting logic and cospectrality. To highlight the importance of our techniques being parametric in the logic of interest, we prove a family of FVM theorems for products of structures, uniformly in the logic in question, which cannot be done using specific game arguments.
  This is an extended version of the LiCS 2023 conference paper of the same name.</description>

      <title>TLINet: Differentiable Neural Network Temporal Logic Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in extracting formal descriptions of the system behaviors from data. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is an expressive formal language used to describe spatial-temporal properties with interpretability. This paper introduces TLINet, a neural-symbolic framework for learning STL formulas. The computation in TLINet is differentiable, enabling the usage of off-the-shelf gradient-based tools during the learning process. In contrast to existing approaches, we introduce approximation methods for max operator designed specifically for temporal logic-based gradient techniques, ensuring the correctness of STL satisfaction evaluation. Our framework not only learns the structure but also the parameters of STL formulas, allowing flexible combinations of operators and various logical structures. We validate TLINet against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that our approach outperforms these baselines in terms of interpretability, compactness, rich expressibility, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A cyclic proof system for Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT for short) is an efficient fragment of Kleene Algebra with Tests, suitable for reasoning about simple imperative while-programs. Following earlier work by Das and Pous on Kleene Algebra, we study GKAT from a proof-theoretical perspective. The deterministic nature of GKAT allows for a non-well-founded sequent system whose set of regular proofs is complete with respect to the guarded language model. This is unlike the situation with Kleene Algebra, where hypersequents are required. Moreover, the decision procedure induced by proof search runs in NLOGSPACE, whereas that of Kleene Algebra is in PSPACE.</description>

      <title>Non-Rigid Designators in Modal and Temporal Free Description Logics (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Definite descriptions, such as 'the General Chair of KR 2024', are a semantically transparent device for object identification in knowledge representation. In first-order modal logic, definite descriptions have been widely investigated for their non-rigidity, which allows them to designate different objects (or none at all) at different states. We propose expressive modal description logics with non-rigid definite descriptions and names, and investigate decidability and complexity of the satisfaction problem. We first systematically link satisfiability for the one-variable fragment of first-order modal logic with counting to our modal description logics. Then, we prove a promising NEXPTIME-completeness result for concept satisfiability for the fundamental epistemic multi-agent logic $\mathbf{S5}^{n}$ and its neighbours, and show that some expressive logics that are undecidable with constant domain become decidable (but Ackermann-hard) with expanding domains. Finally, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of decidability of temporal logics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Synthesis of Symbolic Distributed Protocols by Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel and efficient method for synthesis of parameterized distributed protocols by sketching. Our method is both syntax-guided and counterexample-guided, and utilizes a fast equivalence reduction technique that enables efficient completion of protocol sketches, often significantly reducing the search space of candidate completions by several orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, our tool, Scythe, is the first synthesis tool for the widely used specification language TLA+. We evaluate Scythe on a diverse benchmark of distributed protocols, demonstrating the ability to synthesize a large scale distributed Raft-based dynamic reconfiguration protocol beyond the scale of what existing synthesis techniques can handle.</description>

      <title>On the Decidability of Monadic Second-Order Logic with Arithmetic Predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decidability of the monadic second-order (MSO) theory of the structure $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;,P_1, \ldots,P_k \rangle$, for various unary predicates $P_1,\ldots,P_k \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. We focus in particular on "arithmetic" predicates arising in the study of linear recurrence sequences, such as fixed-base powers $\mathsf{Pow}_k = \{k^n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, $k$-th powers $\mathsf{N}_k = \{n^k : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, and the set of terms of the Fibonacci sequence $\mathsf{Fib} = \{0,1,2,3,5,8,13,\ldots\}$ (and similarly for other linear recurrence sequences having a single, non-repeated, dominant characteristic root). We obtain several new unconditional and conditional decidability results, a select sample of which are the following:
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;,\mathsf{Pow}_2, \mathsf{Fib} \rangle$ is decidable;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, \mathsf{Pow}_2, \mathsf{Pow}_3, \mathsf{Pow}_6 \rangle$ is decidable;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, \mathsf{Pow}_2, \mathsf{Pow}_3, \mathsf{Pow}_5 \rangle$ is decidable assuming Schanuel's conjecture;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, \mathsf{Pow}_4, \mathsf{N}_2 \rangle$ is decidable;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, \mathsf{Pow}_2, \mathsf{N}_2 \rangle$ is Turing-equivalent to the MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;,S \rangle$, where $S$ is the predicate corresponding to the binary expansion of $\sqrt{2}$. (As the binary expansion of $\sqrt{2}$ is widely believed to be normal, the corresponding MSO theory is in turn expected to be decidable.)
  These results are obtained by exploiting and combining techniques from dynamical systems, number theory, and automata theory.</description>

      <title>A Nominal Approach to Probabilistic Separation Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, there is a gap between the tools used by probability theorists and those used in formal reasoning about probabilistic programs. On the one hand, a probability theorist decomposes probabilistic state along the simple and natural product of probability spaces. On the other hand, recently developed probabilistic separation logics decompose state via relatively unfamiliar measure-theoretic constructions for computing unions of sigma-algebras and probability measures. We bridge the gap between these two perspectives by showing that these two methods of decomposition are equivalent up to a suitable equivalence of categories. Our main result is a probabilistic analog of the classic equivalence between the category of nominal sets and the Schanuel topos. Through this equivalence, we validate design decisions in prior work on probabilistic separation logic and create new connections to nominal-set-like models of probability.</description>

      <title>Possibility Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional semantics for classical logic and its extensions, such as modal logic, propositions are interpreted as subsets of a set, as in discrete duality, or as clopen sets of a Stone space, as in topological duality. A point in such a set can be viewed as a "possible world," with the key property of a world being primeness--a world makes a disjunction true only if it makes one of the disjuncts true--which classically implies totality--for each proposition, a world either makes the proposition true or makes its negation true. This chapter surveys a more general approach to logical semantics, known as possibility semantics, which replaces possible worlds with possibly partial "possibilities." In classical possibility semantics, propositions are interpreted as regular open sets of a poset, as in set-theoretic forcing, or as compact regular open sets of an upper Vietoris space, as in the recent theory of "choice-free Stone duality." The elements of these sets, viewed as possibilities, may be partial in the sense of making a disjunction true without settling which disjunct is true. We explain how possibilities may be used in semantics for classical logic and modal logics and generalized to semantics for intuitionistic logics. The goals are to overcome or deepen incompleteness results for traditional semantics, to avoid the nonconstructivity of traditional semantics, and to provide richer structures for the interpretation of new languages.</description>

      <title>A Primer for Preferential Non-Monotonic Propositional Team Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers KLM-style preferential non-monotonic reasoning in the setting of propositional team semantics. We show that team-based propositional logics naturally give rise to cumulative non-monotonic entailment relations. Motivated by the non-classical interpretation of disjunction in team semantics, we give a precise characterization for preferential models for propositional dependence logic satisfying all of System P postulates. Furthermore, we show how classical entailment and dependence logic entailment can be expressed in terms of non-trivial preferential models.</description>

      <title>Monoidal closure of Grothendieck constructions via $\Sigma$-tractible monoidal structures and Dialectica formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the categorical structure of the Grothendieck construction of an indexed category $\mathcal{L}:\mathcal{C}^{op}\to\mathbf{CAT}$ and characterise fibred limits, colimits, and monoidal structures. Next, we give sufficient conditions for the monoidal closure of the total category $\Sigma_\mathcal{C} \mathcal{L}$ of a Grothendieck construction of an indexed category $\mathcal{L}:\mathcal{C}^{op}\to\mathbf{CAT}$. Our analysis is a generalization of G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, and it relies on a novel notion of $\Sigma$-tractible monoidal structure. As we will see, $\Sigma$-tractible coproducts simultaneously generalize cocartesian coclosed structures, biproducts and extensive coproducts. We analyse when the closed structure is fibred -- usually it is not.</description>

      <title>Slice closures of indexed languages and word equations with counting constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indexed languages are a classical notion in formal language theory. As the language equivalent of second-order pushdown automata, they have received considerable attention in higher-order model checking. Unfortunately, counting properties are notoriously difficult to decide for indexed languages: So far, all results about non-regular counting properties show undecidability.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of slice closures of (Parikh images of) indexed languages. A slice is a set of vectors of natural numbers such that membership of $u,u+v,u+w$ implies membership of $u+v+w$. Our main result is that given an indexed language $L$, one can compute a semilinear representation of the smallest slice containing $L$'s Parikh image.
  We present two applications. First, one can compute the set of all affine relations satisfied by the Parikh image of an indexed language. In particular, this answers affirmatively a question by Kobayashi: Is it decidable whether in a given indexed language, every word has the same number of $a$'s as $b$'s.
  As a second application, we show decidability of (systems of) word equations with rational constraints and a class of counting constraints: These allow us to look for solutions where a counting function (defined by an automaton) is not zero. For example, one can decide whether a word equation with rational constraints has a solution where the number of occurrences of $a$ differs between variables $X$ and $Y$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Programming for Symbolic Boolean Realizability and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent progress in dynamic programming approaches for weighted model counting, we investigate a dynamic-programming approach in the context of boolean realizability and synthesis, which takes a conjunctive-normal-form boolean formula over input and output variables, and aims at synthesizing witness functions for the output variables in terms of the inputs. We show how graded project-join trees, obtained via tree decomposition, can be used to compute a BDD representing the realizability set for the input formulas in a bottom-up order. We then show how the intermediate BDDs generated during realizability checking phase can be applied to synthesizing the witness functions in a top-down manner. An experimental evaluation of a solver -- DPSynth -- based on these ideas demonstrates that our approach for Boolean realizabilty and synthesis has superior time and space performance over a heuristics-based approach using same symbolic representations. We discuss the advantage on scalability of the new approach, and also investigate our findings on the performance of the DP framework.</description>

      <title>The Pebble-Relation Comonad in Finite Model Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.08196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pebbling comonad, introduced by Abramsky, Dawar and Wang, provides a categorical interpretation for the k-pebble games from finite model theory. The coKleisli category of the pebbling comonad specifies equivalences under different fragments and extensions of infinitary k-variable logic. Moreover, the coalgebras over this pebbling comonad characterise treewidth and correspond to tree decompositions. In this paper we introduce the pebble-relation comonad, which characterises pathwidth and whose coalgebras correspond to path decompositions. We further show that the existence of a coKleisli morphism in this comonad is equivalent to truth preservation in the restricted conjunction fragment of k-variable infinitary logic. We do this using Dalmau's pebble-relation game and an equivalent all-in-one pebble game. We then provide a similar treatment to the corresponding coKleisli isomorphisms via a bijective version of the all-in-one pebble game. Finally, we show as a consequence a new Lov\'asz-type theorem relating pathwidth to the restricted conjunction fragment of k-variable infinitary logic with counting quantifiers.</description>

Abstract: We present fully abstract encodings of the call-by-name and call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus into HOcore, a minimal higher-order process calculus with no name restriction. We consider several equivalences on the $\lambda$-calculus side -- normal-form bisimilarity, applicative bisimilarity, and contextual equivalence -- that we internalize into abstract machines in order to prove full abstraction of the encodings. We also demonstrate that this technique scales to the $\lambda\mu$-calculus, i.e., a standard extension of the $\lambda$-calculus with control operators.</description>

      <title>PFL: a Probabilistic Logic for Fault Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety-critical infrastructures must operate in a safe and reliable way. Fault tree analysis is a widespread method used for risk assessment of these systems: fault trees (FTs) are required by, e.g., the Federal Aviation Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In spite of their popularity, little work has been done on formulating structural queries about FT and analyzing these, e.g., when evaluating potential scenarios, and to give practitioners instruments to formulate queries on FTs in an understandable yet powerful way. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by extending BFL [32], a logic that reasons about Boolean FTs. To do so, we introduce a Probabilistic Fault tree Logic (PFL). PFL is a simple, yet expressive logic that supports easier formulation of complex scenarios and specification of FT properties that comprise probabilities. Alongside PFL, we present LangPFL, a domain specific language to further ease property specification. We showcase PFL and LangPFL by applying them to a COVID-19 related FT and to a FT for an oil/gas pipeline. Finally, we present theory and model checking algorithms based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs).</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-Regular Extensions of Propositional Dynamic Logic with Description-Logics Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09913v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of non-regular path expressions on the decidability of satisfiability checking and querying in description logics extending ALC. Our primary objects of interest are ALCreg and ALCvpl, the extensions of with path expressions employing, respectively, regular and visibly-pushdown languages. The first one, ALCreg, is a notational variant of the well-known Propositional Dynamic Logic of Fischer and Ladner. The second one, ALCvpl, was introduced and investigated by Loding and Serre in 2007. The logic ALCvpl generalises many known decidable non-regular extensions of ALCreg.
  We provide a series of undecidability results. First, we show that decidability of the concept satisfiability problem for ALCvpl is lost upon adding the seemingly innocent Self operator. Second, we establish undecidability for the concept satisfiability problem for ALCvpl extended with nominals. Interestingly, our undecidability proof relies only on one single non-regular (visibly-pushdown) language, namely on r#s# := { r^n s^n | n in N } for fixed role names r and s. Finally, in contrast to the classical database setting, we establish undecidability of query entailment for queries involving non-regular atoms from r#s#, already in the case of ALC-TBoxes.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability modulo theories for verifying MILP certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correctness of results returned from mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solvers is highly desirable, particularly in the context of applications such as hardware verification, compiler optimization, or machine-assisted theorem proving. To this end, VIPR is the first recently proposed certificate format for answers produced by MILP solvers. We design a schema to encode VIPR's inference rules as Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) instances and show the equivalence of the certificates' correctness and the satisfiability of the corresponding SMT instances. In addition, we implement this schema with and without parallelization in a checker for VIPR certificates and test the viability of this approach on benchmark instances found in the literature with the cvc5 solver.</description>

      <title>Canonical Decision Diagrams Modulo Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) are powerful tools to represent effectively propositional formulas, which are largely used in many domains, in particular in formal verification and in knowledge compilation. Some forms of DDs (e.g., OBDDs, SDDs) are canonical, that is, (under given conditions on the atom list) they univocally represent equivalence classes of formulas. Given the limited expressiveness of propositional logic, a few attempts to leverage DDs to SMT level have been presented in the literature. Unfortunately, these techniques still suffer from some limitations: most procedures are theory-specific; some produce theory DDs (T-DDs) which do not univocally represent T-valid formulas or T-inconsistent formulas; none of these techniques provably produces theory-canonical T-DDs, which (under given conditions on the T-atom list) univocally represent T-equivalence classes of formulas. Also, these procedures are not easy to implement, and very few implementations are actually available. In this paper, we present a novel very-general technique to leverage DDs to SMT level, which has several advantages: it is very easy to implement on top of an AllSMT solver and a DD package, which are used as blackboxes; it works for every form of DDs and every theory, or combination thereof, supported by the AllSMT solver; it produces theory-canonical T-DDs if the propositional DD is canonical. We have implemented a prototype tool for both T-OBDDs and T-SDDs on top of OBDD and SDD packages and the MathSAT SMT solver. Some preliminary empirical evaluation supports the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Between proof construction and SAT-solving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical satisfiability problem (SAT) is used as a natural and general tool to express and solve combinatorial problems that are in NP. We postulate that provability for implicational intuitionistic propositional logic (IIPC) can serve as a similar natural tool to express problems in Pspace. This approach can be particularly convenient for two reasons. One is that provability in full IPC (with all connectives) can be reduced to provability of implicational formulas of order three. Another advantage is a convenient interpretation in terms of simple alternating automata. Additionally, we distinguish some natural subclasses of IIPC corresponding to the complexity classes NP and co-NP. Our experimental results show that a simple decision procedure requires a significant amount of time only in a small fraction of cases.</description>

      <title>On guarded extensions of MMSNP</title>

Abstract: We investigate logics and classes of problems below Fagin's existential second-order logic (ESO) and above Feder and Vardi's logic for constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), the so called monotone monadic SNP without inequality (MMSNP). It is known that MMSNP has a dichotomy between P and NP-complete but the removal of any of these three restrictions imposed on SNP yields a logic that is Ptime equivalent to ESO: so by Ladner's theorem we have three stronger sibling logics that are nondichotomic above MMSNP. In this paper, we explore the area between these four logics, mostly by considering guarded extensions of MMSNP, with the ultimate goal being to obtain logics above MMSNP that exhibit such a dichotomy.</description>

      <title>State-based Modal Logics for Free Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mathematical properties of bilateral state-based modal logic (BSML), a modal logic employing state-based semantics (also known as team semantics), which has been used to account for free choice inferences and related linguistic phenomena. This logic extends classical modal logic with a nonemptiness atom which is true in a state if and only if the state is nonempty. We introduce two extensions of BSML and show that the extensions are expressively complete, and develop natural deduction axiomatizations for the three logics.</description>

      <title>SAT, Gadgets, Max2XOR, and Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Annealers are basically quantum computers that with high probability can optimize certain quadratic functions on Boolean variables in constant time. These functions are basically the Hamiltonian of Ising models that reach the ground energy state, with a high probability, after an annealing process. They have been proposed as a way to solve SAT.
  These Hamiltonians can be seen as Max2XOR problems, i.e. as the problem of finding an assignment that maximizes the number of XOR clauses of at most 2 variables that are satisfied. In this paper, we present several gadgets to reduce SAT to Max2XOR. We show how they can be used to translate SAT instances to initial configurations of a quantum annealer.</description>
