      <title>Scarcity of partition congruences on semiprime progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work with Raum the authors considered congruences for the ordinary partition function $p(n)$ of the form $p(\ell Q^r n+\beta)\equiv 0\pmod\ell$ where $\ell, Q\geq 5$ are prime and $r\in \{1,2\}$, and proved a number of results which show that such congruences are scarce in a precise sense. Here we improve one of our results when $r=1$; in particular we prove (outside of trivial cases) that the set of primes $Q$ such that there exists $\beta\in \mathbb{Z}$ with $p(\ell Q n+\beta)\equiv 0\pmod \ell$ for all $n$ has density zero. The proof involves a modification of part of our previous argument and an application of a recent theorem of Dicks regarding modular forms of half-integral weight and level one modulo $\ell$.</description>

      <title>Good Integers: A Comprehensive Review with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nonzero coprime integers $a$ and $b$, a positive integer $\ell$ is said to be \emph{good with respect to $a$ and $b$} if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $\ell$ divides $a^{k} + b^{k}$. The concept of good integers has been the subject of continuous investigation since the 1990s due to their elegant number-theoretic properties and their significant applications in various areas, particularly in coding theory. This paper provides a comprehensive review of good integers, emphasizing both their theoretical foundations and their practical implications. We first revisit the fundamental number-theoretic properties of good integers and present their characterizations in a systematic manner. The exposition is enriched with well-structured algorithms and illustrative diagrams that facilitate their computation and classification. Subsequently, we explore applications of good integers in the study of algebraic coding theory. In particular, their roles in the characterization, construction, and enumeration of self-dual cyclic codes and complementary dual cyclic codes are discussed in detail. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the theory. This review not only consolidates existing results but also highlights the unifying role of good integers in bridging number theory and coding theory.</description>

      <title>Mod $\ell$ non-vanishing of self-dual Hecke $L$-values over CM fields and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$ be a self-dual Hecke character over a CM field $K$. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of the maximal totally real subfield $F$ of $K$ and $\Gamma_{\mathfrak{p}}$ the Galois group of the maximal anticyclotomic ${\mathbb{Z}}_{p}^{deg \mathfrak{p}}$-extension of $K$ unramified outside $\mathfrak{p}$. We prove that $$L(1,\lambda\nu)\neq 0$$ for all but finitely many finite order characters $\nu$ of $\Gamma_{\mathfrak{p}}$ such that $\epsilon(\lambda\nu)=+1$. For an ordinary prime $\ell$ with respect to the CM quadratic extension $K/F$, we also determine the $\ell$-adic valuation of the normalised Hecke $L$-values $L^{{\mathrm{alg}}}(1,\lambda\nu)$. As an application, we complete Hsieh's proof of Eisenstein congruence divisibility towards the CM Iwasawa main conjecture over $K$.
  Our approach and results complement the prior work initiated by Hida's ideas on the arithmetic of Hilbert modular Eisenstein series, studied via mod $\ell$ analogue of the Andr\'e--Oort conjecture. The previous results established the non-vanishing only for a Zariski dense subset of characters $\nu$. Our approach is based on the arithmetic of a CM modular form on a Shimura set, studied via arithmetic of the CM field and Ratner's ergodicity of unipotent flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups, we compute the dimension of the reduced Emerton-Gee stacks, and give an explicit description of their top-dimensional Chow group. Our results are unconditional when $p\neq 2$.
  The main innovation is a new method for analyzing the vanishing locus of Galois cup products valued in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Two-color partitions and overpartitions: a combinatorial proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: George Andrews and Mohamed El Bachraoui recently explored identities for two-color partitions. In particular, they studied the connection between two-colored partitions and overpartitions. Their proofs were analytical, but they conjectured combinatorial proofs of their results. In this paper we use two-modular diagrams to give a combinatorial proof of their main result.</description>

      <title>On a non-abelian analogue of a conjecture of Michael Stoll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a non-abelian generalisation of a conjecture of Stoll, which conjecturally describes the structure of the loci cut out by Kim's method of non-abelian Chabauty. We prove the rank 0 quadratic case of this conjecture, which in particular determines the structure of the quadratic Chabauty locus for once-punctured elliptic curves of rank 0. The proof involves using a variant of the geometric quadratic Chabauty method of Edixhoven and Lido to reduce to an unlikely intersections problem, and ultimately to known results about the relative Manin--Mumford Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Tight Quantum-Security Bounds and Parameter Optimization for SPHINCS+ and NTRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The imminent threat of quantum computing necessitates quantum-resistant cryptosystems. This paper establishes tight security bounds for two NIST PQC finalists: SPHINCS+ (hash-based) and NTRU (lattice-based). Our key contributions include: (1) A quantum attack model incorporating decoherence effects ($\tau_d$) and parallelization limits; (2) Improved entropy concentration inequalities reducing SPHINCS+ parameters by 15-20\%; (3) Optimized NTRU lattice parameters via quantum lattice entropy $H_Q(\Lambda)$; (4) Tightened NTRU-to-LWE reduction with polynomial-factor improvement. Theoretical results demonstrate significant security enhancement over existing constructions, providing implementable parameters for standardization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the transfer operators defined over $\mathbb{C}_p$-valued analytic functions for subhyperbolic rational maps on $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and showed that the corresponding Ruelle's zeta functions are meromorphic on $\mathbb{C}_p$. We also used $\mathbb{R}$-valued transfer operators to study the shape of the corresponding Julia sets, and proved a Levin-Sodin-Yuditski type identity for general rational maps on $\mathbb{C}_p$. In all the results above, $\mathbb{Q}_p$ can be replaced with any non-Archimedean local field with characteristic $0$, and $\mathbb{C}_p$ the metric completion of its algebraic closure.</description>

      <title>Tridendriform and dendriform Zeta Values from Schroeder trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To build new generalisations of Multiple Zeta Values, we define new spaces of formal series and formal integrals. We show that they are tridendriform and dendriform algebras. This allows us to reinterpret the fact that Multiple Zeta Values are algebra morphisms for shuffles of words in terms of finer tridendriform and dendriform structures. Applying universal properties of Schroeder trees we obtain generalisations of Multiple Zeta Values that are algebra morphisms for associative products. Hence we find new properties of Arborified Zeta Values and state how this enables the computation of some Shintani Zeta Values.</description>

      <title>Hyperbinary partitions and q-deformed rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hyperbinary partition of the nonnegative integer n is a partition where every part is a power of 2 and every part appears at most twice. We give three applications of the length generating function for such partitions, denoted by h_q(n). Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko defined the q-analogue of a rational number [r/s]_q in various ways, most of which depend directly or indirectly on the continued fraction expansion of r/s. As our first application we show that [r/s]_q = q h_q(n-1)/h_q(n) where r/s occurs as the nth entry in the Calkin-Wilf enumeration of the non-negative rationals. Next we consider fence posets which are those which can be obtained from a sequence of chains by alternately pasting together maxima and minima. For every n we show there is a fence poset F(n) whose lattice of order ideals is isomorphic to the poset of hyperbinary partitions of n ordered by refinement. For our last application, Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko also showed that [r/s]_q can be computed by taking products of certain matrices which are q-analogues of the standard generators for the special linear group SL(2,R). We express the entries of these products in terms of the polynomials h_q(n).</description>

      <title>Black Hole Zeckendorf Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zeckendorf proved that every positive integer can be written as a decomposition of non-adjacent Fibonacci numbers. Baird-Smith, Epstein, Flint, and Miller converted the process of decomposing an integer $n$ into a 2-player game, using the moves of $F_i + F_{i-1} = F_{i+1}$ and $2F_i = F_{i+1} + F_{i-2}$, where $F_i$ is the $ith$ Fibonacci number. They showed non-constructively that for $n \neq 2$, Player 2 has a winning strategy: a constructive solution remains unknown.
  We expand on this by investigating ``black hole'' variants of this game. The $F_m$ Black Hole Zeckendorf game is played with any $n$ but solely in columns $F_i$ for $i &lt; m$. Gameplay is similar to the original Zeckendorf game, except any piece that would be placed on $F_i$ for $i \geq m$ is locked out in a ``black hole'' and removed from play. With these constraints, we analyze the games with black holes on $F_3$ and $F_4$ and construct a solution for specific configurations, using a non-constructive proof to lead to a constructive one. We also examine a pre-game in which players take turns placing down $n$ pieces in the outermost columns before the decomposition phase, and find constructive solutions for any $n$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the sign constancy for the values of certain weighted summatory functions of the von Mangoldt function implies the Riemann hypothesis or the generalized Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions. While such sign constancy is challenging to establish individually, we prove that the summatory functions under study have constant signs on average.</description>

      <title>The Habiro ring of a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Habiro ring of a number field $\mathbb{K}$ and modules over it graded by $K_3(\mathbb{K})$. Elements of these modules are collections of power series at each complex root of unity that arithmetically glue with each other after applying a Frobenius endomorphism, and after dividing at each prime by a collection of series that depends solely on an element of the Bloch group.
  The main theorems of this paper concern number fields, their algebraic $K$-theory and its regulator maps (Borel, $p$-adic and \'etale), whereas the explicit collections of series are defined by a careful algebraic analysis of the infinite Pochhammer symbol at roots of unity.
  The origin of the above mentioned power series comes from perturbative Chern--Simons theory and by expansions of the admissible series of Kontsevich--Soibelman, both ultimately related to the infinite Pochhammer symbol. This link suggests that some Donaldson-Thomas invariants have arithmetic meaning and that some elements of the Habiro ring of a number field have enumerative meaning.
  Added subsection 1.1 explaining what the paper is about and subsection 1.8 explaining the relation to perturbative complex Chern-Simons theory.</description>

Abstract: Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer and let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. We prove that the set of ternary $n$-ic forms with coefficients in $\mathcal{O}_K$ and fixed nonzero discriminant, breaks up into finitely many $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathcal{O}_K)$-orbits. This generalizes a result of Birch--Merriman in the binary forms case. We also prove a similar finiteness result on the $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathcal{O}_K)$-orbits of the 27-dimensional representation of $\mathrm{GL}_3$ with highest weight $(4, 2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to determine the Galois group of an irreducible monic polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree at most five. Following work of Conrad, Dummit, and Stauduhar this comes down to answering two questions: Is a given integer a square? and Does a given polynomial have an integral root? Since these are both easily addressed with a calculator, our algorithm amounts to Galois theory by calculator. For example, we have an implementation at Desmos.com. In an appendix we present a simplified version of our algorithm, suitable for a handheld calculator, in case $f(x) = x^n + px + q$.</description>

      <title>Motivic Coh and Quot zeta functions of singular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general and effective algebraic framework for enumerating finite-length quotients of a torsion-free sheaf of arbitrary rank (the Quot zeta function) and finite-length coherent sheaves (the Coh zeta function) over reduced singular curves. We show that the Coh zeta function can be recovered as a transparent high-rank limit of Quot zeta functions. We prove that Quot zeta functions are motivically rational, using a novel parametrization and the geometry of affine Grassmannians, and that they satisfy an arbitrary-rank reflection principle, via harmonic analysis. As a first application, we compute explicit formulas for these zeta functions for all $y^2 = x^n$ singularities, revealing a surprising and previously unknown connection to Rogers--Ramanujan type $q$-series. Further applications to the enumerative geometry of affine Springer fibers and commuting varieties are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Using the ratios theorems, we calculate the leading order terms in $N$ for the following averages of the characteristic polynomial and its derivative: $\left&lt; \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right&gt;_{SO(2N)}$ and $\left&lt; \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right&gt;_{USp(2N)}$. Our expression, derived for integer $r$, permits analytic continuation in $r$ and we conjecture that this agrees with the above averages for non-integer exponents. We use this result to obtain an expression for the one level density of the `excised ensemble', a subensemble of $SO(2N)$, to next-to-leading order in $N$. We then present the analogous calculation for the one level density of quadratic twists of elliptic curve $L$-functions, taking into account a number theoretical bound on the central values of the $L$-functions. The method we use to calculate the above random matrix averages uses the contour integral form of the ratios theorems, which are a key tool in the growing literature on averages of characteristic polynomials and their derivatives, and as we evaluate the next-to-leading term for large matrix size $N$, this leads to some multi-dimensional contour integrals that are slightly asymmetric in the integration variables, which might be useful in other work.</description>
