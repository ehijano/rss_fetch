      <title>Electrical switching of an unconventional odd parity magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electron-volt (eV) scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications. A variety of such magnetic states with nontrivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d, g, or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets. Achieving voltage-based control of the nonuniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energyefficient and compact devices for information storage and processing. Spin-spiral type-II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order which directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principle calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type-II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent the first direct observation of unconventional odd-parity magnetism in a spin-spiral type-II multiferroic, and open a new frontier of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets.</description>

      <title>Power Transfer in Magnetoelectric Resonators: a Combined Analytical and Finite Element Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical model for power transfer in a magnetoelectric film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) comprising a piezoelectric-magnetostrictive bilayer. The model describes the power flow between the elastic and magnetic systems, quantifying the transduction efficiency when the FBAR operates as a magnetic transducer. By applying the model to example systems using piezoelectric ScAlN and magnetostrictive CoFeB, Ni, or Terfenol-D layers, we demonstrate the potential for achieving high efficiencies in magnetoelectric transducers, rendering them ideal for efficient ferromagnetic resonance excitation. The validity of the model's assumptions is confirmed through comparison with a numerical finite element resonator model in COMSOL\texttrademark. The finite element model further enables a comprehensive study of the resonator's dynamic behavior, including transient and steady-state regimes, and the identification of resonant frequencies within the system.</description>

      <title>Tunable stacking-driven topological phase transitions in pnictide layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonmagnetic topological insulators (TIs) are known for their robust metallic surface/edge states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry, making them promising candidates for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices. Traditional approaches to realizing TIs have focused on inducing band inversion via strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yet many materials with substantial SOC often remain topologically trivial. In this work, we present a materials-design strategy for engineering topologically non-trivial phases, e.g., quantum spin Hall phases, by vertically stacking topologically trivial Rashba monolayers in an inverted fashion. Using BiSb as a prototype system, we demonstrate that while the BiSb monolayer is topologically trivial (despite having significant SOC), an inverted BiSb-SbBi bilayer configuration realizes a non-trivial topological phase with enhanced spin Hall conductivity. We further reveal a delicate interplay between the SOC strength and the interlayer electron tunneling that governs the emergence of a nontrivial topological phase in the bilayer heterostructure. This phase can be systematically tuned using an external electric field, providing an experimentally accessible means of controlling the system's topology. Our magnetotransport studies further validate this interplay, by revealing g-factor suppression and the emergence a zeroth Landau level. Notably, the inverted bilayer heterostructure exhibits a robust and tunable spin Hall effect, with performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art materials. Thus, our findings unveil an alternative pathway for designing and engineering functional properties in 2D topological systems using topologically trivial constituent monolayers.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of magnetic octupole in periodic crystals and characterization of time-reversal-symmetry breaking antiferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic multipoles have been recognized as order parameters characterizing magnetic structure in solids, with magnetic dipole serving as canonical examples in ferromagnets. Recently, magnetic octupoles have been proposed as the order parameters of time-reversal-symmetry breaking centrosymmetric antiferromagnets exhibiting nonrelativistic spin splitting, which is referred to as ``altermagnet''. However, a gauge-invariant formulation of magnetic octupoles in crystalline solids remains elusive. Here, we present a gauge-invariant expression of spin magnetic octupoles in periodic crystals based on quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. Our expression reveals a contribution from an anisotropic magnetic dipole, which has the same symmetry as conventional spin and orbital magnetic dipoles but carries no net magnetization. We demonstrate that such an anisotropic magnetic dipole acts as an order parameter for antiferromagnets that exhibit the anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Exchange Surface Spin Waves in Type-A van der Waals Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface spin waves in the short-wavelength regime enable ultrafast, nanoscale magnon-based devices. Here we report the emergence of surface spin-wave excitations within the bulk magnon band gap of type-A van der Waals antiferromagnets composed of antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic monolayers. In contrast to the magnetostatic Damon-Eshbach modes in magnetic slabs, these surface waves are pure exchange modes owing to the reduced interlayer exchange coupling at surface layers, and thus persist in ultrathin multilayer stacks and at large wave numbers. We show that they can be efficiently excited by electromagnetic waves, with absorption power comparable to or even exceeding that of bulk modes. Moreover, their magnetic stray fields exhibit pronounced even-odd oscillations with the number of monolayers that should be observable by NV-center magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable polarity inversions and three-fold rotation symmetry of the superconducting diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect is an asymmetry in the critical current with respect to the supercurrent polarity. One impetus driving recent interest in the effect is its dependence on intrinsic or microscopic symmetry breaking mechanisms.
  Here, we study the superconducting diode effect in gated planar Josephson junctions fabricated on a superconductor--semiconductor heterostructure under an in-plane magnetic field.
  We observe two gate-driven inversions of the diode polarity in the vicinity of zero field, as well as a third-harmonic component in the dependence of the diode efficiency on the in-plane field angle.
  We analyze the Lifshitz invariant for an arbitrary spin--orbit coupling and show that multiple polarity inversions are possible in the presence of both linear and cubic Dresselhaus terms, where the Rashba parameter varies monotonically with gate voltage.
  Numerical calculations of the diode efficiency further reveal the presence of higher harmonics in its field-angle dependence in the presence of spin--orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnon behavior in YIG film under microwave excitation using Brillouin light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize conventional wave-vector-resolved Brillouin light scattering technology to investigate the spin wave response in YIG thin films under high-power microwave excitation. By varying the microwave frequency, external bias magnetic field, and in-plane wave vector, in addition to observing the dipole-exchange spin waves excited by parallel parametric pumping, we further observe broadband spin wave excitation within the dipole-exchange spin wave spectrum. This broadband excitation results from the combined effects of parallel and perpendicular parametric pumping, induced by irregularities in the excitation geometry, as well as magnon-magnon scattering arising from the absence of certain spin wave modes. Our findings offer new insights into the mechanisms of energy dissipation and relaxation processes caused by spin wave excitation in magnetic devices operating at high power.</description>

      <title>Towards a $\cos(2\varphi)$ Josephson element using aluminum junctions with well-transmitted channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for fabricating all-aluminum Josephson junctions with highly transmitted conduction channels. Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission junctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting circuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a parity-protected qubit.</description>

      <title>Topological classification and edge states of magnons in honeycomb ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological classification and related edge states of magnons in ferromagnets on honeycomb that can be described by a class of single-particle bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) models. Both single layer and bilayer situations are considered. The calculations show that the existence and related topologies of these edge states are well captured by a class of non-Hermitian single or coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains models H(ky) parameterized by momentum ky, where the edge states can appear as the ground state for some cases. Interestingly, although the eigenproblem of bosonic BdG models is equivalent to the one of non-Hermitian systems, the conventional bulkedge correspondence for Hermitian systems is partially valid. The influence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between next nearest-neighbor spins are also discussed, which break the time-reversal symmetry and lead to a straight connection between edge states for magnonic systems and non-zero Chern number of non-Hermitian bulk two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>On persistent energy currents at equilibrium in non-reciprocal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the mean Poynting vector in global thermal equilibrium, which can be non-zero in non-reciprocal electromagnetic systems. Using dyadic Green's functions and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we provide a general proof that the mean Poynting vector is divergence-free under equilibrium conditions. Relying on this proof, we explicitly demonstrate that for systems where a normal mode expansion of the Green's function is applicable, the divergence of the equilibrium mean Poynting vector vanishes. As concrete examples, we also examine the equilibrium mean Poynting vector near a planar non-reciprocal substrate and in configurations involving an arbitrary number of dipolar non-reciprocal objects in free space. Finally, we argue that the so-called persistent heat current, while present in equilibrium, cannot be detected through out-of-equilibrium heat transfer measurements.</description>

      <title>Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg spectroscopy of a fluxonium quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time-averaged populations obtained for a fluxonium circuit under a large amplitude nonresonant periodic drive. We present numerical simulations of the time evolution which consider the multi-level structure of the driven quantum circuit, looking for a realistic modeling closer to experimental implementations. The Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg spectra show resonances that can be understood as originated from constructive interference favoring transitions to higher levels. For a truncated two-level system (TLS) the resonance patterns can be interpreted using a simplified description of the avoided crossing that takes into account the dynamic phase accumulated at each operation point. For the multilevel case, we derive an effective two-level Hamiltonian using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation starting from the Floquet Hamiltonian in the Sambe space. Our study provides predictive insight into experimental outcomes, offering an intuitive interpretation that could also support the implementation of fast-non-adiabatic single-qubit gates and entangling protocols.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Josephson effect in hybrid superconductor-hole systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider hybrid systems consisting of a hole-doped semiconductor coupled to electronic states of finite-size superconductors, where the opposite sign of the masses in the two subsystems give rise to insulating gaps at subband anticrossings. Consequently, increasing the coupling strength to the superconductor can paradoxically suppress the proximity-induced superconductivity in the semiconductor by enhancing these insulating gaps. We demonstrate that the presence of such induced insulating gaps leads to a characteristic anomalous behavior of the critical supercurrent in Josephson junctions based on these hybrid structures. Our findings provide important insights for the design of robust quantum computing platforms utilizing hybrid superconductor-hole systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Band Exact Diagonalization and an Iteration Approach to Hunt For Fractional Chern Insulators in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a multi-band exact diagonalization (ED) study of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene twisted on hexagonal boron nitride with a focus on fractional Chern insulators (FCI) in systems with weak moir\'e gaps, complementing the results of [Yu et al., arXiv:2407.13770]. We consider both the charge-neutrality (CN) and average (AVE) interaction schemes. Saliently and surprisingly, we now find using the particle entanglement spectrum that the FCI at filling factor 1/3 in the CN scheme predicted by single-(Hartree-Fock) band ED is unstable towards a transition to charge density wave once a small fraction of electrons is allowed to occupy the higher bands. Meanwhile, the FCI at filling 2/3 in the AVE scheme remains more robust under similar band mixing until being suppressed when increasing band mixing. To tackle truncation errors that arise from including multiple bands in larger system sizes, we propose an ED iteration method that iteratively optimizes the single-particle basis so that the particles in the ground state should reside mainly in the lowest band. Nevertheless, we find that the FCI gap remains absent after convergence when the mixing with higher bands is considered. These findings highlight the delicate sensitivity of FCIs to multi-band effects and the shortcoming of all of the current models to explain the experimental emergence of such phases.</description>

      <title>Confluent supersymmetric algorithm for bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External magnetic field profiles leading to equidistant and partially equidistant bilayer graphene spectra within the tight-binding model are obtained. This is achieved by implementing the integral and differential versions of the second-order confluent algorithm to the harmonic oscillator for arbitrary real factorization energies. Additionally, new Barut-Girardello and Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states for bilayer graphene are derived, for both diagonal and non-diagonal ladder operators. Their time evolution is analyzed, finding temporal stability and cyclic evolution in some cases. This fact is contrasted with the non-cyclic evolution of bilayer graphene coherent states obtained when using two different factorization energies. Likewise, the geometric phase and uncertainty product of the quadratures for the previously obtained coherent states are studied.</description>

      <title>Anyonization of bosons in one dimension: an effective swap model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyons emerge as elementary excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems and exhibit behavior distinct from bosons or fermions. Previous models of anyons in one dimension (1D) are mainly categorized into two types: those that rely on nontrivial scattering behavior, and those based on density-dependent hopping processes in discrete lattices. Here, we introduce a novel framework for realizing anyonic correlations using the internal degrees of freedom of a spinor quantum gas. We propose a "swap" model, which assigns a complex phase factor to the swapping processes between two different species, referred to as "host particles" and "impurities". The anyonic characteristics are demonstrated through the one-body correlator of the impurity, using a spin-charge separation analysis. For a single impurity, our swap model can be effectively implemented by applying tilt potentials in a strongly interacting quantum gas [Dhar et al., arXiv:2412.21131]. We further explore the dynamical properties of anyonic correlations and extend our analysis to the case of multiple impurities. Our work provides new avenues for engineering many-body anyonic behavior in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Topological Aspects of Quadrupoles of Disclinations: Conformal Metrics and Self-Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric and physical effects of quadrupolar configurations of disclinations using a conformal metric approach in $(2+1)$ dimensions. Two cases are considered: a linear quadrupole, inducing anisotropic curvature with a $\cos(2\theta)$ as profile, and a square quadrupole, yielding a more isotropic field with higher angular harmonics. We solve the Poisson equation for the conformal factor and compute the corresponding Green functions. Using these configurations, we evaluated the electrostatic and magnetostatic self-energies and self-forces for linear sources. The results reveal how symmetry and curvature influence self-interaction effects, with the magnetostatic self-force exhibiting a sign reversal compared to the electrostatic case. Connections with previous models of dislocations and cosmic strings are discussed, with potential applications in graphene, nematics, and gravitational analogs.</description>

      <title>Surface Structure and Surface State of a Tight-Binding Model on a Diamond Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface states of a tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on a diamond lattice of finite thickness are investigated. We consider systems with (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Even if the surface direction is fixed, there is freedom to choose the surface structure due to the two-sublattice nature of a diamond lattice. The existence of surface states is governed by the topology of the matrix elements of the bulk Hamiltonian. In this sense, the existence of surface states is determined by the bulk Hamiltonian. However, the matrix elements depend on the choice of the unit cell, which should be chosen to conform to the surface structure. Thus, the surface states depend on the surface structure. We find that for each surface direction, there are two choices of surface structure, and depending on the chosen structure, the corresponding surface states emerge in distinct regions of the surface Brillouin zone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer fullerene (C$_{60}$) networks combine molecular-level rigidity with crystalline connectivity, offering a promising platform for numerous applications. In this Feature article, we review the physical and chemical properties of fullerene monolayers, focusing on first-principles studies. We first explore the structural stability of monolayer phases and investigate their thermal expansion behaviours. We then outline criteria for photocatalytic water splitting and introduce theoretical predictions which are supported by recent experimental verification. Finally, we show how interlayer stacking, molecular size, and dimensional tuning (from 2D monolayers into 3D crystals, 1D chains, or nanoribbons) offer versatile approaches to modulate their chemical functionality. Together, these insights establish fullerene networks as a novel class of carbon-based materials with tailored properties for catalysis, photovoltaics, and flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect Induced Anomalous Dynamics from Charge-Fluctuating Initial States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant interest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous phenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy and Gradient-Induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction on the Formation of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological spin textures (e.g. skyrmions) can be stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the magnetic multilayer, which has been intensively studied. Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by composition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt single layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered CoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition and the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The stability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and g-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic study on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient polarity and effective gradient strength (defined as gradient/thickness) in g-CoPt single layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), bulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin light scattering confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI depend on the polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt films. MFM reveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film thickness, gradient polarity, and applied magnetic field. An increased skyrmion density is observed in samples exhibiting higher magnetic anisotropy, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations and energy barrier calculations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Intrinsic and LED Light-Enhanced Memristor Performance in In-Plane Ferroelectric NbOI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) layered ferroelectrics, as an emerging area of research, have attracted extensive attention, while memristors based on new 2D ferroelectric materials have yet to be fully explored, thereby limiting their applications in modern nanoelectronics. In this work, we report the observation of intrinsic memristive behavior in a newly discovered 2D in-plane ferroelectric material, NbOI2, and the giant enhancement of the memristive performance using LED visible light. The results show that NbOI2 exhibits intrinsically strong memristive response with a current on/off ratio of up to 10^4 and stable switching cycles, which is independent of back-gate voltage. Under LED visible light illumination, the current on/off ratio in NbOI2 is over one order of magnitude higher than that without light, meanwhile, the coercive field is significantly reduced to less than 1.22 kVcm-1, much lower than other 2D ferroelectric material-based memristors. Interestingly, both the intrinsic and the light-enhanced resistive switching phenomena only occur along the in-plane b-axis direction, indicating that the memristive behavior in NbOI2 is driven by electric field-induced and optical field-enhanced ferroelectric polarization switching mechanisms, as evidenced by a combined orientation-dependent electrical/optoelectrical measurement and sweep cycle-induced structural evolution analysis. Our study not only provides a materials strategy based on new 2D ferroelectrics for designing memristor applications, but also offers a simple optical method to enhance its performance, paving the path for its implementation in novel nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Hidden vibrational bistability revealed by intrinsic fluctuations of a carbon nanotube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quiet state and large-amplitude self-sustained oscillations can co-exist in a carbon nanotube subject to time-independent drive. A feature of the bistability is that it would be hysteresis-free in the absence of noise and the oscillatory state would not be seen. It is revealed by random switching between the stable states, which we observe in the time domain. We attribute the switching to fluctuations in the system and show that it displays Poisson statistics. We propose a minimalistic model that relates the emergence of the bistability to a non-monotonic variation of nonlinear friction with the vibration amplitude. This new type of dynamical regime and the means to reveal it are generic and are of interest for various mesoscopic vibrational systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of spin configurations and magnetoresistance in van der Waals magnetic semiconductors, particularly in the realm of thin-layer structures, is of paramount significance for the development of two-dimensional spintronic nanodevices. In this letter, we present detailed magneto-transport and photoluminescence studies on few-layer CrSBr flakes utilizing a vertical tunneling device configuration. Our investigations revealed complex magnetic states along the evolutionary path of few-layer CrSBr. We observed intermediate states exhibiting identical net magnetization demonstrate rectification properties, reminiscent of a diode-like behavior at positive and negative bias voltages. Notably, in devices with 5-layer CrSBr, we detected an intriguing positive magnetoresistive state when subjected to an in-plane magnetic field along the b-axis. The implementation of the Mott two-current model successfully calculated the tunneling resistance of different magnetic states, thereby elucidating the spin configurations responsible for the observed transport phenomena. These insights not only provide new perspectives on the intricate spin textures of two-dimensional CrSBr but also highlight the efficacy of tunneling measurements as a sensitive method for probing magnetic order in van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Terahertz Resonances from Ballistic Electron Funnelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism for second-harmonic generation through geometrically rectifying-funneling-ballistic electrons in THz optical resonators. Our resonant rectifiers inherently act as second-order harmonic generators, rectifying currents without the presence of a potential barrier. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that femtosecond electron-surface scattering plays a critical role in this process. We differentiate electron funneling from nonlocal plasmonic drag and bulk Dirac anharmonicity, showing that funneling can reduce the required field intensity for second-harmonic generation by 3-4 orders of magnitude. We provide design guidelines for generating funneling-induced second-harmonic generation, including resonance mode matching and materials selection. This approach offers a practical pathway for low-field, geometrically tunable THz upconversion and rectification, operating from sub-10 THz to multiple tens of THz in graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6{\AA} to 27.2{\AA} after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum scars have recently been directly visualized in graphene quantum dots (Nature 635, 841 (2024)), revealing their resilience and influence on electron dynamics in mesoscopic systems. Here, we examine variational scarring in two-dimensional quantum dots and demonstrate that these states remain robust even in an open system. We show that controlled perturbations enable modulation of electronic transmission via scarred states, presenting a viable approach to tuning quantum transport. These findings provide insights into the role of scarring in mesoscopic transport and open pathways for experimental realization in quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodal planes, two-dimensional symmetry-enforced band crossings, can carry a topological charge, similar to Weyl points. While the transport properties of Weyl points are well understood, those of nodal planes remain largely unexplored. These properties are influenced not only by the Berry curvature, but also by other quantum geometric quantities. In this work we study the quantum geometry - specifically the Berry curvature and quantum metric - and the linear optical conductivity of topological nodal planes. We introduce a low-energy model and investigate its low-frequency optical responses to determine the unique signatures of topological nodal planes. By comparing these findings to the optical response in a tight-binding model with a topological nodal plane, we observe consistent low-frequency behavior with a cubic power law. This paves the way for the experimental detection of topological nodal planes through optical conductivity measurements.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry. Resonant microwave excitation of the Rydberg transition induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance originating from adiabatic state transitions and the finite curvature of the energy bands. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.34~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ for our RF reflectometry scheme. This sensitivity is sufficient to detect the Rydberg transition of a single electron, offering a scalable pathway toward qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical applications of plasmonic nanoparticle conjugates need control over their optical properties modulated by surface coating with stabilizing or targeting molecules often attached to or embedded in the secondary functionalization shell, such as silica. Although current numerical techniques can simulate the plasmonic response of such structures, it is desirable in practice to have analytical models based on simple physical ideas that can be implemented without considerable computer resources. Here, we present two efficient analytical methods based on improved electrostatic approximation (IEA) and modal expansion method (MEM) combined with the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The last approach avoids additional electromagnetic simulations and provides a direct bridge between analytical IEA and MEM models for bare particles and those with multilayer shells. As simple as the original IEA and MEM, the developed analytical extensions provide accurate extinction and scattering spectra for coated particles compared to exact calculations by separation of variable method and COMSOL. The possibility and accuracy of analytical models are illustrated by extensive simulations for prolate and oblate gold and silver nanoparticles with a maximal size of up to 200 nm, aspect ratio from 2 to 6, and 3-30 nm dielectric coating.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Spin Metrology with Nitrogen Vacancy Center in Diamond for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>

Abstract: We present a method to directly detect the axion dark matter using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. In particular, we use metrology leveraging the nuclear spin of nitrogen to detect axion-nucleus couplings. This is achieved through protocols designed for dark matter searches, which introduce a novel approach of quantum sensing techniques based on the nitrogen vacancy center. Although the coupling strength of the magnetic fields with nuclear spins is three orders of magnitude smaller than that with electron spins for conventional magnetometry, the axion interaction strength with nuclear spins is the same order of magnitude as that with electron spins. Furthermore, we can take advantage of the long coherence time by using the nuclear spins for the axion dark matter detection. We show that our method is sensitive to a broad frequency range $\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ corresponding to the axion mass $m_a \lesssim 4\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We present the detection limit of our method for both the axion-neutron and the axion-proton couplings and discuss its significance in comparison with other proposed ideas.</description>

      <title>Enhancing light emission with electric fields in polar nitride semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant effort has been devoted to mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as these fields are traditionally viewed as detrimental to light emission, particularly for red emission. Contrary to this prevailing notion, we demonstrate that strong polarization fields can enhance the optical-transition strength of AlInGaN quantum wells emitting in the red, which has been historically challenging to achieve. By leveraging machine-learning surrogate models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, we globally explore the heterostructure design space and uncover that larger fields correlate with higher electron-hole overlap. This relation arises from the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables thinner wells without requiring higher indium compositions, thus overcoming a key limitation in nitride epitaxy. Structural and compositional engineering of internal fields offers a unique dimension for designing polychromatic nitride LEDs, crucial for miniaturizing LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. Broadly, our work demonstrates how machine learning can uncover unexpected paradigms for semiconductor design.</description>

      <title>Electron-mediated anharmonicity and its role in the Raman spectrum of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Raman active G mode in graphene exhibits strong coupling to electrons, yet the comprehensive treatment of this interaction in the calculation of its temperature-dependent Raman spectrum remains incomplete. In this study, we calculate the temperature dependence of the G mode frequency and linewidth, and successfully explain the experimental trend, by accounting for the contributions arising from the first-order electron-phonon coupling, electron-mediated phonon-phonon coupling, and standard lattice anharmonicity. The generality of our approach enables its broad applicability to study phonon dynamics in materials where both electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are important.</description>

      <title>Slow, Nanometer Light Confinement Observed in Atomically Thin TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07572</link>

Abstract: Extreme light confinement down to the atomic scale has been theoretically predicted for ultrathin, Ta-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this work, we experimentally demonstrate in 2H-TaS$_2$ monolayers and bilayers a lateral confinement ratio up to 300 at large wave vectors of $q = 0.15 \, \r{A}^{-1}$, and slow light behaviour with a group velocity $\sim 10^{-4}c$. Quantitative momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (q-EELS) with a momentum resolution of $0.0056 \, \r{A}^{-1}$ was used as a platform for the nanoscale optical measurements. With it, momentum-dispersed, two-dimensional (2D) plasmon resonances were experimentally observed, showing a transition from 2D to 3D Coulomb interaction in the high-momentum regime, equivalent to light confinement volumes of $1\text{-}2 \, \text{nm}^3$. Remarkably, the resonant modes do not enter the electron-hole continuum, predicting even further enhanced optical field confinements for this material at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a nontrivial generalization of the mechanism in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. We particularly reach two novel models, with one hosting all basic types of mobility edges and the other hosting all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

      <title>Coupled-wire Construction of a Non-crystalline Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, has been realised in two-dimensional strongly correlated quantum gases and Chern bands of crystals. Here we construct a non-crystalline analogue by coupling quantum wires that are not periodically placed in real-space. Remarkably, the model remains solvable using bosonisation techniques. Due to the non-uniform couplings between the wires, the ground state has different degeneracy compared to the crystalline case. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), anyons confined to hop between two wires (s-lineons), and anyonic excitations that are free to travel across the system. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires. By providing an analytically solvable model of a non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effect, our work showcases that topological order can display richer phenomenology beyond crystals. More broadly, the non-uniform wire construction we develop can serve as a tool to explore richer many-body phenomenology in non-crystalline systems.</description>
