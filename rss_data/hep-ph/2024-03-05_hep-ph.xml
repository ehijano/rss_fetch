      <title>Collective excitations and low-energy ionization signatures of relativistic particles in silicon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state detectors with a low energy threshold have several applications, including in direct-detection searches of non-relativistic halo dark-matter particles with sub-GeV masses. Moreover, when searching for relativistic or quasi-relativistic beyond-the-Standard-Model particles (i.e., $v/c\gtrsim 0.01$) that have an enhanced cross section for small energy transfers, a comparatively small detector with a low energy threshold may have better sensitivity than a larger detector with a higher energy threshold. In this paper, we provide accurate calculations of the low-energy ionization spectrum from high-velocity particles scattering in a dielectric material. We focus on silicon, although our results can be easily applied to other materials. We consider the full material response, in particular also the excitation of bulk plasmons. We generalize the energy-loss function to relativistic kinematics, and benchmark existing tools used for halo dark-matter scattering against publicly available electron energy-loss spectroscopy data. Compared to calculations of energy loss that are commonly used in the literature, such as the Photo-Absorption-Ionization model or the free-electron model, the inclusion of collective effects shifts the recoil ionization spectrum towards higher energies, typically peaking around 4--6 electron-hole pairs. We apply our results to the three benchmark examples: millicharged particles produced in a beam, neutrinos with a magnetic dipole moment produced in a reactor, and dark-matter particles that are upscattered by cosmic rays or in the Sun. Our results show that the proper inclusion of collective effects typically enhances a detector's sensitivity to these particles, since detector backgrounds, such as dark counts, peak at lower energies.</description>

      <title>Pole properties of a resonance: When to subtract partial-decay widths to obtain the pole widths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a resonance lies near the threshold of a heavier channel, an interesting feature can occur. The paradigmatic example employed here is the scalar isoscalar $f_0(980)$ resonance that couples to the lighter $\pi\pi$ and heavier $K\bar{K}$ channels. It is shown that the decay width is given by the sum or subtraction of the partial decay widths depending on whether the pole lies in the Riemann sheet that is contiguous with the physical one above or below the $K\bar{K}$ threshold, respectively. Next, we show that the usually disregarded renormalization of bare parameters in Flatt\'e or energy-dependent Breit-Wigner parameterizations is essential to extract physical information. The compositeness of the $f_0(980)$ by using a Flatt\'e parameterization matched to reproduce the pole properties obtained from Roy equations and other analytic constraints is evaluated.</description>

      <title>A Phenomenological Study of WIMP Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate various possibilities of Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) and their implications. These possibilities are important because they challenge the viability of WIMP DM in light of tight constraints from experiments such as direct detection. We begin by analyzing a fermion dark matter possibility with an axion-like particle (ALP) portal. We consider theoretical and experimental limits related to neutrino and ALP data within a certain mass range, and we find the allowed parameter space. This possibility resolves the problem of the lack of direct detection of WIMP DM through the ALP portal. Furthermore, we examine the limits on photon signals from HESS and Fermi-LAT data. Next, we look at a two-component scalar and fermion dark matter possibility, following a similar approach to our previous work. This simple possibility requires only a few additional fields and symmetries to explain neutrino mass and dark matter candidates. By finding parameter space that satisfies various bounds, such as relic density, direct detection, and invisible Higgs width, we show that both scalar and fermion particles can serve as DM. This possibility is consistent and offers a rich spectrum of phenomenology that can be tested through collider-based experiments. In our final work, we removie the extra Z2 symmetry and added a new pseudoscalar particle in our two compoent model. We test this pseudoscalar particle against multiple DM and non-DM related bounds, including DM lifetime bound, Planck bound, direct-detection limits from various target materials, and invisible Higgs width. The possibility exhibits a significant parameter space for our pseudoscalar DM while being in agreement with theoretical and experimental limits.</description>

      <title>Dual symmetries of dense three and two-color QCD and some QCD-like NJL models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the symmetry properties of the phase diagram of dense quark matter composed of $u$ and $d$ quarks with two or three colors has been investigated in the framework of massless (3+1)-dimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) and QCD models. It turns out that in the presence of baryon $\mu_B$, isospin $\mu_I$, chiral $\mu_5$ and chiral isospin $\mu_{I5}$ chemical potentials the Lagrangians of these models are invariant under the so-called dual transformations. Consequently, the entire NJL model (or QCD) thermodynamic potentials are dually symmetric. In particular, it means that in the total $(\mu_B,\mu_I,\mu_5,\mu_{I5})$-phase portraits of these models the chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) and charged pion condensation (PC) phases are arranged dually conjugated (or symmetrical) to each other (in the case of three-color models). Whereas in the case of two-color quark matter, these models predict the entire phase structure in which there are dual symmetries between CSB, charged PC and baryon superfluid phases.</description>

      <title>Charge-conjugation asymmetry and molecular content: the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ in matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the modifications that a dense nuclear medium induces in the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ and $D_{s1}(2460)^\pm$. In the vacuum, we consider them as isoscalar $D^{(*)}K$ and $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ $S$-wave bound states, which are dynamically generated from effective interactions that lead to different Weinberg compositeness scenarios. Matter effects are incorporated through the two-meson loop functions, taking into account the self energies that the $D^{(*)}$, $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}$, $K$, and $\overline{K}$ develop when embedded in a nuclear medium. Although particle-antiparticle [$D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^+$ versus $D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^-$] lineshapes are the same in vacuum, we find extremely different density patterns in matter. This charge-conjugation asymmetry mainly stems from the very different kaon and antikaon interaction with the nucleons of the dense medium. We show that the in-medium lineshapes found for these resonances strongly depend on their $D^{(*)}K$/$\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ molecular content, and discuss how this novel feature can be used to better determine/constrain the inner structure of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Testing the presence of QGP in small systems using (multi-)strange hadron correlations with a $\phi$ meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study delves into the enhanced production of strange and multi-strange hadrons in proton-proton collisions at LHC. Novel observables are proposed to distinguish between models describing existing data with or without the assumption of a QGP. Two models are explored: EPOS4, based on core-corona separation between a QGP phase and a vacuum phase, and PYTHIA 8.3, based on microscopic interactions between Lund strings. The observables are based on an event selection requiring the presence of a $\phi$ meson. Correlations between the $\phi$ and (multi-)strange hadrons are shown to be an excellent discriminator between the two types of models. These observations emphasize the need for further testing in upcoming LHC Runs, leveraging improved detectors and increased data collection.</description>

      <title>The non-first-order-factorizable contributions to the three-loop single-mass operator matrix elements $A_{Qg}^{(3)}$ and $\Delta A_{Qg}^{(3)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-first-order-factorizable contributions (The terms 'first-order-factorizable contributions' and 'non-first-order-factorizable contributions' have been introduced and discussed in Refs. \cite{Behring:2023rlq,Ablinger:2023ahe}. They describe the factorization behaviour of the difference- or differential equations for a subset of master integrals of a given problem.) to the unpolarized and polarized massive operator matrix elements to three-loop order, $A_{Qg}^{(3)}$ and $\Delta A_{Qg}^{(3)}$, are calculated in the single-mass case. For the $_2F_1$-related master integrals of the problem, we use a semi-analytic method based on series expansions and utilize the first-order differential equations for the master integrals which does not need a special basis of the master integrals. Due to the singularity structure of this basis a part of the integrals has to be computed to $O(\varepsilon^5)$ in the dimensional parameter. The solutions have to be matched at a series of thresholds and pseudo-thresholds in the region of the Bjorken variable $x \in ]0,\infty[$ using highly precise series expansions to obtain the imaginary part of the physical amplitude for $x \in ]0,1]$ at a high relative accuracy. We compare the present results both with previous analytic results, the results for fixed Mellin moments, and a prediction in the small-$x$ region. We also derive expansions in the region of small and large values of $x$. With this paper, all three-loop single-mass unpolarized and polarized operator matrix elements are calculated.</description>

      <title>A new Wolfenstein-like expansion of lepton flavor mixing towards understanding its fine structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking the tri-bimaximal flavor mixing pattern as a particular basis, we propose a new way to expand the $3\times 3$ unitary Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$ in powers of the magnitude of its smallest element $\xi \equiv \left|U^{}_{e 3}\right| \simeq 0.149$. Such a Wolfenstein-like parametrization of $U$ allows us to easily describe the salient features and fine structures of flavor mixing and CP violation, both in vacuum and in matter.</description>

      <title>Neutrino phenomenology in the modular $S_3$ seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied neutrino phenomenology in the supersymmetric type-I seesaw model endowed with the $\Gamma_2 \simeq S_3$ modular symmetry. We have identified different realizations of the $S_3$ modular symmetry, referred to as models A, B, C, and D. The 4 models are compatible with neutrino mass being inverted ordering (IO). Moreover, models A, B, and D can also accommodate normal ordering (NO) neutrino masses. We identify parameter space for each model compatible with neutrino oscillation at the 2-$\sigma$ level. We then proceed to study the neutrino phenomenology of each model. We find that the lightest neutrino mass can be as light as 0.64 meV in the case of NO in model A and 50 meV in the case of IO in model D. The smallest effective electron neutrino mass attainable in our analysis is 8.8 meV in the case of NO (model A), and 50 meV for IO (model D). Finally, we note that the effective Majorana mass can be as small as 0.33 meV in the case of NO (model A) and 22 meV for IO (model D).</description>

      <title>A Light-Front Model for the Transition Distribution Amplitudes for Backward Timelike Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To access information on the internal structure of the nucleon, data from a variety of scattering experiments can be analyzed, in regimes where the information factorizes from an otherwise known scattering amplitude. A recent development, promising new insight, is the study of exclusive reactions in the backward kinematical region, where the information can be encoded in Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDAs). We model the photon-to-nucleon TDAs, entering the factorized description of backward Timelike Compton Scattering, using techniques of light-front dynamics to integrate information from a quark model for the photon and the nucleon. We include the results of numerical predictions that could inform further experiments at Jefferson Lab and the future Electron--Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical solution of relativistic hydrodynamics for a system having cylindrical symmetry with boost-invariant longitudinal expansion and Hubble-like transverse expansion. We also consider analytical solution for Hubble-like spherically expanding system. For these two cases, we calculate analytical expression for transverse momentum spectra of hadrons, at constant temperature freeze-out hypersurface using Cooper-Frye prescription. We compare our results for transverse momentum spectra with experimental results from Large Hadron Collider and CERN SPS where one expects cylindrical and spherical geometry of the fireball, respectively. In the case of low-energy collisions with spherical geometry, we calculate rapidity spectra and compare with the results from CERN SPS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its role in the continuing evolution of the Universe, only a small fraction of the mass of visible material can be attributed to the Higgs boson alone. The overwhelmingly dominant share may/should arise from the strong interactions that act in the heart of nuclear matter; namely, those described by quantum chromodynamics. This contribution describes how studying and explaining the attributes of pseudoscalar mesons can open an insightful window onto understanding the origin of mass in the Standard Model and how these insights inform our knowledge of hadron structure. The survey ranges over distribution amplitudes and functions, electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, light-front wave functions, and generalized parton distributions. Advances made using continuum Schwinger function methods and their relevance for experimental efforts are highlighted.</description>

      <title>J/psi-pair production at NLL in TMD factorisation at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J/psi-pair production at the LHC is currently one of the few tools available to probe gluon transverse momentum distributions (TMDs). In this context, data from LHCb in the collider mode have the potential to probe the evolution of the unpolarised-gluon TMDs and to measure the distribution of the linearly-polarised gluon in unpolarised protons for the first time. In this proceedings contribution, improved predictions obtained for the LHC (at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV) up to next-to-leading logarithm (NLL) in TMD factorisation are presented. We show the obtained predictions of transverse-momentum distributions at different invariant masses and rapidities computed in the LHCb acceptance along with PDF uncertainty. We predict the azimuthal modulations of the cross section that arise from linearly-polarised gluons.</description>

      <title>Mass Beyond Measure: Eccentric Searches for Black Hole Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar mass binary black holes of unknown formation mechanism have been observed, motivating new methods for distinguishing distinct black hole populations. This work explores how the orbital eccentricity of stellar mass binary black holes is a viable conduit for making such distinctions. Four different production mechanisms, and their corresponding eccentricity distributions, are studied in the context of an experimental landscape composed of mHz (LISA), dHz (DECIGO), and Hz (LIGO) range gravitational wave detectors. We expand on prior work considering these effects at fixed population eccentricity. We show that a strong signal corresponding to subsets of eccentric populations is effectively hidden from the mHz and dHz range gravitational wave detectors without the incorporation of high eccentricity waveform templates. Even with sufficiently large eccentricity templates, we find dHz range experiments with a LISA-like level of sensitivity are unlikely to aid in distinguishing different populations. We consider the degree to which a mHz range detector like LISA can differentiate among black hole populations independently and in concert with follow-up merger detection for binaries coalescing within a 10 year period. We find that mHz range detectors, with only $e &lt; 0.01$ (nearly circular) sensitivity, can successfully discern eccentric sub-populations except when attempting to distinguish very low eccentricity distributions. In these cases where $e &lt; 0.01$ sensitivity is insufficient, we find that the increase in event counts resulting from $e &lt; 0.1$ sensitivity provides a statistically significant signal for discerning even these low eccentricity sub-populations. While improvements offered by $e&lt;0.1$ sensitivity can be generally increased by $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factors with $e&lt;0.4$ sensitivity, going beyond this in eccentricity sensitivity provides negligible enhancement.</description>

      <title>Sudden breakdown of effective field theory near cool Kerr-Newman black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that (near-)extremal Kerr black holes are sensitive probes of small higher-derivative corrections to general relativity. In particular, these corrections produce diverging tidal forces on the horizon in the extremal limit. We show that adding a black hole charge makes this effect qualitatively stronger. Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Newman solution produce tidal forces that scale inversely in the black hole temperature. We find that, unlike the Kerr case, for realistic values of the black hole charge large tidal forces can arise before quantum corrections due to the Schwarzian mode become important, so that the near-horizon behavior of the black hole is dictated by higher-derivative terms in the effective theory.</description>

Abstract: A possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension, has been investigated. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>The Odd 2D Bubbles, 4D Triangles, and Einstein and Weyl Anomalies in 2D Gravitational Fermionic amplitudes: The Role of Breaking Integration Linearity for Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated Relations Among Green Functions defined in an alternative strategy for coping with the divergences, also called the Implicit Regularization Method (IREG): the mathematical content (divergent and finite) will remain intact until the calculations end. The divergent part will be organized through standardized objects free of physical quantities. In contrast, the finite part is projected in a class of well-behaved functions that carry all the amplitudes' physical content. That relations arise in fermionic amplitudes in even space-time dimensions, where anomalous tensors connect to finite amplitudes as in the bubbles and triangles in two and four dimensions. Those tensors depend on surface terms, whose non-zero values arise from finite amplitudes as requirements of consistency with the linearity of integration and uniqueness. Maintaining these terms implies breaking momentum-space homogeneity and, in a later step, the Ward identities. Meanwhile, eliminating them allows more than one mathematical expression for the same amplitude. That is a consequence of choices related to the involved Dirac traces. Independently of divergences, it is impossible to satisfy all symmetry implications by simultaneously requiring vanishing surface terms and linearity. Then we approach the 1-loop level fermionic correction for the propagation of the graviton in a space-time D=1+1 through the action of a Weyl fermion in curved space-time. In this context, gravitational anomalies arise, and the amplitudes investigated have the highest degree of divergence quadratic. That imposes a substantial algebraic effort; however, the conclusions are in agreement with the non-gravitational amplitudes. At the end of the calculations, we show how it is possible to fix the value of the divergent part through the relations imposed for amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Angular bispectrum and trispectrum of scalar-induced gravitational-waves: all contributions from primordial non-Gaussianity $\fnl$ and $\gnl$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the primordial non-Gaussianity of inflationary perturbations is crucial for testing the inflation paradigm of the early universe. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the presence of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity parameterized by $\fnl$ and $\gnl$, deriving their semi-analytical formulae for the first time. Our findings indicate that it is the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity that leads to a non-Gaussian SIGW background, suggesting that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of SIGWs could serve as probes of the primordial non-Gaussianity. Our numerical results further illustrate that $\fnl$ and $\gnl$ exert significant impacts on the spectral amplitudes, potentially reaching up to $10^{-5}$ for the former and $10^{-8}$ for the latter. In particular, we demonstrate that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum exhibit characteristic dependence on the angular multipoles and frequency bands. They hold potentials to be measured by gravitational-wave detectors that may advance our understanding of the origin of the universe.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in a cyclic Universe: resilience through cycles and vacuum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalised calculation for the spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations in a cyclic Universe, making no assumptions about the vacuum state of the theory and accounting for the contribution of tensor modes produced in the dark energy phase of the previous cycle. We show that these modes have minimal impact on the spectrum observed in the current cycle, except for corrections on scales as large as the comoving Hubble radius today. These corrections are due to sub-horizon modes produced towards the end of the dark energy phase, persisting into the ekpyrotic phase of the next cycle as additional quanta. In relation to the vacuum state, we argue that non-Bunch-Davies quanta can easily overwhelm the energy density driving the dark energy phase, potentially compromising the model. Therefore, avoiding backreaction effects sets restrictive constraints on deviations away from the Bunch-Davies vacuum during this phase, limiting the overall freedom to consider alternative vacua in the cyclic Universe.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Collins-Soper Kernel from Chiral Quarks with Physical Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the rapidity anomalous dimension of quark transverse-momentum-dependent distributions, i.e., the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, up to transverse separations of about 1 fm. This unitary lattice calculation is conducted, for the first time, employing the chiral-symmetry-preserving domain wall fermion discretization and physical values of light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is extracted from the ratios of pion quasi-transverse-momentum-dependent wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic perturbative accuracy. Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line. We observe significantly slower signal decay with increasing quark separations compared to the established gauge-invariant method with a staple-shaped Wilson line. This enables us to determine the CS kernel at large nonperturbative transverse separations and find its near-linear dependence on the latter. Our result is consistent with the recent lattice calculation using gauge-invariant quasi-TMDWFs, and agrees with various recent phenomenological parametrizations of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Numerical challenges for energy conservation in N-body simulations of collapsing self-interacting dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) haloes can be subject to gravothermal collapse if DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions. When the scattering can efficiently transfer heat from the centre to the outskirts, the central region of the halo collapses and reaches densities much higher than those for collisionless DM. This phenomenon is potentially observable in studies of strong lensing. Current theoretical efforts are motivated by observations of surprisingly dense substructures. A comparison with them requires accurate predictions. One method to obtain such predictions is to use N-body simulations. The collapsed haloes are extreme systems that pose severe challenges to state-of-the-art codes used to model self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We investigate the root of such problems with a focus on energy non-conservation. We run N-body simulations with and without DM self-interactions of an isolated DM-only halo and change numerical parameters relevant to the accuracy of the simulation. We find that not only the numerical scheme for the DM self-interactions can lead to energy non-conservation but also the modelling of gravitational interaction and the time integration are problematic. The issues we found are: (a) particles changing their time step in a non-time-reversible manner; (b) the asymmetry in the tree-based gravitational force evaluation; (c) SIDM velocity kicks break the symplectic nature and time symmetry. Tuning the parameters of the simulation to achieve a high accuracy allows for conserving energy not only at early stages of the evolution but also at late ones. However, the cost of the simulations becomes prohibitively large. Some problems making the simulations of the gravothermal collapse phase inaccurate, can be overcome by choosing appropriate numerical schemes. However, others remain challenging. Our findings motivate further work on addressing these challenges.</description>

      <title>The QCD theta-parameter in canonical quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of the QCD theta-parameter is investigated in pure Yang-Mills theory in the spacetime given by the four-dimensional Euclidean torus. While in this setting the introduction of possibly unphysical boundary conditions is avoided, it must be specified how the sum over the topological sectors is to be carried out. To connect with observables in real time, we perceive the partition function as the trace over the canonical density matrix. The system then corresponds to one of a finite temperature on a spatial three-torus. Carrying out the trace operation requires canonical quantization and gauge fixing. Fixing the gauge and demanding that the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian is maintained leads to a restriction of the Hilbert space of physical wave functionals that generalizes the constraints derived from imposing Gauss' law. Consequently, we find that the states in the Hilbert space are properly normalizable under an inner product that integrates over each physical configuration represented by the gauge potential one time and one time only. The observables derived from the constrained Hilbert space do not violate charge-parity symmetry. We note that an exact hidden symmetry of the theory that is present for arbitrary values of theta in the Hamiltonian is effectively promoted to parity conservation in this constrained space. These results, derived on a torus in order to avoid the introduction of boundary conditions, also carry over to Minkowski spacetime when taking account of all possible gauge transformations.</description>

Abstract: In the simplest little Higgs model the new flavor-changing interactions between heavy neutrinos and the Standard Model leptons can generate contributions to some lepton flavor violating decays of $Z$-boson at one-loop level, such as $Z \to \tau^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}$, $Z\to \tau^{\pm}e^{\mp}$, and $Z \to \mu^{\pm}e^{\mp}$. We examine the decay modes, and find that the branching ratios can reach $10^{-7}$ for the three decays, which should be accessible at the Giga$Z$ option of the ILC.</description>

Abstract: In light of the recent LHC Higgs data, we examine the parameter space of type II two-Higgs-doublet model in which the 125 GeV Higgs has the wrong sign Yukawa couplings. Combining related theoretical and experimental limits, we find that the LHC Higgs data exclude most of the parameter space of the wrong sign Yukawa coupling. For $m_H=$ 600 GeV, the allowed samples are mainly distributed in several corners and narrow bands of m_A&lt;20 GeV, 30 GeV&lt;m_A&lt;120 GeV, 240 GeV&lt;m_A&lt;300 GeV, 380 GeV &lt;m_A&lt;430 GeV, and 480 GeV&lt;m_A&lt;550 GeV. For m_A=600 GeV, m_H is required to be less than 470 GeV. The light pseudo-scalar with a mass of 20 GeV is still allowed in case of the wrong sign Yukawa coupling of 125 GeV Higgs.</description>

      <title>Right-handed neutrino pair production via second-generation leptoquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: No direct experimental constraints exist on Leptoquark (LQ) couplings with quarks and right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). If a LQ dominantly couples to RHNs, it can leave unique signatures at the LHC. The RHNs can be produced copiously from LQ decays as long as they are lighter than the LQs. LQ-induced RHN production has never been searched for in experiments. This channel can act as a simultaneous probe for RHNs and LQs that dominantly couple to RHNs. In this paper, we consider all possible charge-$2/3$ and $1/3$ scalar and vector LQs that dominantly couple to second-generation quarks and RHN. We study the pair and single productions of TeV-scale LQs and their subsequent decay to sub-TeV RHNs, realised in the inverse seesaw framework. We also consider RHN pair production through a $t$-channel LQ exchange. The single LQ production and $t$-channel contributions can be significant for large LQ-RHN-quark couplings. We systematically combine events from these processes leading to a pair of RHNs plus jets to study the prospects of LQ-assisted RHN pair production. We analyse the monolepton and opposite-sign dilepton final states and estimate the discovery reach at the high-luminosity LHC.</description>

Abstract: Recently LHCb experimental group find an exotic state $T^+_{cc}$ from the process $p\bar{p} \to D^0D^0\pi^+ + X$. A key question is if it is just a molecule or may have confined tetraquark ingredient. To investigate this, different methods are taken, including two channel ($D^{*+}D^0$ and $D^{*0}D^+$) K-matrix unitarization and single channel Flatt\'e-like parametrization method analysed by pole counting rule and spectral density function sum rule. It demonstrates that $T^+_{cc}$ is a molecular state, though the possibility that there may exist elementary ingredient can not be excluded, by rough analysis on its production rate.</description>

      <title>On the criterion of perturbativity with the mass-dependent beta function in extended Higgs models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to realize electroweak first order phase transition, a category of extended Higgs models with relatively large self-coupling constants is often considered. In such a scenario, the running coupling constants can blow up at an energy scale much below the Planck scale. To clarify the allowed parameter space of the model, it is important to evaluate the scale where perturbation calculation breaks down. In the renormalization group equation analysis using the mass-independent beta function, it is not clear where the matching scale is set to connect the low energy theory and the high energy theory. Consequently, the analysis is often performed by putting the matching condition artificially. On the other hand, the analysis with the mass-dependent beta function does not contain ambiguity in the matching condition, because the threshold effect is automatically included in the beta function. Therefore, in this paper, using the mass-dependent beta function at the one-loop level, we discuss the application limit of perturbation calculation. First, in a toy model with two complex scalar fields, we explain the essence of our method and compare the results based on the mass-independent beta function. We then apply our method to the more realistic model; i.e., the inert doublet model. We find that in our method in which the threshold effect is automatically included, the energy scale where the perturbation calculation breaks down can be higher than the one using the mass-independent beta function without artificial threshold correction, especially when the blow up scale is relatively low.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an effective field theory to study \emph{indirect} mixing of two fields induced by their couplings to a common decay channel in a medium. The extension of the method of Lee, Oehme and Yang, the cornerstone of analysis of CP violation in flavored mesons, to include mixing of particles with different masses provides a guide to and benchmark for the effective field theory. The analysis reveals subtle caveats in the description of mixing in terms of the widely used non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, more acute in the non-degenerate case. The effective field theory describes the dynamics of field mixing where the common intermediate states populate a bath in thermal equilibrium, as an \emph{open quantum system}. We obtain the effective action up to second order in the couplings, where indirect mixing is a consequence of off-diagonal self-energy components. We find that if only one of the mixing fields features an initial expectation value, indirect mixing induces an expectation value of the other field. The equal time two point correlation functions exhibit asymptotic approach to a stationary thermal state, and the emergence of long-lived \emph{bath induced} coherence which display quantum beats as a consequence of interference of quasinormal modes in the medium. The amplitudes of the quantum beats are resonantly enhanced in the nearly degenerate case with potential observational consequences.</description>

Abstract: Left-right symmetric models (LRSM) were proposed to reconcile the apparent parity violation in weak interactions with our intrinsic notion of fundamental parity symmetry. It was quickly realized that LRSM offers a viable framework for explaining neutrino masses by incorporating right-handed neutrinos, $N$, into its spectrum. In this study, we investigate for the first time the potential of future lepton colliders (including the FCC-ee, CEPC, ILC, CLIC, and a muon collider) to detect signals stemming from $N$'s, focusing primarily on displaced vertex signals, and on prompt signals to a lesser degree. Our results demonstrate that these signals can effectively probe the characteristic scales of LRSM, providing evidence that would be unobtainable through any other experimental means.</description>

      <title>Charmonium decays of beauty baryons in the perturbative QCD approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in experimental measurements of heavy baryon decays, the charmonium decays of single $b$-baryon are investigated systematically in the framework of perturbative QCD approach. We calculate the decay branching ratios and helicity amplitudes as well as many pertinent decay asymmetry parameters that characterize the angular decay distributions. In particular, we estimate the fragmentation fractions of $b$ quark to $b$-baryons based on the current world averages of the branching ratio multiplied by fragmentation fraction. Some of the featured results are compared with the predictions of other approaches and experimental data. We also evaluate the branching ratios and angular asymmetries of the $\Sigma_b$ and $\Xi'_b$ decay modes, which have neither been measured experimentally nor calculated theoretically. Our results could be helpful for a future experimental search for them and provide deeper insights in the understanding of the dynamics of heavy-flavor weak decay processes.</description>

      <title>Probing light quark Yukawa couplings through angularity distributions in Higgs boson decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to utilize angularity distributions in Higgs boson decay to probe light quark Yukawa couplings at $e^+e^-$ colliders. Angularities $\tau_a$ are a class of 2-jet event shapes with variable and tunable sensitivity to the distribution of radiation in hadronic jets in the final state. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we present a prediction of angularity distributions from Higgs decaying to quark and gluon states at $e^+e^-$ colliders to ${\rm NNLL}+\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ accuracy. Due to the different color structures in quark and gluon jets, the angularity distributions from $H\to q\bar{q}$ and $H\to gg$ show different behaviors and can be used to constrain the light quark Yukawa couplings. We show that the upper limit of light quark Yukawa couplings could be probed to the level of $\sim15\%$ of the bottom quark Yukawa coupling in the Standard Model in a conservative analysis window far away from nonperturbative effects and other uncertainties; the limit can be pushed to $\lesssim 7-9\%$ with better control of the nonperturbative effects especially on gluon angularity distributions and/or with multiple angularities.</description>

      <title>A unified description of DGLAP, CSS, and BFKL: TMD factorization bridging large and small x</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorization scheme designed to unify both large and small Bjorken-x regimes. We compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections to the gluon TMD operator for an unpolarized hadron within this proposed scheme. This leads to the emergence of a new TMD evolution, incorporating those in transverse momentum, rapidity, and Bjorken-x. When matched to the collinear factorization scheme, our factorization scheme faithfully reproduces the well-established Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) and Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) evolutions. Conversely, matching with high-energy factorization not only yields the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) evolution but also reveals distinctive signatures of CSS logarithms. The development of this novel TMD factorization scheme, capable of seamlessly reconciling disparate Bjorken-x regimes and faithfully reproducing established QCD evolution equations, has the potential to significantly advance our comprehension of high-energy processes and three-dimensional parton structures of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Improving the performance of weak supervision searches using transfer and meta-learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak supervision searches have in principle the advantages of both being able to train on experimental data and being able to learn distinctive signal properties. However, the practical applicability of such searches is limited by the fact that successfully training a neural network via weak supervision can require a large amount of signal. In this work, we seek to create neural networks that can learn from less experimental signal by using transfer and meta-learning. The general idea is to first train a neural network on simulations, thereby learning concepts that can be reused or becoming a more efficient learner. The neural network would then be trained on experimental data and should require less signal because of its previous training. We find that transfer and meta-learning can substantially improve the performance of weak supervision searches.</description>

      <title>Flavour-changing top quark decays in the alternative left-right model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine flavour-changing neutral-current decays of the top quark, $t\to q \gamma$, $t \to qZ$, $t \to q H$, and $ t\to q g$ (with $q=u, c$), in the Alternative Left-Right Model, a left right-symmetric model featuring exotic quarks and light bosons. These decays have a very small probability of occurring within the Standard Model, but they can be enhanced in this model through the presence of the exotic states. While associated signals may be detected directly at the LHC, rare decays have the advantage of offering means to probe new particles indirectly, through loop-contributions. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the model's parameter space to demonstrate the possible existence of enhancements in the corresponding branching ratios, of $10^6$ for the branching ratios $\mathcal{B}(t\to uZ)$ and $\mathcal{B}(t \to uH)$, and in the range of $10^{2} - 10^{4}$ for the other decays, relative to the Standard Model. We subsequently determine the preferred parameter space regions of the model in terms of potential of being reached in the near future.</description>

Abstract: Thermal dark matter, which, after chemical decoupling from the Standard Model thermal plasma rises its yield before it freezes-out, is a new feature of thermal DM scenarios dubbed as "Bouncing Dark Matter". In the following short note, we introduce the topic, exemplifying the mechanism with a simple model that extends the SM with two dark matter particles, a fermion, and a pNGB, plus a second Higgs. We explore the features of the thermal freeze-out of this scenario, with particular emphasis on the exponential growth of the yield of the pNGB. We test the model under collider bounds, relic abundance, direct detection, and we study prospects for indirect detection observables.</description>

      <title>Can quantum statistics help distinguish Dirac from Majorana neutrinos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding out if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles is known to be extremely difficult due to the smallness of neutrino mass and the fact that in the limit $m_\nu=0$ both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos become Weyl particles, i.e. are indistinguishable. There have been suggestions in the literature that in the case of processes with production of a neutrino-antineutrino pair (if neutrinos are Dirac particles) or two neutrinos (if they are of Majorana nature) quantum statistics may be of help. This is because for Majorana neutrinos quantum indistinguishability of identical particles requires the amplitude of the process to be antisymmetrized with respect to the interchange of the final-state neutrinos, whereas no such antisymmetrization must be done for Dirac neutrinos. It has been claimed that the resulting differences between the cross sections for Dirac and Majorana neutrinos persist even for arbitrarily small but not exactly vanishing neutrino mass. We demonstrate that, at least in the framework of the Standard Model, this is not the case. We also give a general proof that within the Standard Model quantum statistics does not help tell Dirac and Majorana neutrinos apart in the limit of negligibly small $m_\nu/E$.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that leverages infrared and collinear (IRC) safety and equivariance to enhance the analysis of collider data for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) discoveries. By integrating equivariance in the rapidity-azimuth plane with IRC-safe principles, our model significantly reduces computational overhead while ensuring theoretical consistency in identifying BSM scenarios amidst Quantum Chromodynamics backgrounds. The proposed GNN architecture demonstrates superior performance in tagging semi-visible jets, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for advancing BSM search strategies at high-energy colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we compute $\alpha_s$ corrections to the matching coefficients of the dimension six operators in the Heavy Quark Expansion of the inclusive semileptonic heavy hadron decay rate and leptonic invariant mass spectrum with a massless quark and both a massive or massless lepton in the final state, analytically. The obtained results can be applied to the inclusive semileptonic $B\rightarrow X_u \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ ($\ell = e,\,\mu,\,\tau$) and $D\rightarrow X \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ ($\ell = e,\,\mu$) decays. The main application of our results is the background subtraction of the $B\rightarrow X_u \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ decay in the measurement of the $B\rightarrow X_c\ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ decay, which is important for the precise extraction of $V_{cb}$ and $R(D^{(*)})$. They also play a role in the computation of lifetimes of heavy hadrons.</description>

      <title>Impact of nuclear deformation on collective flow observables in relativistic U+U collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model is used to investigate the efficacy of several flow observables to constrain the initial-state deformation of the Uranium nuclei in U$+$U collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{\textit{s}_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV. The multiparticle azimuthal cumulant method is used to investigate the sensitivity of (I) a set of quantities that are sensitive to both initial- and final-state effects as well as (II) a set of dimensionless quantities that are more sensitive to initial-state effects to the Uranium nuclei quadrupole shape deformation. We find that the combined use of the flow harmonics, flow fluctuations and correlations, linear and non-linear flow correlations to the quadrangular flow harmonic, and the correlations between elliptic flow and the mean-transverse momentum could serve to constrain the nuclear deformation of the Uranium nuclei. Therefore, a comprehensive set of measurements of such observables can provide a quantifying tool for the quadrupole shape deformation via data-model comparisons.</description>

      <title>Tensor Perturbations from Bounce Inflation Scenario in f(Q) Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a bounce inflation cosmological scenario in the framework of the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity, namely f(Q) theory, and investigate the tensor perturbations therein. As is well-known, the tensor perturbations generated in the very early Universe (inflation and pre-inflation regions) can account for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) that are to be detected by the next generation of GW experiments. We discuss the stability condition of the tensor perturbations in the bounce inflation process and investigate in detail the evolution of the perturbation variable. The general form of the tensor power spectrum is obtained both for large as well as small scale modes. As a result, we show for both kinds of modes (short or long wavelength modes), and the tensor spectrum may get a positive tilt in the parametric range where the tensor perturbation proves to be stable -- this interestingly hints an enhancement of gravitational waves' amplitude in the background of the f(Q) bounce-inflation scenario. Moreover, we study the LQC-like scenario as a specific case of our model, in which, the primordial tensor power spectrum turns out to be nearly scale-invariant on both small and large scales.</description>

Abstract: We perform a high-precision computation of the three-loop three-point form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. Both the leading-color and non-leading-color form factors are expanded in terms of simple integrals. We compute the complete set of integrals at a special kinematic point with very high precision using $\mathtt{AMFlow}$. The high-precision leading-color result enables us to obtain the analytic form of a numerical constant in the three-loop BDS ansatz, which is previously known only numerically. The high-precision values of the non-leading-color finite remainder as well as all integrals are also presented, which can be valuable for future use.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave triggered searches for high-energy neutrinos from binary neutron star mergers: prospects for next generation detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors -- Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) will have distance horizons up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ Gpc for detecting binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. This will make them ideal for triggering high-energy neutrino searches from BNS mergers at the next generation neutrino detectors, such as IceCube-Gen2. We calculate the distance limits as a function of the time window of neutrino analysis, up to which meaningful triggers from the GW detectors can be used to minimize backgrounds and collect a good sample of high-energy neutrino events at the neutrino detectors, using the sky localization capabilities of the GW detectors. We then discuss the prospects of the next generation detectors to work in synergy to facilitate coincident neutrino detections or to constrain the parameter space in the case of non-detection of neutrinos. We show that good localization of GW events, which can be achieved by multiple third generation GW detectors, is necessary to detect a GW-associated neutrino event or put a meaningful constraint ($\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level) on neutrino emission models. Such an analysis can also help constrain physical models and hence provide insights into neutrino production mechanisms in binary neutron star mergers.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the extension to finite temperatures and neutrino chemical potentials of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model approach to the equation of state of neutron star matter. We consider two light quark flavors and current-current interactions in the scalar-pseudoscalar, vector, and diquark pairing channels, where the nonlocality of the currents is taken into account by a Gaussian form factor that depends on the spatial components of the 4-momentum. Within this framework, we analyze order parameters, critical temperatures, phase diagrams, equations of state, and mass-radius relations for different temperatures and neutrino chemical potentials. For parameters of the model that are constrained by recent multi-messenger observations of neutron stars, we find that the mass-radius diagram for isothermal hybrid star sequences exhibits the thermal twin phenomenon for temperatures above 30 MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the traditional treatment of radiative corrections that utilizes the "true" neutrino momentum $\vec{p}_\nu$ in the differential decay rate formula could lead to a $\sim \alpha/\pi$ systematic error in certain observables due to the mistreatment of 4-body kinematics. We investigate the theory structure of one of the proposed solutions, the "$\nu'$-formalism", in the non-recoil limit appropriate for neutron and nuclear beta decays. We derive an elegant master formula for the 4-body phase space and use it to re-analyze the spectrum-dependent "outer" radiative corrections to the beta decay of a polarized spin-half nucleus; a complete set of analytic expressions is provided for readers to straightforwardly obtain the final numerical results. We compare it to the "recoil formalism" where the energy of the recoil nucleus is fixed.</description>

Abstract: Several SU(N) gauge theories have been explored as candidates for producing stable dark matter particles that can explain their relative abundance, while also evading current constraints from direct, indirect and collider searches. In this talk, I will present the confinement and spectral properties of a new model we name "Hyper Stealth Dark Matter", which involves an SU(4) gauge theory with 1 quark flavor. The lightest baryon in this theory can be a potential dark matter candidate as it is protected from decay and hence can evade detection with a mass of just a few GeV. Existence of a first order confinement transition would open the possibility of potential detection of gravitational waves from such a transition at future observatories.</description>
