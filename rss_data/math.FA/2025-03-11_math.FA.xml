      <title>The Hellinger-Kantorovich metric measure geometry on spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold with Riemannian distance $\mathsf{d}_g$, and $\mathcal{M}(M)$ be the space of all non-negative Borel measures on $M$, endowed with the Hellinger-Kantorovich distance $\mathsf{H\! K}_{\mathsf{d}_g}$ induced by $\mathsf{d}_g$.
  Firstly, we prove that $\left(\mathcal{M}(M),\mathsf{H\! K}_{\mathsf{d}_g}\right)$ is a universally infinitesimally Hilbertian metric space, and that a natural class of cylinder functions is dense in energy in the Sobolev space of every finite Borel measure on $\mathcal{M}(M)$.
  Secondly, we endow $\mathcal{M}(M)$ with its canonical reference measure, namely A.M. Vershik's multiplicative infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure $\mathcal{L}_\theta$, $\theta&gt;0$, and we consider: (a) the geometric structure on $\mathcal{M}(M)$ induced by the natural action on $\mathcal{M}(M)$ of the semi-direct product of diffeomorphisms and densities on $M$, under which $\mathcal{L}_\theta$ is the unique invariant measure; and (b) the metric measure structure of $\left(\mathcal{M}(M),\mathsf{H\! K}_{\mathsf{d}_g},\mathcal{L}_{\theta}\right)$, inherited from that of $(M,\mathsf{d}_g,\mathrm{vol}_g)$. We identify the canonical Dirichlet form $\left(\mathcal{E},\mathscr{D}(\mathcal{E})\right)$ of (a) with the Cheeger energy of (b), thus proving that these two structures coincide. We further prove that $\left(\mathcal{E},\mathscr{D}(\mathcal{E})\right)$ is a conservative quasi-regular strongly local Dirichlet form on $\mathcal{M}(M)$, recurrent if and only if $\theta\in (0,1]$, and properly associated with the Brownian motion of the Hellinger-Kantorovich geometry on $\mathcal{M}(M)$.</description>

      <title>Extension of continuous functions on product spaces, Bohr Compactification and Almost Periodic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bohr compactification is a well known construction for (topological) groups and semigroups. Recently, this notion has been investigated for arbitrary structures in \cite{har_kun:bohr_discrete} where the Bohr compactification is defined, using a set-theoretical approach, as the maximal compactification which is compatible with the structure involved. Here, we give a characterization of the continuous functions defined on a product space that can be extended continuously to certain compactifications of the product space. As a consequence, the Bohr compactification of an arbitrary topological structure is obtained as the Gelfand space of the commutative Banach algebra of all almost periodic functions. Previously, almost periodic functions $f$ are defined in terms of translates of $f$ with no reference to any compactification of the underlying structure. An application is given to the representation of isometries defined between spaces of almost periodic functions.</description>

      <title>Invariant Subspaces for Generalized Differentiation and Volterra Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a far-reaching generalization of the existent results about invariant subspaces of the differentiation operator $D=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ on $C^\infty(0,1)$ and the Volterra operator $Vf(t)=\int_0^tf(s)ds$, on $L^2(0,1)$. We use an abstract approach to study invariant subspaces of pairs $D,V$ with $DV=I$, where $V$ is compact and quasi-nilpotent and $D$ is unbounded densely defined and closed on the same Hilbert space. Our results cover many differential operators, like Schr\"odinger operators and a large class of other canonical systems, as well as the so-called compact self-adjoint operators with removable spectrum recently studied by Baranov and Yakubovich. Our methods are based on a model for such pairs which involves de Branges spaces of entire functions and plays a crucial role in the development. However, a number of difficulties arise from the fact that our abstract operators do not necessarily identify with the usual operators on such spaces, but with rank one perturbations of those, which, in terms of invariant subspaces creates a number of challenging problems.</description>

      <title>A counterexample of the Fredholm of Toeplitz operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the essential spectra of the Toeplitz operator on the Hardy space $H^1$. We give a counterexample to show that the Toeplitz operator with symbol is not Fredholm, which gives a counterexample to the conjecture by J.A. Virtanen J A in 2006.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Convergence of Higher-Order Phase Transition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior as $\varepsilon \to 0$ of singularly perturbed phase transition models of order $n \geq 2$, given by \begin{align}
  G_\varepsilon^{\lambda,n}[u] := \int_I \frac 1\varepsilon W(u) -\lambda\varepsilon^{2n-3} (u^{(n-1)})^2 + \varepsilon^{2n-1} (u^{(n)})^2 \ dx, \quad u \in W^{n,2}(I), \end{align}
  where $\lambda &gt;0$ is fixed, $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ is an open bounded interval, and $W \in C^0(\mathbb{R})$ is a suitable double-well potential. We find that there exists a positive critical parameter depending on $W$ and $n$, such that the $\Gamma$-limit of $G_\varepsilon^{\lambda,n}$ with respect to the $L^1$-topology is given by a sharp interface functional in the subcritical regime. The cornerstone for the corresponding compactness property is a novel nonlinear interpolation inequality involving higher-order derivatives, which is based on Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Towards a noncommutative theory of Cowen-Douglas class of noncommuting operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Cowen-Douglas class of (commuting tuples of) operators possessing an open set of (joint) eigenvalues of finite constant multiplicity was introduced by Cowen and Douglas, generalizing the backward shifts. Their unitary equivalence classes are determined by the equivalence classes of certain hermitian holomorphic vector bundles associated with them on this set.
  This article develops a free noncommutative analogue of Cowen-Douglas theory to explore the notion of vector bundles in the setting of free noncommutative function theory. We define the noncommutative Cowen-Douglas class using matricial joint eigenvalues, as envisioned by Taylor, and show via the Taylor-Taylor series that the associated joint eigenspaces naturally form such a vector bundle, what we call a noncommutative hermitian holomorphic vector bundle.
  A key result is that the unitary equivalence class of a tuple in this class is completely determined by the equivalence class of its associated noncommutative vector bundle. This work lays the groundwork of the noncommutative hermitian geometry, which investigates noncommutative analogues of complex manifolds, vector bundles, and hermitian metrics by drawing on ideas from both complex hermitian geometry and operator theory.
  We also examine noncommutative reproducing kernel Hilbert space models and introduce the noncommutative Gleason problem, showing that elements of the noncommutative Cowen-Douglas class are essentially (up to unitary equivalence) adjoints of left multiplication operators by noncommuting independent variables in a noncommutative reproducing kernel Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Polyhedrality for twisted sums with $C(\omega^\alpha)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain two partial answers to the 3-space problem for isomorphic polyhedrality: (1) every twisted sum of $C(\alpha)$, $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$, with a separable isomorphically polyhedral space with the BAP, is isomorphically polyhedral. (2) Every twisted sum of $c_0(\kappa)$ and a Banach space having a boundary with property $(*)$ has a boundary with property $(*)$, hence it is isomorphically polyhedral.</description>

      <title>Korn type Inequalities for Objective Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish discrete Korn type inequalities for particle systems within the general class of objective structures that represents a far reaching generalization of crystal lattice structures. For space filling configurations whose symmetry group is a general space group we obtain a full discrete Korn inequality. For systems with non-trivial codimension our results provide an intrinsic rigidity estimate within the extended dimensions of the structure. As their continuum counterparts in elasticity theory, such estimates are at the core of energy estimates and, hence, a stability analysis for a wide class of atomistic particle systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study isometries of quantum Wasserstein distances and divergences on the quantum bit state space. We describe isometries with respect to the symmetric quantum Wasserstein divergence $d_{sym}$, the divergence induced by all of the Pauli matrices. We also give a complete characterization of isometries with respect to $D_z$, the quantum Wasserstein distance corresponding to the single Pauli matrix $\sigma_z$.</description>

      <title>Statistical and Geometrical properties of regularized Kernel Kullback-Leibler divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical and geometrical properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with kernel covariance operators (KKL) introduced by Bach [2022]. Unlike the classical Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that involves density ratios, the KKL compares probability distributions through covariance operators (embeddings) in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and compute the Kullback-Leibler quantum divergence. This novel divergence hence shares parallel but different aspects with both the standard Kullback-Leibler between probability distributions and kernel embeddings metrics such as the maximum mean discrepancy. A limitation faced with the original KKL divergence is its inability to be defined for distributions with disjoint supports. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a regularised variant that guarantees that the divergence is well defined for all distributions. We derive bounds that quantify the deviation of the regularised KKL to the original one, as well as finite-sample bounds. In addition, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularised KKL, specifically applicable when the distributions consist of finite sets of points, which makes it implementable. Furthermore, we derive a Wasserstein gradient descent scheme of the KKL divergence in the case of discrete distributions, and study empirically its properties to transport a set of points to a target distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the exact Fourier dimension for all standard sub-critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos on the unit interval, thereby confirming the Garban-Vargas conjecture. The proof relies on a significant improvement of the vector-valued martingale method, initially developed by Chen-Han-Qiu-Wang in the studies of the Fourier dimensions of Mandelbrot cascade random measures.</description>

      <title>On the system of $2$-D elastic waves with critical space dependent damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the system of elastic waves with critical space dependent damping $V(x)$. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the $2$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\bf R}^{2}$, and we obtain faster decay rates of the total energy as time goes to infinity. In the $2$-D case we do not have any suitable Hardy type inequality, so generally one has no idea to establish optimal energy decay. We develope a special type of multiplier method combined with some estimates brought by the $2$-D Newton potential belonging to the usual Laplacian $-\Delta$, not the operator $-a^2\Delta - (b^{2}-a^{2})\nabla {\rm div}$ itself. The property of finite speed propagation is important to get results for this system.</description>
