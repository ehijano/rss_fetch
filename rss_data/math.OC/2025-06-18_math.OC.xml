      <title>On {\lambda}-Cent-Dians and Generalized-Center for Network Design: Formulations and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $\lambda$-centdian problem in the domain of Network Design. The focus is on designing a sub-network within a given underlying network while adhering to a budget constraint. This sub-network is intended to efficiently serve a collection of origin/destination demand pairs. We extend the work presented in \cite{bucarey2024on}, providing an algorithmic perspective on the generalized $\lambda$-centdian problem. In particular, we provide a mathematical formulation for $\lambda\geq 0$ and discuss the bilevel structure of this problem for $\lambda&gt;1$. Furthermore, we describe a procedure to obtain a complete parametrization of the Pareto-optimality set based on solving two mixed integer linear formulations by introducing the concept of maximum $\lambda$-cent-dian. We evaluate the quality of the different solution concepts using some inequality measures. Finally, for $\lambda\in[0,1]$, we study the implementation of a Benders decomposition method to solve it at scale.</description>

      <title>An efficient co-simulation and control approach to tackle complex multi-domain energetic systems: concepts and applications of the PEGASE platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel research software, called PEGASE, suitable for the design, validation and deployment of advanced control strategies for complex multi-domain energy systems. PEGASE especially features a highly efficient cosimulation engine, together with integrated solutions for defining both rule-based control strategies and Model-Predictive Control (MPC). The main principle behind the PEGASE platform is divide-and-conquer. Indeed, rather than trying to solve a problem as a monolithic entity, which can be highly complex for multi-domain large-scale systems, it is often more efficient to decompose it into several domains or sub-problems, and to simulate them in a decoupled way. To provide its cosimulation capabilities, we based PEGASE on two main components. The first one is a framework for integrating simulation models, which can be either compatible with the FMI standard or interfaced through an Application Programming Interface (API). The second one is a multi-threaded sequencer enabling several simulation sequences with different time steps. To provide advanced control capabilities, we also equipped PEGASE with a framework for MPC combining a comprehensive management of predictions data and a modeler dedicated to the formulation of Mixed Integer Linear Programs. We implemented this framework in C++ providing low formulation and resolution times for typical applications. Connection to hardware is also available via standard industry protocols thereby allowing PEGASE to control real energy systems. In this paper, we show how these basic functionalities, combined with dedicated modeling tools, enable setting up simulation and control applications suitable for tackling the complexity of various kinds of energy systems. To illustrate this, we present four application examples from our recent research work. These examples cover several domains, from concentrated solar thermal plants to optimal control of district heating networks. The variety of examples demonstrates the robustness and genericity of the approach.</description>

      <title>Operational Control of a Multi-energy District Heating System: Comparison of Model-Predictive Control and Rule-Based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on operational control strategies for a multi-energy District Heating Network (DHN). Two control strategies are investigated and compared: (i) a reactive rule-based control (RBC) and (ii) a model predictive control (MPC). For the purpose of the study a small scale district heating network is modelled using Modelica. The production plant combines a heat pump, a gas boiler and a thermal solar field on the production side with a storage tank for flexibility purposes. On the consumption side, the virtual buildings are aggregated into a single consumer. We use our co-simulation and control platform, called Pegase, to implement the studied strategies. For both strategies the goal is to meet the consumers' demand while satisfying technical constraints. In addition MPC has the objective to minimize the operational costs, taking into account variable electricity prices and availability of solar thermal resource. Different scenarios are also defined and compared to study the effect of the heat plant sizing and forecasting error. The operational cost is reduced when switching from RBC to a MPC. As can be expected, MPC is more efficient when dealing with variable energy costs, intermittent solar energy and storage capabilities. This study also demonstrates how our tools enable an easy coupling of Modelica-based simulation with various control strategies. It especially supports the implementation and validation of complex MPC strategies in an efficient way, and yearly simulations are performed within 20 minutes.</description>

      <title>Contribution of expert aggregation to temperature prediction part II: Second order bounds with sleeping experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we improve on the temperature predictions made with (online) Expert Aggregation (EA) [Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006] in Part I. In particular, we make the aggregation more reactive, whilst maintaining at least the same root mean squared error and reducing the number of large errors. We have achieved this by using the Sleeping Expert Framework (SEF) [Freund et al., 1997, Devaine et al., 2013], which allows the more efficient use of biased experts (bad on average but which may be good at some point). To deal with the fact that, unlike in Devaine et al. [2013], we do not know in advance when to use these biased experts, we resorted to gradient boosted regression trees [Chen and Guestrin, 2016] and provide regret bounds against sequences of experts [Mourtada and Maillard, 2017] which take into account this uncertainty. We applied this in a fully online way on BOA [Wintenberger, 2024], an adaptive aggregation with second order regret bounds, which had the best results in Part I. Finally, we made a meta-aggregation with the EA follow the leader. This chooses whether or not to use the SEF in order to limit the possible noise added by the SEF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and their associated Model Output Statistics (MOS) are available. Combining all of these predictions in an optimal way is however not straightforward. This can be achieved thanks to Expert Aggregation (EA) [Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006, Gaillard et al., 2014, Wintenberger, 2024] which has many advantages, such as being online, being adaptive to model changes and having theoretical guarantees. Hence, in this paper, we propose a method for making deterministic temperature predictions with EA strategies and show how this can improve temperature predictions, even those of post processed NWP models. We also compare different EA strategies in various settings and discuss certain limitations.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Eigenfunctions and Matrix Lyapunov Equations from Energy Balance Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a unified theoretical framework that connects classical orthogonal polynomial systems to matrix Lyapunov equations through the fundamental physics of energy dissipation in stochastic dynamical systems. Starting from the energy balance principle in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we derive a master integral representation that naturally encompasses both spectral geometry and covariance dynamics. The theory reveals that established orthogonal polynomials (Zernike, Hermite, spherical harmonics) and matrix Lyapunov equations are dual manifestations of the same underlying energy dissipation structure. We provide rigorous mathematical foundations showing how finite-dimensional projections of infinite-dimensional energy integrals reproduce classical matrix equations, with specific structure determined by the symmetries of noise processes. The framework demonstrates that adding uniform dissipation to classical differential operators preserves their polynomial eigenfunction structure while ensuring the energy balance conditions required for physical consistency.</description>

      <title>Proximal Operators of Sorted Nonconvex Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm (SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Thin-Film Flow on a Flexible Topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a mathematical model for the optimal control of thin-film flows over a flexible topography influenced by an external force. Our thin-film model allows for the rupture of films as well as the coalescence of bubbles. The objective is to find the optimal distributed force acting on the topography that minimises the differences between actual and desired thin-film profiles. A nonlinear lubrication equation governing the fluid dynamics and appropriate functional settings for this model are presented. It is also shown that this system satisfies a global energy-dissipation law for a suitable energy functional. Optimality conditions are derived for the solution of the minimisation problem of a specified cost function across a time horizon. These conditions are formulated at a continuous level as a system of coupled, forward-backward PDEs, which are subsequently discretised for numerical investigation. To ensure computational efficiency and stability, first-order Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) time-stepping schemes are employed to handle the nonlinearities in the model, and a reduced gradient descent algorithm is applied to obtain a numerical approximation of the optimal control signal. Numerical results illustrate that controlling the thin film, even during rupture, achieves a precise film profile. This control strategy accelerates convergence towards a steady state, reduces instabilities, stabilises dewetting processes, and meets the desired profile specifications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding for Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding (MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also $\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Mirror Descent Stochastic Approximation for Multi-Stage Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the unconstrained and the minimax saddle point variants of the convex multi-stage stochastic programming problem, where consecutive decisions are coupled through the objective functions, rather than through the constraints. Based on the analysis of deterministic mirror descent algorithms with inexact gradients, we introduce the idea of \textit{stochastic conditional gradient oracles}, a multi-stage analog of the stochastic gradient oracles used in (classical) stochastic programming. We show one approach to construct such oracles and prove the convergence of the (accelerated) mirror descent stochastic approximation, both in expectation and with high probability. To further reduce the oracle complexity, we view the problem from a \textit{semi-online} perspective, where the stage $t$ decision variables are constructed $s$ stages in advance, instead of before stage $1$. We show that the delay in decision making allows an asynchronous implementation of the mirror descent stochastic approximation algorithms. By avoiding computing solutions for scenarios that are inconsistent with information available during stage $t$, the complexity is reduced from exponential to linear in the number of stages.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Classical Regression Methods for Optimal Switching Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple regression methods provide robust, near-optimal solutions for optimal switching problems in dimensions ranging from 1 to 50. While the theory requires solving intractable PDE systems, the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm with classical approaches like $k$-NN achieves excellent switching decisions without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Testing eight regression approaches on four benchmark problems, we find that simple methods maintain stable performance across diverse problem characteristics, even after extensive neural network optimization. The contaminated training targets inherent to backward induction-where each target contains both approximation bias and Monte Carlo noise-actually favor these robust approaches over more complex alternatives such as neural networks. Further, we establish concentration bounds for $k$-NN regression under jump-diffusion dynamics and show that PCA enables $k$-NN to scale to high dimensions. For practitioners: simple, minimally-tuned regression methods offer reliable performance for computationally demanding switching problems.</description>

      <title>A polynomial projective algorithm for convex feasibility problems with positive-definite constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of projective transformations of spectraplexes associated with self-dual cones and, on this basis, propose a polynomial-time algorithm for convex feasibility problems with positive definite constraints. At each iteration of the algorithm, either a feasible solution is found or a suitable valid inequality inducing a projective transformation allowing to bring the solution set closer to the center of an associated spectraplex. The closeness to the center is measured in terms of a potential function. The running time of our algorithm makes the existing complexity bounds more precise for the case when the number of equations linking the positive definite variable matrices is not less than the sum of the ranks of the respective positive-semidefinite cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents sufficient conditions for optimal control of systems with dynamics given by a linear operator, in order to obtain an explicit solution to the Bellman equation that can be calculated in a distributed fashion. Further, the class of Linearly Solvable MDP is reformulated as a continuous-state optimal control problem. It is shown that this class naturally satisfies the conditions for explicit solution of the Bellman equation, motivating the extension of previous results to semilinear dynamics to account for input nonlinearities. The applicability of the given conditions is illustrated in scenarios with linear and quadratic cost, corresponding to the Stochastic Shortest Path and Linear-Quadratic Regulator problems.</description>

      <title>Primal-Dual Coordinate Descent for Nonconvex-Nonconcave Saddle Point Problems Under the Weak MVI Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two novel primal-dual algorithms for addressing nonconvex, nonconcave, and nonsmooth saddle point problems characterized by the weak Minty Variational Inequality (MVI). The first algorithm, Nonconvex-Nonconcave Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (NC-PDHG), extends the well-known Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) method to this challenging problem class. The second algorithm, Nonconvex-Nonconcave Stochastic Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (NC-SPDHG), incorporates a randomly extrapolated primal-dual coordinate descent approach, extending the Stochastic Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (SPDHG) algorithm.
  To our knowledge, designing a coordinate-based algorithm to solve nonconvex-nonconcave saddle point problems is unprecedented, and proving its convergence posed significant difficulties. This challenge motivated us to utilize PEPit, a Python-based tool for computer-assisted worst-case analysis of first-order optimization methods. By integrating PEPit with automated Lyapunov function techniques, we successfully derived the NC-SPDHG algorithm.
  Both methods are effective under a mild condition on the weak MVI parameter, achieving convergence with constant step sizes that adapt to the structure of the problem. Numerical experiments on logistic regression with squared loss and perceptron-regression problems validate our theoretical findings and show their efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, where linear convergence is observed. Additionally, we conduct a convex-concave least-squares experiment to show that NC-SPDHG performs competitively with SAGA, a leading algorithm in the smooth convex setting.</description>

      <title>Heavy Ball and Nesterov Accelerations with Hessian-driven Damping for Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a second-order dynamical system with Hessian-driven damping tailored for a class of nonconvex functions called strongly quasiconvex. Buil\-ding upon this continuous-time model, we derive two discrete-time gra\-dient-based algorithms through time discretizations. The first is a Heavy Ball method with Hessian correction, incorporating cur\-va\-tu\-re-dependent terms that arise from discretizing the Hessian damping component. The second is a Nesterov-type accelerated method with adaptive momentum, fea\-tu\-ring correction terms that account for local curvature. Both algorithms aim to enhance stability and convergence performance, particularly by mi\-ti\-ga\-ting oscillations commonly observed in cla\-ssi\-cal momentum me\-thods. Furthermore, in both cases we establish li\-near convergence to the optimal solution for the iterates and functions values. Our approach highlights the rich interplay between continuous-time dynamics and discrete optimization algorithms in the se\-tting of strongly quasiconvex objectives. Numerical experiments are presented to support obtained results.</description>

      <title>Faster Computation of Entropic Optimal Transport via Stable Low Frequency Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an accelerated version for the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is the reference method for computing the solution to Entropic Optimal Transport.
  Its main draw-back is the exponential slow-down of convergence as the regularization weakens $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$.
  Thanks to spectral insights on the behavior of the Hessian, we propose to mitigate the problem via an original spectral warm-start strategy. This leads to faster convergence compared to the reference method, as also demonstrated in our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.</description>

      <title>GLASD: A Loss-Function-Agnostic Global Optimizer for Robust Correlation Estimation under Data Contamination and Heavy Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust correlation estimation is essential in high-dimensional settings, particularly when data are contaminated by outliers or exhibit heavy-tailed behavior. Many robust loss functions of practical interest-such as those involving truncation or redescending M-estimators-lead to objective functions that are inherently non-convex and non-differentiable. Traditional methods typically focus on a single loss function tailored to a specific contamination model and develop custom algorithms tightly coupled with that loss, limiting generality and adaptability. We introduce GLASD (Global Adaptive Stochastic Descent), a general-purpose black-box optimization algorithm designed to operate over the manifold of positive definite correlation matrices. Unlike conventional solvers, GLASD requires no gradient information and imposes no assumptions of convexity or smoothness, making it ideally suited for optimizing a wide class of loss functions-including non-convex, non-differentiable, or discontinuous objectives. This flexibility allows GLASD to serve as a unified framework for robust estimation under arbitrary user-defined criteria. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations involving contaminated and heavy-tailed distributions, as well as a real-data application to breast cancer proteomic network inference, where GLASD successfully identifies biologically plausible interactions despite the presence of outliers. The proposed method is scalable, constraint-aware, and available as open-source software at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods rely on the positive definite property of the Euclidean metric, and do not easily extend to the indefinite Minkowski metric. In this paper, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The method we outline is conceptually simple and easily extends to alignment problems in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>2BSDE with uncertain horizon and application to stochastic control in erratic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and uniqueness of non-Markovian second-order backward stochastic differential equations with an uncertain terminal horizon and establish comparison principles under the assumption that the driver is Lipschitz continuous. The terminal time is both random and exogenous, and it may not be adapted to the Brownian filtration, leading to a singular jump in the 2BSDE decomposition. We also provide a connection between this new class of 2BSDE and a fully nonlinear PDE in a Markovian setting. Our theoretical results are applied to non-Markovian stochastic control problems in two settings: (1) when an agent seeks to maximize utility from a payoff received at an uncertain terminal time by controlling both the drift and volatility of a diffusion process; and (2) when the agent contends with volatility uncertainty stemming from an external source, referred to as Nature, and optimizes the drift in a worst-case scenario for the ambiguous volatility. We term this class of problems erratic stochastic control, reflecting the dual uncertainty in both model parameters and the timing of the terminal horizon.</description>

      <title>Muon Optimizes Under Spectral Norm Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$, allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and constrained optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Structural Vibrations via Guided Flow Matching Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required. We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives, including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from https://github.com/ecker-lab/Optimizing_Vibrating_Plates.</description>

      <title>DOVA-PATBM: An Intelligent, Adaptive, and Scalable Framework for Optimizing Large-Scale EV Charging Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.</description>

      <title>When and How Unlabeled Data Provably Improve In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference.</description>

      <title>Superpositions for General Conditional Mckean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the connection between a general class of Conditional Mckean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (CMVSDEs) and its corresponding (infinite dimensional) Conditional Fokker-Planck Equation. The CMVSDE under consideration is similar to the one studied in [4], which is a non-trivial generalization of the McKean-Vlasov SDE with common noise and is closely related to a new type of non-linear Zakai equation that has not been studied in the literature. The main purpose of this paper is to establish the superposition principles among the three subjects so that their well-posedness can imply each other. More precisely, we shall first prove the superposition principle between the non-linear Zakai equation, a non-linear measure-valued stochastic PDE, and a CMVSDE; and then prove the superposition principle between an infinite dimensional conditional Fokker-Planck equation and the nonlinear Zakai equations. It is worth noting that none of the (weak) well-posedness of these SDEs/SPDEs in such generality have been investigated in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an advanced surgical treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), involving electrical stimulation of neurons within the basal ganglia region of the brain. DBS is traditionally delivered in an open-loop manner using fixed stimulation parameters, which may lead to suboptimal results. In an effort to overcome these limitations, closed loop DBS, using pathological subthalamic beta (13--30 Hz) activity as a feedback signal, offers the potential to adapt DBS automatically in response to changes in patient symptoms and side effects. However, clinically implemented closed-loop techniques have been limited to date to simple control algorithms, due to the inherent uncertainties in the dynamics involved. Model-free control, which has already seen successful applications in the field of bioengineering, offers a way to avoid this limitation and provides an alternative method to apply modern control approach to selective suppression of pathological oscillations.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Analysis of SGD for Linear Regression with Weight Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools, bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the training of realistic models.</description>

      <title>Time Scale Separation and Hierarchical Control with the Koopman Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman Operator (KO) is a mathematical construct that maps nonlinear (state space) dynamics to corresponding linear dynamics in an infinite-dimensional functional space. For practical applications, finite-dimensional approximations can be constructed with machine learning. The linearity of the KO facilitates the use of linear tools and theories on nonlinear dynamical systems without relying on local approximations. Additionally, the KO has the ability to incorporate forms of domain knowledge such as stability and known variable interactions. It therefore constitutes part of the broader interest in domain-aware or physics-informed machine learning. Hierarchical control and time scale separation are two common properties in engineered systems -- often found together -- that can pose both computational and practical challenges. These properties provide opportunities for further KO-based domain knowledge incorporation, but this has seldom been taken advantage of in the KO literature. This paper focuses on developing and using domain-aware Koopman formulations for systems with hierarchical control, systems with time scale separation, and systems with both. We show how those formulations can be leveraged to quantify the impact of cross-scale interactions on overall stability and to calculate optimal control policies at both fast and slow time scales.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent, Multi-Scale Systems with the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman Operator (KO) takes nonlinear state dynamics and ``lifts'' those dynamics to an infinite-dimensional functional space of observables in which those dynamics are linear. Computational applications typically use a finite-dimensional approximation to the KO. The KO can also be applied to controlled dynamical systems, and the linearity of the KO then facilitates analysis and control calculations. In principle, the potential benefits provided by the KO, and the way that it facilitates the use of game theory via its linearity, would suggest it as a powerful approach for dealing with multi-agent control problems. In practice, though, there has not been much work in this space: most multi-agent KO work has treated those agents as different components of a single system rather than as distinct decision-making entities. This paper develops a KO formulation for multi-agent systems that structures the interactions between decision-making agents and extends this formulation to systems in which the agents have hierarchical control structures and time scale separated dynamics. We solve the multi-agent control problem in both cases as both a centralized optimization and as a general-sum game theory problem. The comparison of the two sets of optimality conditions defining the control solutions illustrates how coupling between agents can create differences between the social optimum and the Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Majorant Algorithm for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a fundamental tool in unsupervised learning, widely used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, representation learning, and topic modeling. Many algorithms have been developed for NMF, including the well-known Multiplicative Updates (MU) algorithm, which belongs to a broader class of majorization-minimization techniques. In this work, we introduce a general second-order optimization framework for NMF under both quadratic and $\beta$-divergence loss functions. This approach, called Second-Order Majorant (SOM), constructs a local quadratic majorization of the loss function by majorizing its Hessian matrix. It includes MU as a special case, while enabling faster variants. In particular, we propose mSOM, a new algorithm within this class that leverages a tighter local approximation to accelerate convergence. We provide a convergence analysis, showing linear convergence for individual factor updates and global convergence to a stationary point for the alternating version, AmSOM algorithm. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that mSOM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms across multiple loss functions.</description>

      <title>Solving decision problems with endogenous uncertainty and conditional information revelation using influence diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02338v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical programming formulations of influence diagrams can bridge the gap between representing and solving decision problems. However, they suffer from both modeling and computational limitations. Aiming to address modeling limitations, we show how to incorporate conditionally observed information within the mathematical programming representation of the influence diagram. Multi-stage stochastic programming models use conditional non-anticipativity constraints to represent such uncertainties, and we show how such constraints can be incorporated into the influence diagram formulations. This allows us to consider the two main types of endogenous uncertainty simultaneously, namely decision-dependent information structure and decision-dependent probability distribution.
  Additionally, we apply a subdiagram decomposition to improve both computational efficiency and modeling capabilities. Under suitable conditions, this decomposition allows for considering continuous decision variables arising from, e.g., investment sizing decisions, leading to better solutions than a discretization of the continuous decisions. Finally, our proposed framework is illustrated with a large-scale cost-benefit problem regarding climate change mitigation, simultaneously considering technological research and development, and optimal emission trajectories.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of controlled particle systems arising in deep learning: from finite to infinite sample size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with a class of neural SDEs and studies the limiting behavior of the associated sampled optimal control problems as the sample size grows to infinity. The neural SDEs with $N$ samples can be linked to the $N$-particle systems with centralized control. We analyze the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the $N$-particle system and establish regularity results which are uniform in $N$. The uniform regularity estimates are obtained by the stochastic maximum principle and the analysis of a backward stochastic Riccati equation. Using these uniform regularity results, we show the convergence of the minima of the objective functionals and optimal parameters of the neural SDEs as the sample size $N$ tends to infinity. The limiting objects can be identified with suitable functions defined on the Wasserstein space of Borel probability measures. Furthermore, quantitative convergence rates are also obtained.</description>

      <title>$k$-Submodular Interdiction Problems under Distributional Risk-Receptiveness and Robustness: Application to Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13023v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study submodular optimization in adversarial context, applicable to machine learning problems such as feature selection using data susceptible to uncertainties and attacks. We focus on Stackelberg games between an attacker (or interdictor) and a defender where the attacker aims to minimize the defender's objective of maximizing a $k$-submodular function. We allow uncertainties arising from the success of attacks and inherent data noise, and address challenges due to incomplete knowledge of the probability distribution of random parameters. Specifically, we introduce Distributionally Robust $k$-Submodular Interdiction Problem (DRO $k$-SIP) and Distributionally Risk-Receptive $k$-Submodular Interdiction Problem (DRR $k$-SIP) along with finitely convergent exact algorithms for solving them. When solving the DRO $k$-SIP, the attacker optimizes their expected payoff with respect to the worst-case probability distribution within the ambiguity set, and thereby have robust attack strategies despite distributional ambiguity. In contrast, the DRR $k$-SIP identifies attacker strategies with the best-case probability distribution, and identifies critical vulnerabilities for the defender. The optimal values derived from both DRO $k$-SIP and DRR $k$-SIP offer a confidence interval-like range for the expected value of the defender's objective function, capturing distributional ambiguity. We conduct computational experiments on instances of feature selection and sensor placement problems, using Wisconsin breast cancer data and synthetic data, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Convex-Nonconvex Framework for Enhancing Minimization Induced Penalties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for nonconvex enhancement of minimization induced (MI) penalties while preserving the overall convexity of associated regularization models. MI penalties enable the adaptation to certain signal structures via minimization, but often underestimate significant components owing to convexity. To overcome this shortcoming, we design a generalized Moreau enhanced minimization induced (GME-MI) penalty by subtracting from the MI penalty its generalized Moreau envelope. While the proposed GME-MI penalty is nonconvex in general, we derive an overall convexity condition for the GME-MI regularized least-squares model. Moreover, we present a proximal splitting algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a globally optimal solution of the GME-MI model under the overall convexity condition. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Coherent Local Explanations for Mathematical Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surge of explainable artificial intelligence methods seeks to enhance transparency and explainability in machine learning models. At the same time, there is a growing demand for explaining decisions taken through complex algorithms used in mathematical optimization. However, current explanation methods do not take into account the structure of the underlying optimization problem, leading to unreliable outcomes. In response to this need, we introduce Coherent Local Explanations for Mathematical Optimization (CLEMO). CLEMO provides explanations for multiple components of optimization models, the objective value and decision variables, which are coherent with the underlying model structure. Our sampling-based procedure can provide explanations for the behavior of exact and heuristic solution algorithms. The effectiveness of CLEMO is illustrated by experiments for the shortest path problem, the knapsack problem, and the vehicle routing problem.</description>

      <title>Towards net-zero manufacturing: carbon-aware scheduling for GHG emissions reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detailed scheduling has traditionally been optimized for the reduction of makespan and manufacturing costs. However, growing awareness of environmental concerns and increasingly stringent regulations are pushing manufacturing towards reducing the carbon footprint of its operations. Scope 2 emissions, which are the indirect emissions related to the production and consumption of grid electricity, are in fact estimated to be responsible for more than one-third of the global GHG emissions. In this context, carbon-aware scheduling can serve as a powerful way to reduce manufacturing's carbon footprint by considering the time-dependent carbon intensity of the grid and the availability of on-site renewable electricity.
  This study introduces a carbon-aware permutation flow-shop scheduling model designed to reduce scope 2 emissions. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear problem, taking into account the forecasted grid generation mix and available on-site renewable electricity, along with the set of jobs to be scheduled and their corresponding power requirements. The objective is to find an optimal day-ahead schedule that minimizes scope 2 emissions. The problem is addressed using a dedicated memetic algorithm, combining evolutionary strategy and local search.
  Results from computational experiments confirm that by considering the dynamic carbon intensity of the grid and on-site renewable electricity availability, substantial reductions in carbon emissions can be achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter we propose an optimization-based boundary controller for traffic flow dynamics capable of achieving both stability and invariance conditions. The approach is based on the definition of Boundary Control Barrier Functionals, from which sets of invariance-preserving boundary controllers are derived. In combination with sets of stabilizing controllers, we reformulate the problem as a convex optimization program solved at each point in time to synthesize the boundary control inputs. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal controllers that ensure both stability and invariance.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Stability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems Under Monotone Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness and stability of an impedance passive infinite-dimensional linear system under nonlinear feedback of the form $u(t)=\phi(v(t)-y(t))$, where $\phi$ is a monotone function. Our first main result introduces conditions guaranteeing the existence of classical and generalised solutions in a situation where the original linear system is well-posed. In the absence of the external input $v$ we establish the existence of strong and generalised solutions under strictly weaker conditions. Finally, we introduce conditions guaranteeing that the origin is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the closed-loop system. Motivated by the analysis of partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, we use our results to investigate the well-posedness and stablility of abstract boundary control systems, port-Hamiltonian systems, a Timoshenko beam model, and a two-dimensional boundary controlled heat equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the convergence properties of the inexact Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme and proximal-gradient algorithm in the context of Wasserstein spaces. The JKO scheme, a widely-used method for approximating solutions to gradient flows in Wasserstein spaces, typically assumes exact solutions to iterative minimization problems. However, practical applications often require approximate solutions due to computational limitations. This work focuses on the convergence of the scheme to minimizers for the underlying functional and addresses these challenges by analyzing two types of inexactness: errors in Wasserstein distance and errors in energy functional evaluations. The paper provides rigorous convergence guarantees under controlled error conditions, demonstrating that weak convergence can still be achieved with inexact steps. The analysis is further extended to proximal-gradient algorithms, showing that convergence is preserved under inexact evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of distributed optimization is studied via a network of agents. Each agent only has access to a noisy gradient of its own objective function, and can communicate with its neighbors via a network. To handle this problem, a distributed clipped stochastic gradient descent algorithm is proposed, and the high probability convergence of the algorithm is studied. Existing works on distributed algorithms involving stochastic gradients only consider the light-tailed noises. Different from them, we study the case with heavy-tailed settings. Under mild assumptions on the graph connectivity, we prove that the algorithm converges in high probability under a certain clipping operator. Finally, a simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study continuous stochastic games with heterogeneous mean field interactions and jumps on large networks and explore their limit counterparts. We introduce the graphon game model based on a controlled graphon mean field stochastic differential equation system with jumps, which can be regarded as the limiting case of a finite game dynamic system as the number of players goes to infinity. We examine the case of controlled dynamics, with control terms present in the drift, diffusion, and jump components. We focus on the study of Markovian controls and concentrate on the limit theory. We provide convergence results on the state trajectories and their laws, transitioning from finite game systems to graphon systems. We also study approximate equilibria for finite games on large networks, using the graphon equilibrium as a benchmark. The rates of convergence are analyzed under various underlying graphon models and regularity assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel optimal transport framework for probabilistic circuits (PCs). While it has been shown recently that divergences between distributions represented as certain classes of PCs can be computed tractably, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing approach to compute the Wasserstein distance between probability distributions given by PCs. We propose a Wasserstein-type distance that restricts the coupling measure of the associated optimal transport problem to be a probabilistic circuit. We then develop an algorithm for computing this distance by solving a series of small linear programs and derive the circuit conditions under which this is tractable. Furthermore, we show that we can easily retrieve the optimal transport plan between the PCs from the solutions to these linear programs. Lastly, we study the empirical Wasserstein distance between a PC and a dataset, and show that we can estimate the PC parameters to minimize this distance through an efficient iterative algorithm.</description>

      <title>CISSIR: Beam Codebooks with Self-Interference Reduction Guarantees for Integrated Sensing and Communication Beyond 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a beam codebook design to reduce self-interference (SI) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our optimization methods, which can be applied to both tapered beamforming and phased arrays, adapt the codebooks to the SI channel such that a certain SI level is achieved. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound on the quantization noise in terms of the achieved SI level, which provides guidelines to pose the optimization problem in order to obtain performance guarantees for sensing. By selecting standard reference codebooks in our simulations, we show substantially improved sensing quality with little impact on 5G-NR communication. Our proposed method is not only less dependent on hyperparameters than other approaches in the literature, but it can also reduce SI further, and thus deliver better sensing and communication performance.</description>
