      <title>High frame rate RIXS spectroscopy using a JUNGFRAU detector with an iLGAD sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is a powerful photon-in, photon-out spectroscopy technique for probing electronic, magnetic, and lattice excitations in matter. Time-resolved RIXS extends this capability through a stroboscopic optical pump-probe scheme to characterize the time evolution of the photoexcitation and subsequent relaxation dynamics of a sample. This technique is, however, extremely photon-hungry, requiring high-repetition-rate and intense X-ray facilities. The Heisenberg RIXS (hRIXS) spectrometer at the Spectroscopy and Coherent Scattering (SCS) instrument of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL) is designed to exploit high-repetition-rates, while maintaining optimal time and energy resolution. In this work, we demonstrate the successful deployment of a JUNGFRAU detector equipped with an inverse Low Gain Avalanche Diode (iLGAD) sensor for time-resolved RIXS studies in the soft X-ray range, using the hRIXS spectrometer. A spatial resolution of $19.71 \pm 0.7~\mu\mathrm{m}$ and a resolving power exceeding 10,000 were achieved at an unprecedented frame rate of 47 kHz. Intra-train resolved data measured with a high FEL peak fluence of $1.8~\mathrm{mJ/cm^{2}}$ for a 928.5 eV ph photon energy and 1.1 MHz repetition rate from cupric oxide (CuO) revealed a decrease in the emitted signal by ~10% over a time interval of $340~\mu\mathrm{s}$, indicating FEL-induced effects that require monitoring when conducting high-repetition-rate experiments. These results establish the JUNGFRAU-iLGAD as a promising detector to harvest the full potential of the hRIXS spectrometer, and validate its suitability for soft X-ray applications.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Measurement of the X-ARAPUCA's Absolute Photon Detection Efficiency for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment's Vertical Drift Far Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will probe fundamental questions in particle physics and cosmology. Its Far Detectors implement a Photon Detection System composed of light-sensitive devices called X-ARAPUCA (XA). These trap incoming VUV photons by total internal reflection in a Wavelength Shifter Light Guide to be collected onto wrapping Silicon Photomultiplier arrays, sensitive to visible light. In the baseline design, Dichroic Filters (DFs) are implemented to improve the collection efficiency of escaping photons. The configuration proposed for DUNE's Vertical Drift module has been characterised in Liquid Argon for the first time using dedicated cryogenic setups developed at CIEMAT and INFN Naples. Additionally, several alternative configurations, based on the design optimisation studies of an R&amp;D campaign, have been evaluated. The results show an efficiency of up to 4.5 $\pm$ 0.4% at 4.5 V overvoltage, representing a high improvement with respect to previous XA implementations. Most noticeably, configurations without DFs show an improvement of up to 18%, which has been attributed to transmittance deficits.</description>

      <title>From the Virgo interferometer calibration to the bias and uncertainty of the h(t) detector strain during the O4 run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first gravitational wave detection in 2015, ground-based interferometer sensitivities have significantly improved, requiring highly precise calibration to ensure accurate reconstruction of the h(t) strain signal. In this talk we will outline the Virgo interferometer calibration steps performed in preparation of the O4b run started in April 2024. We will first describe the Photon Calibrator power devices intercalibration allowing for a 0.48% precision on mirror displacement. Before explaining how the Photon Calibrator is used to calibrate every Virgo mirror actuators. We will also discuss the monitoring of the h(t) strain reconstruction during the run showing that, on the 10 Hz to 2 kHz band, the reconstructed strain achieves a precision of 2% in modulus and 30 mrad in phase. Special emphasis will be given on the newly developed frequency-dependent bias and uncertainty computation method and the resulting online unbiasing of the h(t) strain.</description>

      <title>Finding Trafficked Radiological Materials via Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential to use neutrinos for nuclear non-proliferation has been heavily debated due to the tension between production abundance and low interaction rate. A newly detected neutrino interaction channel, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS), could potentially end this debate due to its improved cross-section compared to other neutrino interactions. This paper presents a feasibility study for the use of CE$\nu$NS superconducting detectors to find trafficked radiological materials. To do this, we calculated the minimal activity required for situational detection under ideal conditions, without background, at 95% confidence level. This analysis was performed for four commonly smuggled radioisotopes: $^{137}$Cs, $^{109}$Cd, $^{192}$Ir, and $^{57}$Co. Using these results, we conclude that CE$\nu$NS could be used to discover trafficked $^{137}$Cs sources with an activity above the PBq level, but that it is not applicable for finding other radioactive sources. This framework can also be applied to other nuclear security concerns, such as safeguarding generation IV nuclear reactors.</description>

      <title>Charge carrier generation in RNDR-DEPFET Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depleted p-channel field effect transistor detectors with repetitive-non-destructive readout (RNDR-DEPFETs) achieve a deep sub-electron noise by averaging several independent measurements of one single event. During the repetitive readout collected electrons are transferred between two readout nodes within each pixel to enable electron number-resolved measurements. The pixels serve as a unit cell of an active pixel sensor to achieve a high level of parallelization and fast readout. These properties are exploited in the DANAE experiment, which aims for the direct detection of light dark matter based with the event signature of electron recoils. We present the experimental characterization of an $64\times64$ RNDR-DEPFET pixel detector with a focus on the charge carrier generation rate. This technology achieves a high time resolution, which increases its sensitivity on rare events with a signal of two or more electrons due to the Poisson distribution of thermal generated electrons.</description>

      <title>Development of a Low-Cost, Autonomous Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Chlorophyll Fluorometer for In-Situ Monitoring of Photosystem II Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum yield efficiency of photosystem II (PhiPSII) is an important parameter for assessing the photosynthetic performance and stress status of plants. Commercial PAM fluorometers can measure this parameter, but they are often expensive, bulky, or lack autonomous operation. This work presents the development of an autonomous PAM fluorometer designed to address these limitations and enable large-scale deployment. It supports high spatio-temporal monitoring of PhiPSII in forest canopies under a wide range of ambient light conditions.
  The prototype costs approximately 150 EUR, has dimensions of 3 cm x 6 cm x 2 cm, and weighs about 50 g. In side-by-side tests across three plant species, it achieved measurement accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art commercial sensors, with a correlation factor of R^2 = 0.95.</description>

      <title>Variable-temperature attenuator calibration method for on-wafer microwave noise characterization of low-noise amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-noise cryogenic microwave amplifiers are widely used in applications such as radio astronomy and quantum computing. On-wafer noise characterization of cryogenic low-noise transistors is desirable because it facilitates more rapid characterization of devices prior to packaging, but obtaining accurate noise measurements is difficult due to the uncertainty arising from the input loss and temperature gradients prior to the device-under-test (DUT). Here, we report a calibration method that enables the simultaneous determination of the backend noise temperature and effective-noise-ratio at the input plane of the DUT. The method is based on measuring the S-parameters and noise power of a series of attenuators at two or more distinct physical temperatures. We validate our method by measuring the noise temperature of InP HEMTs in 4-8 GHz. The calibration method can be generalized to measure the microwave noise temperature of any two-port device so long as a series of attenuators can be measured at two or more distinct physical temperatures.</description>

      <title>Exploring the production of Terbium-161 in the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) was conceived to meet national needs for radioisotope production, materials irradiation testing, and neutron beam applications. In addition to its 30~MW pool-type reactor, the RMB complex will include additional facilities for radioisotope production and related applications. $^{161}Tb$ is a promising radionuclide for radiopharmaceutical therapy, offering decay properties similar to $^{177}Lu$ but with additional conversion and Auger electrons that enhance dose delivery to cancer cells. In light of this emerging radioisotope, this study explores the potential production of $^{161}Tb$ in the RMB through neutron irradiation of enriched $Gd_{2}O_{3}$ targets. Monte Carlo (MCNP) simulations provided detailed neutron flux distributions, which were used as input for ORIGEN calculations of isotope buildup. Assuming 10 mg targets enriched to 97.5% in $^{160}Gd$, a 40-day irradiation, and a thermal flux of $2 \cdot 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$, the results indicate that $^{161}Tb$ activity reaches approximately 4.5 GBq after 14 days ($\approx 450 GBq/g$), in agreement with data from other research reactors. Building on prior studies that demonstrated the RMB's capability to irradiate larger targets, terabecquerel-scale yields appear feasible. These findings highlight the RMB's potential to support domestic production of emerging therapeutic radionuclides such as $^{161}Tb$. The potential for isotopic enrichment of $^{160}Gd$ using the AVLIS method is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Electron Recoil via Sample Momentum Transfer under Optical Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between free electrons and optical modes underlies a variety of quantum and nanoscale light-matter phenomena, yet the associated momentum exchange with the sample largely remained overlooked. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the momentum transfer from free electrons to planar samples during optical mode excitation using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The momentum transfer to the sample modifies the apparent dispersion relation which is significant when the planner sample is tilted. Under specific conditions, the sample receives momentum opposite to the electron beam direction.</description>

      <title>NuBench: An Open Benchmark for Deep Learning-Based Event Reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.
  We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation.</description>

      <title>Machine learning inspired photon number resolution in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-number resolved detection with superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) attracts increasing interest, but lacks a systematic framework for interpreting and benchmarking this capability. In this work, we combine principal component analysis (PCA) with a new readout technique to explore the photon-number resolving capabilities of SNSPDs and find that the information of the photon number is contained in a single principal component which approximates the time derivative of the average response trace. We introduce a new confidence metric based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient to quantify the photon-number-resolving capabilities of a detector system and show that this metric can be used to compare different systems. Our analysis and interpretation of the principal components imply that photon-number resolution in SNSPDs can be achieved with moderate hardware requirements in terms of both sample rate (5 GSample/sec) and analog bandwidth (3 GHz) and could be implemented in an FPGA, giving a highly scalable solution for real-time photon counting.</description>

      <title>New results from fast timing iLGAD sensor on Timepix4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) the number of collisions per bunch crossing increases. To cope with these high rates in the pixel trackers, per-pixel time measurements are required, which implies the need for fast sensors. The inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) is one of the fast sensor options that is being investigated. This paper will show the results of an inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) with a pitch of 55 $\mu$m, a thickness of 250~$\mu$m and a large-area (2~cm$^2$), bump bonded to a Timepix4 ASIC. Timepix4 has 195~ps time binning on each pixel and therefore an excellent ASIC to test the sensor. The sensor is characterised with radio-active source measurements in the lab, and during beam test at the CERN SPS North Area H8 beamline, where the Timepix4 telescope was used. The telescope has a time reference of 12~ps and a pointing resolution of 2.4 $\pm$ 0.1~$\mu$m. The iLGAD shows an almost uniform gain of approximately 4 and an efficiency of 99.6 $\pm$ 0.1\%. Without any corrections the obtained time resolution is about 750~ps. After timewalk and clock corrections the time resolution becomes 377 $\pm$ 7~ps. Grazing angle measurements have been done, which allow to measure the time resolution as function of depth of the charge deposition in the sensor. This provides more insight for the perpendicular time resolution.</description>

      <title>Edge Machine Learning for Cluster Counting in Next-Generation Drift Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drift chambers have long been central to collider tracking, but future machines like a Higgs factory motivate higher granularity and cluster counting for particle ID, posing new data processing challenges. Machine learning (ML) at the "edge", or in cell-level readout, can dramatically reduce the off-detector data rate for high-granularity drift chambers by performing cluster counting at-source. We present machine learning algorithms for cluster counting in real-time readout of future drift chambers. These algorithms outperform traditional derivative-based techniques based on achievable pion-kaon separation. When synthesized to FPGA resources, they can achieve latencies consistent with real-time operation in a future Higgs factory scenario, thus advancing both R&amp;D for future collider detectors as well as hardware-based ML for edge applications in high energy physics.</description>

      <title>AstroECP: towards more practical Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based technique that enables bulk-sample characterization of crystallographic defects (e.g. dislocations, stacking faults, low angle boundaries). Despite its potential, ECCI remains underused for quantitative defect analysis as compared to transmission electron microscope (TEM) based methods. Here, we overcome barriers that limit the use of ECCI including optimizing signal-to-noise contrast, precise determination of the incident beam vector with calibrated and easy to use simulations and experimental selected area electron channeling patterns (SA-ECP). We introduce a systematic ECCI workflow, alongside a new open-source software tool (AstroECP), that includes calibration of stage tilting, SA-ECP field of view, and the energy that forms the ECP/ECCI contrast using dynamical simulations. The functionality of this workflow is demonstrated with case studies that include threading dislocations in GaAs and the cross validation of precession based ECCI-contrast, which is otherwise known as Electron Channeling Orientation Determination (eCHORD). To assist the reader, we also provide best practice guidelines for ECCI implementation to promote high-resolution defect imaging in the SEM.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5 x 10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in very low and low lunar orbits (vLLO/LLO), in elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs), at the Earth-Moon L1 point, and in near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are sufficient to achieve 5 x 10^{-18} fractional stability for deep cislunar regimes (e.g., NRHO, Earth-Moon L1), supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation; near-surface and vLLO realizations generally require a much higher spherical-harmonic degree, l_max &gt;= 300, to meet the same stability goal. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.</description>

      <title>Observation of Rayleigh optical activity for chiral molecules: a new chiroptical tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By measuring a small circularly polarized component in the scattered light, we report the first observation of Rayleigh optical activity (RayOA) for isotropic samples of chiral molecules, namely the two enantiomers of $\alpha$-pinene in neat liquid form. Our work validates fundamental theoretical predictions made over fifty years ago and expands the chiroptical toolkit.</description>
