      <title>Global well-posedness and scattering for the defocusing septic one-dimensional NLS via new smoothing and almost Morawetz estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the one dimensional septic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is globally well-posed and scatters in $H^s (\mathbb{R})$ when $s &gt; 19/54$. We prove new smoothing estimates on the nonlinear Duhamel part of the solution and utilize a linear-nonlinear decomposition to take advantage of the gained regularity. We also prove new $L^{p+3}_{t,x}$ almost Morawetz estimates for the defocusing $p-$NLS adapted to the low-regularity setting, before specializing to the septic case $p=7$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport Using Cost Functions with Preferential Direction with Applications to Optics Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on Optimal Transport PDE on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ with a particular type of cost function $c(x,y) = F(x \cdot y, x \cdot \hat{e}, y \cdot \hat{e})$ which we call cost functions with preferential direction, where $\hat{e} \in \mathbb{S}^2$. This type of cost function arises in an optics application which we call the point-to-point reflector problem. We define basic hypotheses on the cost functions with preferential direction that will allow for the Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) conditions to hold and construct a regularity theory for such cost functions. For the point-to-point reflector problem, we show that the negative cost-sectional curvature condition does not hold. We will nevertheless prove the existence of a unique solution of the point-to-point reflector problem, up to a constant, provided that the source and target intensity are "close enough".</description>

      <title>On a 3D Stokes eigenvalue problem under Navier slip-with-friction boundary conditions and applications to Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider, by means of a precise spectral analysis, the 3D Navier-Stokes equations endowed with Navier slip-with-friction boundary conditions. We study the problem in a very simple geometric situation as the region between two parallel planes, with periodicity along the two planes. This setting, which is often used in the theory of boundary layers, requires some special treatment for what concerns the functional setting and allows us to characterize in a rather explicit manner eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the associated Stokes problem. These, will be then used in order to identify infinite dimensional classes of data leading to global strong solutions for the corresponding evolution Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity for solutions to an orthotropic $q$-Laplacian-type equation in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the local Lipschitz regularity for solutions to an orthotropic $q$ Laplacian-type equation in the Heisenberg group. The technique we apply is largely inspired by the works of X. Zhong, where the $q$-Laplacian was studied in the Heinsenberg group and the H\"older regularity of gradient was proved. Due to the degeneracy of the present equation, this regularity of the gradient is not even known in the Euclidean setting, and only its boundedness is expected.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a fairly large class of boundary conditions for the linearised Einstein equations in the Riemannian setting, ones which generalise the linearised counterpart of boundary conditions proposed by Anderson. Through the prism of the quest to quantise gravitational waves in curved spacetimes, we study their properties from the point of view of ellipticity, gauge invariance, and the existence of a spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Pointwise and Oscillation Estimates via Riesz Potentials for Mixed Local and Nonlocal Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a class of pointwise estimates for weak solutions to mixed local and nonlocal parabolic equations involving measure data and merely measurable coefficients via caloric Riesz potentials. Such estimates effectively bound the sizes and oscillations of weak solutions, respectively. The proof relies on demonstrating a new local H\"{o}lder estimate with an optimal $L^q$-Tail for weak solutions to the corresponding homogeneous problem, which remarkably extends the $L^\infty$-Tail in previous work. It is worth mentioning that our main results capture both local and nonlocal features of the double phase parabolic equations and, more importantly, remain valid for SOLA (Solutions Obtained by Limit of Approximations).</description>

      <title>On Landau equation with harmonic potential: nonlinear stability of time-periodic Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first and rigorous confirmations of the hypotheses by Ludwig Boltzmann in his seminal paper \cite{Boltzmann} within the context of the Landau equation in the presence of a harmonic potential. We prove that (i) Each {\it entropy-invariant solution} can be identified as a {\it time-periodic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution}. Moreover, these distributions can be characterized by thirteen conservation laws, which sheds light on the global dynamics. (ii) Each {\it time-periodic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution} is nonlinearly stable, including neutral asymptotic stability and Lyapunov stability. Furthermore, the convergence rate is entirely reliant on the thirteen conservation laws and is optimal when compared to the linear scenario.</description>

      <title>Viscosity estimation for 2D pipe flows I. Construction, consistency, asymptotic normality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the motion of incompressible viscous fluid in a rectangle, imposing the periodicity condition in one direction and the no-slip boundary condition in the other. Assuming that the flow is subject to an external random force, white in time and regular in space, we construct an estimator for the viscosity using only observations of the enstrophy. The goal of the paper is to prove that the estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. The proof of consistency is based on the explicit formula for the estimator and some bounds for trajectories, while that of asymptotic normality uses in addition mixing properties of the Navier-Stokes flow.</description>

      <title>Bilinear optimal control for chemotaxis model: The case of two-sidedly degenerate diffusion with Volume-Filling Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal control problem for a coupled non-linear system of reaction-diffusion equations with degenerate diffusion, consisting of two partial differential equations representing the density of cells and the concentration of the chemotactic agent. By controlling the concentration of the chemical substrates, this study can guide the optimal growth of cells. The novelty of this work lies on the direct and dual models that remain in a weak setting, which is uncommon in the recent literature for solving optimal control systems. Moreover, it is known that the adjoint problems offer a powerful approach to quantifying the uncertainty associated with model inputs. However, these systems typically lack closed-form solutions, making it challenging to obtain weak solutions. For that, the well-posedness of the direct problem is first well guaranteed. Then, the existence of an optimal control and the first-order optimality conditions are established. Finally, weak solutions for the adjoint system to the non-linear degenerate direct model, are introduced and investigated.</description>

      <title>Shocks and instability in Brownian last-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi (SHJ) equations, instability points are the space-time locations where two eternal solutions with the same asymptotic velocity differ. Another crucial structure in such equations is shocks, which are the space-time locations where the velocity field is discontinuous. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the structure and relationships between shocks, instability, and competition interfaces in the Brownian last-passage percolation model, which serves as a prototype of a semi-discrete inviscid stochastic HJ equation in one space dimension. Among our findings, we show that the shock trees of the two unstable eternal solutions differ within the instability region and align outside of it. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one can reconstruct a skeleton of the instability region from these two shock trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.03610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytic FBI transform is built on compact manifolds without boundary, that satisfies all the expected properties. It enables the study of microlocal analytic and Gevrey regularity on such manifolds. This tool is then used to study the Ruelle spectrum of Anosov flows with Gevrey coefficients. In particular, finite order for the associated dynamical determinant is proved.</description>

Abstract: We study linear inhomogeneous kinetic equations with an external confining potential and a collision operator admitting several local conservation laws (local density, momentum and energy). We classify all special macroscopic modes (stationary solutions and time-periodic solutions). We also prove the convergence of all solutions of the evolution equation to such non-trivial modes, with a quantitative exponential rate. This is the first hypocoercivity result with multiple special macroscopic modes with constructive estimates depending on the geometry of the potential.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the spectral function on Zoll manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a Zoll manifold, i.e., a smooth, compact, Riemannian manifold without boundary all of whose geodesics are closed with a minimal common period $T$. The positive definite Laplace-Beltrami operator has eigenvalues $\{\lambda_j^2\}_j$ which cluster around $\nu^2_\ell$ for some sequence $\nu_\ell\to \infty$. This article is concerned with the number of $\lambda_j$ in a window of fixed size $\mathrm{w}$ around $\nu_\ell$, denoted by $\mathbf{N}(\nu_\ell,\mathrm{w}):=\#\{j\,:\, \lambda_j\in[\nu_\ell-\mathrm{w},\nu_\ell+\mathrm{w}]\}.$ When the set of trajectories with period smaller than $T$ has zero measure, there is $c_{n}&gt;0$, depending only on $n=\operatorname{dim} M$, such that $$ \mathbf{N}(\nu_\ell,\mathrm{w}) =c_n\operatorname{vol}_g(M)\nu_{\ell}^{n-1}+o(\nu_{\ell}^{n-1}), $$ as $\ell \to \infty$. However, for a general Zoll manifold this may not be the case. We show that, nevertheless, there is $N&gt;0$, independent of $\ell$, such that $$ \sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\mathbf{N}(\nu_{\ell+j},\mathrm{w})= c_nN\operatorname{vol}_g(M)\nu_{\ell}^{n-1}+o(\nu_{\ell}^{n-1}), $$ as $\ell \to \infty$. In addition to asymptotics for the counting function, we study the kernel of the spectral projector for the Laplacian, $\Pi_{\ell,\mathrm{w}}(x,y)$ onto the spectrum in ${\bigcup_{j=0}^{N-1}[\nu_{\ell+j}-\mathrm{w},\nu_{\ell+j}+\mathrm{w}]}$. We show that for $x$ and $y$ in a shrinking neighborhood of a point with few loops of length smaller than $T$, $\Pi_{\ell,\mathrm{w}}(x,y)$ and its derivatives have the same asymptotics as those on the round sphere and flat torus.</description>

      <title>Optimal decay and regularity for a Thomas--Fermi type variational problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study existence and qualitative properties of the minimizers for a Thomas--Fermi type energy functional defined by $$E_\alpha(\rho):=\frac{1}{q}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\rho(x)|^q dx+\frac{1}{2}\iint_{\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R}^d}\frac{\rho(x)\rho(y)}{|x-y|^{d-\alpha}}dx dy-\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}V(x)\rho(x)dx,$$ where $d\ge 2$, $\alpha\in (0,d)$ and $V$ is a potential. Under broad assumptions on $V$ we establish existence, uniqueness and qualitative properties such as positivity, regularity and decay at infinity of the global minimizer. The decay at infinity depends in a non--trivial way on the choice of $\alpha$ and $q$. If $\alpha\in (0,2)$ and $q&gt;2$ the global minimizer is proved to be positive under mild regularity assumptions on $V$, unlike in the local case $\alpha=2$ where the global minimizer has typically compact support. We also show that if $V$ decays sufficiently fast the global minimizer is sign--changing even if $V$ is non--negative. In such regimes we establish a relation between the positive part of the global minimizer and the support of the minimizer of the energy, constrained on the non--negative functions. Our study is motivated by recent models of charge screening in graphene, where sign--changing minimizers appear in a natural way.</description>

Abstract: We prove the stability of three-dimensional axisymmetric solutions to the steady Euler system with transonic shocks in divergent nozzles under perturbations of the exit pressure and the supersonic solution in the upstream region. We first derive a free boundary problem with the newly introduced formulation of the Euler system for three-dimensional axisymmetric flows in divergent nozzles via the method of Helmholtz decomposition. We then construct an iteration scheme and use the Schauder fixed point theorem and weak implicit function theorem to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Regularization estimates of the Landau-Coulomb diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau-Coulomb equation is an important model in plasma physics featuring both nonlinear diffusion and reaction terms. In this manuscript we focus on the diffusion operator within the equation by dropping the potentially nefarious reaction term altogether. We show that the diffusion operator in the Landau-Coulomb equation provides a much stronger L^1 to L^\infty rate of regularization than its linear counterpart, the Laplace operator. This stronger regularization rate illustrates the importance of the nonlinear nature of the diffusion in the analysis of the Landau equation and raises the question of determining whether this rate also happens for the Landau-Coulomb equation itself.</description>

      <title>The Maslov index, degenerate crossings and the stability of pulse solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the scalar Swift-Hohenberg equation with quadratic-cubic nonlinearity, it is known that symmetric pulse solutions exist for certain parameter regions. In this paper we develop a method to determine the spectral stability of these solutions. We first associate a Maslov index to each solution and then argue that this index coincides with the number of unstable eigenvalues for the linearized evolution equation. This requires extending the method of computing the Maslov index introduced by Robbin and Salamon to so-called degenerate crossings. We extend their formulation of the Maslov index to degenerate crossings of general order. Furthermore, we develop a numerical method to compute the Maslov index associated to symmetric pulse solutions. Finally, we consider several solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation and use our method to characterize their stability.</description>

      <title>Existence, Uniqueness and Asymptotic Dynamics of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations With Quasi-Periodic Initial Data: I. The Standard NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first part of a two-paper series studying nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with quasi-periodic initial data. In this paper, we consider the standard nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Under the assumption that the Fourier coefficients of the initial data obey a power-law upper bound, we establish local existence of a solution that retains quasi-periodicity in space with a slightly weaker Fourier decay. Moreover, the solution is shown to be unique within this class of quasi-periodic functions. In addition, for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with small nonlinearity, within the time scale, as the small parameter of nonlinearity tends to zero, we prove that the nonlinear solution converges asymptotically to the linear solution with respect to both the sup-norm $\|\cdot\|_{L_x^\infty(\mathbb R)}$ and the Sobolev-norm $\|\cdot\|_{H^s_x(\mathbb R)}$.
  The proof proceeds via a consideration of an associated infinite system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients and a combinatorial analysis of the resulting tree expansion of the coefficients. For this purpose, we introduce a Feynman diagram for the Picard iteration and $\ast^{[\cdot]}$ to denote the complex conjugate label.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of solutions to the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem associated with a class of doubly nonlinear anisotropic evolution equations. We also demonstrate the existence of solutions to the corresponding Cauchy problem on $\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,T)$. Under some assumptions on the Caratheodory vector field we prove a comparison principle and utilize it to obtain a uniqueness result for the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem.</description>

      <title>Regularity of a double null coordinate system for Kerr-Newman-de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a double null coordinate system $(u,v,\theta_\star,\phi_\star)$ for Kerr-Newman-de Sitter spacetimes and prove that the two-spheres given by the intersection of the hypersurfaces $u=\mbox{constant}$ and $v=\mbox{constant}$ are $C^\infty$ in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates (including at the "poles"). The null coordinates allow one to immediately extend some results previously proven for Kerr. As an example, we illustrate how Sbierski's result, for the wave equation on the black hole interior, for Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr spacetimes, applies to Kerr-Newman-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>On the Dirichlet problem at infinity on three-manifolds of negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that in a three-manifold with finitely many expansive ends, such that each end has a neighborhood where the curvature is bounded above by a negative constant, the Dirichlet problem at infinity is solvable, and hence that such manifolds posses a wealth of bounded non constant harmonic functions (and thus, Liouville's theorem does not hold). In the case of infinitely many expansive ends, we show that if each end has a neighborhood where the curvature is bounded above by a negative constant, then the Dirichlet problem at infinity is solvable for continuous boundary data at infinity which is uniformly bounded. Our method is based on a result that does not require explicit curvature assumptions, and hence it can be applied to other situations: we present an example of a metric on an end with curvature of indefinite sign (no matter how long we go along the end) for which the Dirichlet Problem at Infinity is solvable with respect to that end. We also present a related result in the case of surfaces with a pole which generalises a celebrated criteria of Milnor.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations of Many-Body Dynamics around the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of a gas of $N$ bosons in the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii regime (in which particles are initially trapped in a volume of order one and interact through a repulsive potential with scattering length of the order $1/N$). We construct a quasi-free approximation of the many-body dynamics, whose distance to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation converges to zero, as $N \to \infty$, in the $L^2 (\mathbb{R}^{3N})$-norm. To achieve this goal, we let the Bose-Einstein condensate evolve according to a time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. After factoring out the microscopic correlation structure, the evolution of the orthogonal excitations of the condensate is governed instead by a Bogoliubov dynamics, with a time-dependent generator quadratic in creation and annihilation operators. As an application, we show a central limit theorem for fluctuations of bounded observables around their expectation with respect to the Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>
