      <title>Deep-OFDM: Neural Modulation for High Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the foundational waveform in current 5G deployments due to its robustness in quasi-static channels and efficient spectrum use. However, in high-mobility scenarios, OFDM suffers from inter-carrier interference (ICI), and its reliance on dense pilot patterns and cyclic prefixes significantly reduces spectral efficiency. In this work, we propose Deep-OFDM: a learnable modulation framework that augments traditional OFDM by incorporating neural parameterization. Instead of mapping each symbol to a fixed resource element, Deep-OFDM spreads information across the OFDM grid using a convolutional neural network modulator. This modulator is jointly optimized with a neural receiver through end-to-end training, enabling the system to adapt to time-varying channels without relying on explicit channel estimation. Deep-OFDM outperforms conventional OFDM when paired with neural receiver baselines, particularly in pilot-sparse and pilotless regimes, achieving substantial gains in BLER and goodput, especially at high Doppler frequencies. In the pilotless setting, the neural modulator learns a low-rank structure that resembles a superimposed pilot, effectively enabling reliable communication without explicit overhead. Deep-OFDM demonstrates significant improvements in BLER and goodput at high Doppler frequencies across various scenarios, including MIMO systems. Comprehensive ablation studies quantify the role of nonlinear activations and characterize performance-complexity trade-offs. These results highlight the potential of transmitter-receiver co-design for robust, resource-efficient communication, paving the way for AI-native physical layer designs in next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmission for Cellular Networks with Pinching Antennas: System Design and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging flexible antenna technology for wireless communications, pinching-antenna systems, offer distinct advantages in terms of cost efficiency and deployment flexibility. This paper investigates joint transmission strategies of the base station (BS) and pinching antennas (PAS), focusing specifically on how to cooperate efficiently between the BS and waveguide-mounted pinching antennas for enhancing the performance of the user equipment (UE). By jointly considering the performance, flexibility, and complexity, we propose three joint BS-PAS transmission schemes along with the best beamforming designs, namely standalone deployment (SD), semi-cooperative deployment (SCD) and full-cooperative deployment (FCD). More specifically, for each BS-PAS joint transmission scheme, we conduct a comprehensive performance analysis in terms of the power allocation strategy, beamforming design, and practical implementation considerations. We also derive closed-form expressions for the average received SNR across the proposed BS-PAS joint transmission schemes, which are verified through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that deploying pinching antennas in cellular networks, particularly through cooperation between the BS and PAS, can achieve significant performance gains. We further identify and characterize the key network parameters that influence the performance, providing insights for deploying pinching antennas.</description>

      <title>Signal Recovery on Algebraic Varieties Using Linear Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recovery of an unknown signal from its linear measurements is a fundamental problem spanning numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. Commonly, prior knowledge suggests that the underlying signal resides within a known algebraic variety. This context naturally leads to a question: what is the minimum number of measurements required to uniquely recover any signal belonging to such an algebraic variety? In this survey paper, we introduce a method that leverages tools from algebraic geometry to address this question. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to two problems: phase retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery. %Furthermore, this paper bridges abstract algebraic concepts with concrete signal processing. We also highlight several open problems, which could serve as a basis for future investigations in this field.</description>

      <title>Quantizing for Noisy Flash Memory Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flash memory-based processing-in-memory (flash-based PIM) offers high storage capacity and computational efficiency but faces significant reliability challenges due to noise in high-density multi-level cell (MLC) flash memories. Existing verify level optimization methods are designed for general storage scenarios and fail to address the unique requirements of flash-based PIM systems, where metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are critical. This paper introduces an integrated framework that jointly optimizes quantization and verify levels to minimize the MSE, considering both quantization and flash memory channel errors. We develop an iterative algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem. Experimental results on quantized images and SwinIR model parameters stored in flash memory show that the proposed method significantly improves the reliability of flash-based PIM systems.</description>

      <title>Virtual Teleportation of CSIT via Non-Signaling Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-signaling correlations, which (strictly) include quantum correlations, provide a tractable path to explore the potential impact of quantum nonlocality on the capacity of classical communication networks. Motivated by a recent discovery that certain wireless network settings benefit significantly from non-signaling (NS) correlations, various generalizations are considered. First, it is shown that for a point to point discrete memoryless channel with a non-causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the NS-assisted Shannon capacity matches the classical (without NS assistance) capacity of the channel for the setting where the state is also made available to the receiver. The key insight is summarized as 'virtual teleportation of CSIT via NS-assistance' and is supported by further results as follows. For a discrete memoryless 2-user broadcast channel (BC), the Shannon capacity region with NS-assistance available only between the transmitter and User 1, is found next. Consistent with the aforementioned key insight, the result matches the classical capacity region for the setting where the desired message of User 2 is made available in advance as side-information to User 1. The latter capacity region is known from a result of Kramer and Shamai. Next, for a semi-deterministic BC, the Shannon capacity region with full (tripartite) NS-assistance is shown to be the same as if only bipartite NS-assistance was available between the transmitter and the non-deterministic user. Bipartite NS-assistance between the transmitter and only the deterministic user, does not improve the capacity region relative to the corresponding classical setting. Finally, the analysis is extended to a K-user BC with full NS-assistance among all parties.</description>

      <title>Robust Energy-Efficient DRL-Based Optimization in UAV-Mounted RIS Systems with Jitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an energy-efficient design for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) communication system with nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) and UAV jitter. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the EH efficiency of the UAV-mounted RIS by controlling the user powers, RIS phase shifts, and time-switching factor, subject to quality of service and practical EH constraints. The problem is nonconvex and time-coupled due to UAV angular jitter and nonlinear EH dynamics, making it intractable for conventional optimization methods. To address this, we reformulate the problem as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) environment and develop a smoothed softmax dual deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The proposed method incorporates action clipping, entropy regularization, and softmax-weighted Q-value estimation to improve learning stability and exploration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges reliably under various UAV jitter levels and achieves an average EH efficiency of 45.07\%, approaching the 53.09\% upper bound of exhaustive search, and outperforming other DRL baselines.</description>

      <title>Frequency Range 3 for ISAC in 6G: Potentials and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spanning 7-24 GHz, frequency range 3 (FR3), is a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks by bridging the coverage of sub-6 GHz and the capacity of millimeter-wave bands. Its unique propagation characteristics, such as extended near-field regions and spatially nonstationary fading, enable new transmission strategies. This article explores the potential of FR3 for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which unifies wireless communication and environmental sensing. We show that FR3's bandwidth and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) capabilities enable high-resolution sensing, multi-target tracking, and fast data transmission. We emphasize the importance of ultra-massive MIMO with extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) and the need for unified near-field and far-field channel models to support efficient ISAC. Finally, we outline challenges and future research directions for ELAA-based ISAC in 6G FR3.</description>

      <title>Rack-Aware MSR Codes with Linear Field Size and Smaller Sub-Packetization for Tolerating Multiple Erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an $(n,k,d)$ rack-aware storage model, the system consists of $n$ nodes uniformly distributed across $\bar{n}$ successive racks, such that each rack contains $u$ nodes of equal capacity and the reconstructive degree satisfies $k=\bar{k}u+v$ where $0\leq v\leq u-1$. Suppose there are $h\geq1$ failed nodes in a rack (called the host rack). Then together with its surviving nodes, the host rack downloads recovery data from $\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its failed nodes. In this paper, we focus on studying the rack-aware minimum storage generating (MSR) codes for repairing $h$ failed nodes within the same rack. By using the coupled-layer construction with the alignment technique, we construct the first class of rack-aware MSR codes for all $\bar{k}+1\leq\bar{d}\leq\bar{n}-1$ which achieve the small sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/\bar{s}\rceil}$ where the field size $q$ increases linearly with $n$ and $\bar{s}=\bar{d}-\bar{k}+1$. In addition, these codes achieve optimal repair bandwidth for $1\leq h\leq u-v$, and asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth for $u-v+1\leq h\leq u$. In particular, they achieve optimal access when $h=u-v$. It is worth noting that the existing rack-aware MSR codes which achieve the same sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/\bar{s}\rceil}$ are only known for the special case of $\bar{d}=\bar{n}-1$, $h=1$, and the field size is much larger than ours. Then, based on our first construction we further develop another class of explicit rack-aware MSR codes with even smaller sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/(\bar{s}+1)\rceil}$ for all admissible values of $\bar{d}$.</description>

      <title>$(\ell,\delta)$-Diversity: Linkage-Robustness via a Composition Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18405v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of degradation of anonymity upon linkages of anonymized datasets. We work in the setting where an adversary links together $t\geq 2$ anonymized datasets in which a user of interest participates, based on the user's known quasi-identifiers, which motivates the use of $\ell$-diversity as the notion of dataset anonymity. We first argue that in the worst case, such linkage attacks can reveal the exact sensitive attribute of the user, even when each dataset respects $\ell$-diversity, for moderately large values of $\ell$. This issue motivates our definition of (approximate) $(\ell,\delta)$-diversity -- a parallel of (approximate) $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) -- which simply requires that a dataset respect $\ell$-diversity, with high probability. We then present a mechanism for achieving $(\ell,\delta)$-diversity, in the setting of independent and identically distributed samples. Next, we establish bounds on the degradation of $(\ell,\delta)$-diversity, via a simple ``composition theorem,'' similar in spirit to those in the DP literature, thereby showing that approximate diversity, unlike standard diversity, is roughly preserved upon linkage. Finally, we describe simple algorithms for maximizing utility, measured in terms of the number of anonymized ``equivalence classes,'' and derive explicit lower bounds on the utility, for special sample distributions.</description>

      <title>Multi-user Downlink with Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is a transformative technology with great potential in many applications in wireless communications and realizing the Internet of Everything at sixth generation (6G). In this study, we propose a wireless system where the RIS acts as an antenna, which we call Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA). In particular, the base station (BS) equipped with a RIMSA array performs downlink transmissions to multiple users, where each user has a single or multiple RIMSA/RF links, and we aim to solve the sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the digital processing matrix of the transceivers and the phase responses of RIMSA array at both BS and users. For the multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenario, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm to slove the problem, where a fractional programming (FP) is used to optimize the digital processing matrix and a product manifold optimization (PMO) is proposed to provide the optimal phase responses of the RIMSA array at both BS and users. For the multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenario, we equate it to a weighted sum of mean square errors minimization problem, which can be solved by three subproblems iteratively. Both the optimal digital precoder subproblem and the optimal digital combiner subproblem have closed-form solutions, and the subproblem of RIMSA configuration is solved by the PMO algorithm as well. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve significant performance gains over conventional algorithms.</description>

      <title>A scalable estimator of high-order information in complex dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of neural systems rests on our ability to characterise how they perform distributed computation and integrate information. Advances in information theory have introduced several quantities to describe complex information structures, where collective patterns of coordination emerge from high-order (i.e. beyond-pairwise) interdependencies. Unfortunately, the use of these approaches to study large neural systems is severely hindered by the poor scalability of existing techniques. Moreover, there are relatively few measures specifically designed for multivariate time series data. Here we introduce a novel measure of information about macroscopic structures, termed M-information, which quantifies the high-order integration of information in complex dynamical systems. We show that M-information can be calculated via a convex optimisation problem, and we derive a robust and efficient algorithm that scales gracefully with system size. Our analyses show that M-information is resilient to noise, indexes critical behaviour in artificial neuronal populations, and reflects task performance in real-world mouse brain activity data. Furthermore, M-information can be incorporated into existing information decomposition frameworks to reveal a comprehensive taxonomy of information dynamics. Taken together, these results help us unravel collective computation in complex neural systems.</description>

      <title>A Simple but Accurate Approximation for Multivariate Gaussian Rate-Distortion Function and Its Application in Maximal Coding Rate Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multivariate Gaussian rate-distortion (RD) function is crucial in various applications, such as digital communications, data storage, or neural networks. However, the complex form of the multivariate Gaussian RD function prevents its application in many neural network-based scenarios that rely on its analytical properties, for example, white-box neural networks, multi-device task-oriented communication, and semantic communication. This paper proposes a simple but accurate approximation for the multivariate Gaussian RD function. The upper and lower bounds on the approximation error (the difference between the approximate and the exact value) are derived, which indicate that for well-conditioned covariance matrices, the approximation error is small. In particular, when the condition number of the covariance matrix approaches 1, the approximation error approaches 0. In addition, based on the proposed approximation, a new classification algorithm called Adaptive Regularized ReduNet (AR-ReduNet) is derived by applying the approximation to ReduNet, which is a white-box classification network oriented from Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR$^2$) principle. Simulation results indicate that AR-ReduNet achieves higher accuracy and more efficient optimization than ReduNet.</description>

      <title>Explicit Constructions of Sum-Rank Metric Codes from Quadratic Kummer Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents new constructions of sum-rank metric codes derived from algebraic function fields, while the existing results about such codes remain limited. A central challenge in this field involves the determination of parameters. We address this challenge through quadratic Kummer extensions, and propose two general constructions of $2\times2$ sum-rank codes. The novel sum-rank metric code constructions derived from algebraic function fields demonstrate superior code lengths compared to conventional coding paradigms, particularly when contrasted with linearized Reed-Solomon codes under equivalent code parameter constraints. We also establish explicit parameters including dimensions and minimum distances of our codes. Finally, an illustrative example through elliptic function fields is constructed for validating the theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite Programming for the Asymmetric Stochastic Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider semidefinite programming (SDP) for the binary stochastic block model with equal-sized communities. Prior work of Hajek, Wu, and Xu proposed an SDP (sym-SDP) for the symmetric case where the intra-community edge probabilities are equal, and showed that the SDP achieves the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery under the symmetry assumption. A key open question is whether SDPs can be used to achieve exact recovery for non-symmetric block models. In order to inform the design of a new SDP for the non-symmetric setting, we investigate the failure of sym-SDP when it is applied to non-symmetric settings. We formally show that sym-SDP fails to return the correct labeling of the vertices in some information-theoretically feasible, asymmetric cases. In addition, we give an intuitive geometric interpretation of the failure of sym-SDP in asymmetric settings, which in turn suggests an SDP formulation to handle the asymmetric setting. Still, this new SDP cannot be readily analyzed by existing techniques, suggesting a fundamental limitation in the design of SDPs for community detection.</description>

      <title>Oblivious Deletion Codes</title>

Abstract: We construct deletion error-correcting codes in the oblivious model, where errors are adversarial but oblivious to the encoder's randomness. Oblivious errors bridge the gap between the adversarial and random error models, and are motivated by applications like DNA storage, where the noise is caused by hard-to-model physical phenomena, but not by an adversary.
  (1) (Explicit oblivious) We construct $t$ oblivious deletion codes, with redundancy $\sim 2t\log n$, matching the existential bound for adversarial deletions.
  (2) (List decoding implies explicit oblivious) We show that explicit list-decodable codes yield explicit oblivious deletion codes with essentially the same parameters. By a work of Guruswami and H\r{a}stad (IEEE TIT, 2021), this gives 2 oblivious deletion codes with redundancy $\sim 3\log n$, beating the existential redundancy for 2 adversarial deletions.
  (3) (Randomized oblivious) We give a randomized construction of oblivious codes that, with probability at least $1-2^{-n}$, produces a code correcting $t$ oblivious deletions with redundancy $\sim(t+1)\log n$, beating the existential adversarial redundancy of $\sim 2t\log n$.
  (4) (Randomized adversarial) Studying the oblivious model can inform better constructions of adversarial codes. The same technique produces, with probability at least $1-2^{-n}$, a code correcting $t$ adversarial deletions with redundancy $\sim (2t+1)\log n$, nearly matching the existential redundancy of $\sim 2t\log n$.
  The common idea behind these results is to reduce the hash size by modding by a prime chosen (randomly) from a small subset, and including a small encoding of the prime in the hash.</description>

      <title>Learning Partitions with Optimal Query and Round Complexities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning an unknown partition of $n$ elements into at most $k$ sets using simple queries that reveal information about a small subset of elements. Our starting point is the well-studied pairwise same-set queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same class. It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(n^2)$ queries, while adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known algorithm uses $k-1$ rounds. This problem has been studied extensively over the last two decades in multiple communities due to its fundamental nature and relevance to clustering, active learning, and crowd sourcing. In many applications, it is of high interest to reduce adaptivity while minimizing query complexity. We give a complete characterization of the deterministic query complexity of this problem as a function of the number of rounds, $r$, interpolating between the non-adaptive and adaptive settings: for any constant $r$, the query complexity is $\Theta(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^r-1}}k^{1-\frac{1}{2^r-1}})$. Our algorithm only needs $O(\log \log n)$ rounds to attain the optimal $O(nk)$ query complexity.
  Next, we consider two generalizations of pairwise queries to subsets $S$ of size at most $s$: (1) weak subset queries which return the number of classes intersected by $S$, and (2) strong subset queries which return the entire partition restricted on $S$. Once again in crowd sourcing applications, queries on large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show $\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that there is a non-adaptive algorithm using weak queries that matches this bound up to log-factors for all $s \leq \sqrt{n}$. More generally, we obtain nearly matching upper and lower bounds for algorithms using subset queries in terms of both the number of rounds, $r$, and the query size bound, $s$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph reconstruction problem has been extensively studied under various query models. In this paper, we propose a new query model regarding the number of connected components, which is one of the most basic and fundamental graph parameters. Formally, we consider the problem of reconstructing an $n$-node $m$-edge graph with oracle queries of the following form: provided with a subset of vertices, the oracle returns the number of connected components in the induced subgraph. We show $\Theta(\frac{m \log n}{\log m})$ queries in expectation are both sufficient and necessary to adaptively reconstruct the graph. In contrast, we show that $\Omega(n^2)$ non-adaptive queries are required, even when $m = O(n)$. We also provide an $O(m\log n + n\log^2 n)$ query algorithm using only two rounds of adaptivity.</description>

      <title>Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes, a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to $p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE); however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables $(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems, $q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.</description>

      <title>ISAC Network Planning: Sensing Coverage Analysis and 3-D BS Deployment Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks strive to deliver both high-precision target localization and high-throughput data services across the entire coverage area. In this work, we examine the fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication from the perspective of base station (BS) deployment. Furthermore, we conceive a design that simultaneously maximizes the target localization coverage, while guaranteeing the desired communication performance. In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an effective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy throughout the entire service area. While employing time-of-flight (ToF) based localization, we first analyze the deployment problem from a localization-performance coverage perspective, aiming for minimizing the area Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (A-CRLB) to ensure uniformly high positioning accuracy across the service area. We prove that for a fixed number of BSs, uniformly scaling the service area by a factor \kappa increases the optimal A-CRLB in proportion to \kappa^{2\beta}, where \beta is the BS-to-target pathloss exponent. Based on this, we derive an approximate scaling law that links the achievable A-CRLB across the area of interest to the dimensionality of the sensing area. We also show that cooperative BSs extends the coverage but yields marginal A-CRLB improvement as the dimensionality of the sensing area grows.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Bistatic ISAC Systems for Low-Altitude Economy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning low-altitude economy (LAE) necessitates integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems capable of high-accuracy multi-target localization and velocity estimation under hardware and coverage constraints inherent in conventional ISAC architectures. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a cooperative bistatic ISAC framework within MIMO-OFDM cellular networks, enabling robust sensing services for LAE applications through standardized 5G New Radio (NR) infrastructure. We first develop a low-complexity parameter extraction algorithm employing CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition, which exploits the inherent Vandermonde structure in delay-related factor matrices to efficiently recover bistatic ranges, Doppler velocities, and angles-of-arrival (AoA) from multi-dimensional received signal tensors. To resolve data association ambiguity across distributed transmitter-receiver pairs and mitigate erroneous estimates, we further design a robust fusion scheme based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) method, enabling joint 3D position and velocity reconstruction. Comprehensive simulation results validate the framework's superiority in computational efficiency and sensing performance for low-altitude scenarios.</description>

      <title>Six Decades Post-Discovery of Taylor's Power Law: From Ecological and Statistical Universality, Through Prime Number Distributions and Tipping-Point Signals, to Heterogeneity and Stability of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First discovered by L. R. Taylor (1961, Nature), Taylor's Power Law (TPL) correlates the mean (M) population abundances and the corresponding variances (V) across a set of insect populations using a power function (V=aM^b). TPL has demonstrated its 'universality' across numerous fields of sciences, social sciences, and humanities. This universality has inspired two main prongs of exploration: one from mathematicians and statisticians, who might instinctively respond with a convergence theorem similar to the central limit theorem of the Gaussian distribution, and another from biologists, ecologists, physicists, etc., who are more interested in potential underlying ecological or organizational mechanisms. Over the past six decades, TPL studies have produced a punctuated landscape with three relatively distinct periods (1960s-1980s; 1990s-2000s, and 2010s-2020s) across the two prongs of abstract and physical worlds. Eight themes have been identified and reviewed on this landscape, including population spatial aggregation and ecological mechanisms, TPL and skewed statistical distributions, mathematical/statistical mechanisms of TPL, sample vs. population TPL, population stability, synchrony, and early warning signals for tipping points, TPL on complex networks, TPL in macrobiomes, and in microbiomes. Three future research directions including fostering reciprocal interactions between the two prongs, heterogeneity measuring, and exploration in the context of evolution. The significance of TPL research includes practically, population fluctuations captured by TPL are relevant for agriculture, forestry, fishery, wildlife-conservation, epidemiology, tumor heterogeneity, earthquakes, social inequality, stock illiquidity, financial stability, tipping point events, etc.; theoretically, TPL is one form of power laws, which are related to phase transitions, universality, scale-invariance, etc.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretical limits of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms. Utilizing \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) we develop a generic program that allows statistical characterization of various algorithmic performance metrics. Through these we identify the concepts of \emph{parametric manifold} and its \emph{funneling points} as key mathematical objects that govern the underlying algorithms' behavior. An isomorphism between single funneling point manifolds and global convergence of descending algorithms is established. The structure and shape of the parametric manifold as well as its dependence on the sample complexity are studied through both plain and lifted RDT. Emergence of a phase transition is observed. Namely, as sample complexity increases, parametric manifold transitions from a multi to a single funneling point structure. This in return corresponds to a transition from the scenarios where descending algorithms generically fail to the scenarios where they succeed in solving phase retrieval. We also develop and implement a practical algorithmic variant that in a hybrid alternating fashion combines a barrier and a plain gradient descent. Even though the theoretical results are obtained for infinite dimensional scenarios (and consequently non-jittery parametric manifolds), we observe a strong agrement between theoretical and simulated phase transitions predictions for fairly small dimensions on the order of a few hundreds.</description>

      <title>Optimal spectral initializers impact on phase retrieval phase transitions -- an RDT view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the relation between spectral initializers and theoretical limits of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR). In companion paper [104], for any sample complexity ratio, $\alpha$, \emph{parametric manifold}, ${\mathcal {PM}}(\alpha)$, is recognized as a critically important structure that generically determines dPRs abilities to solve phase retrieval (PR). Moreover, overlap between the algorithmic solution and the true signal is positioned as a key ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s component. We here consider the so-called \emph{overlap optimal} spectral initializers (OptSpins) as dPR's starting points and develop a generic \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based program to statistically characterize them. In particular, we determine the functional structure of OptSpins and evaluate the starting overlaps that they provide for the dPRs. Since ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s so-called \emph{flat regions} are highly susceptible to \emph{local jitteriness} and as such are key obstacles on dPR's path towards PR's global optimum, a precise characterization of the starting overlap allows to determine if such regions can be successfully circumvented. Through the presented theoretical analysis we observe two key points in that regard: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} dPR's theoretical phase transition (critical $\alpha$ above which they solve PR) might be difficult to practically achieve as the ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s flat regions are large causing the associated OptSpins to fall exactly within them; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} Opting for so-called ``\emph{safer compression}'' and slightly increasing $\alpha$ (by say $15\%$) shrinks flat regions and allows OptSpins to fall outside them and dPRs to ultimately solve PR. Numerical simulations are conducted as well and shown to be in an excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Companion paper [118] developed a powerful \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based analytical program to statistically characterize performance of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR) (these include all variants of gradient descents and among them widely popular Wirtinger flows). We here generalize the program and show how it can be utilized to handle rank $d$ positive definite phase retrieval (PR) measurements (with special cases $d=1$ and $d=2$ serving as emulations of the real and complex phase retrievals, respectively). In particular, we observe that the minimal sample complexity ratio (number of measurements scaled by the dimension of the unknown signal) which ensures dPR's success exhibits a phase transition (PT) phenomenon. For both plain and lifted RDT we determine phase transitions locations. To complement theoretical results we implement a log barrier gradient descent variant and observe that, even in small dimensional scenarios (with problem sizes on the order of 100), the simulated phase transitions are in an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has shown significant potential to address complex optimization problems; however, its application remains confined to specific problems at limited scales. Spatial regionalization remains largely unexplored in quantum computing due to its complexity and large number of variables. In this paper, we introduce the first hybrid quantum-classical method to spatial regionalization by decomposing the problem into manageable subproblems, leveraging the strengths of both classical and quantum computation. This study establishes a foundational framework for effectively integrating quantum computing methods into realistic and complex spatial optimization tasks. Our initial results show a promising quantum performance advantage for a broad range of spatial regionalization problems and their variants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An interleaving sequence is obtained by combining or intertwining elements from two or more sequences. On the other hand, cellular automata are known to be generators for keystream sequences. In this paper we present two families of one-dimensional cellular automata as generators of interleaving sequences. This study aims to close a notable gap within the current body of literature by exploring the capacity of cellular automata to generate interleaving sequences. While previous works have separately examined cellular automata as sequence generators and interleaving sequences, there exists limited literature interconnecting these two topics. Our study seeks to bridge this gap, providing perspectives on the generation of interleaving sequences through the utilisation of cellular automata, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of both disciplines.</description>

      <title>Fast Rate Information-theoretic Bounds on Generalization Errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalization error of a learning algorithm refers to the discrepancy between the loss of a learning algorithm on training data and that on unseen testing data. Various information-theoretic bounds on the generalization error have been derived in the literature, where the mutual information between the training data and the hypothesis (the output of the learning algorithm) plays an important role. Focusing on the individual sample mutual information bound by Bu et al., which itself is a tightened version of the first bound on the topic by Russo et al. and Xu et al., this paper investigates the tightness of these bounds, in terms of the dependence of their convergence rates on the sample size $n$. It has been recognized that these bounds are in general not tight, readily verified for the exemplary quadratic Gaussian mean estimation problem, where the individual sample mutual information bound scales as $O(\sqrt{1/n})$ while the true generalization error scales as $O(1/n)$. The first contribution of this paper is to show that the same bound can in fact be asymptotically tight if an appropriate assumption is made. In particular, we show that the fast rate can be recovered when the assumption is made on the excess risk instead of the loss function, which was usually done in existing literature. A theoretical justification is given for this choice. The second contribution of the paper is a new set of generalization error bounds based on the $(\eta, c)$-central condition, a condition relatively easy to verify and has the property that the mutual information term directly determines the convergence rate of the bound. Several analytical and numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of these bounds.</description>

      <title>The Empirical Spectral Distribution of i.i.d. Random Matrices with Random Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large i.i.d. random matrix with deterministic low-rank perturbation has been extensively studied, particularly in the aspects of the ESD (Empirical Spectral Distribution) and the outliers of eigenvalues. In this work, we investigate the analogous scenario where the perturbation is random and extend the previous results from the deterministic perturbation to the random case. Specifically, we consider an i.i.d. matrix with random perturbation, $\mathbf{M}$. Our results show that: (i) the eigenvalue outliers of $\mathbf{M}$ converge to the eigenvalues of its perturbation; (ii) the ESD of $\mathbf{M}$ converges to the circular law; (iii) the eigenvector alignment holds for specific perturbations.
  As an application of the above random matrices, we present the first optimal query complexity lower bound for approximating the top eigenvector of asymmetric matrices. In the inverse polynomial accuracy regime, the complexity matches the upper bounds that can be obtained via the power method. As far as we know, it is the first lower bound for approximating the eigenvector of an asymmetric matrix.</description>

      <title>Fractional Subadditivity of Submodular Functions: Equality Conditions and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submodular functions are known to satisfy various forms of fractional subadditivity. This work investigates the conditions for equality to hold exactly or approximately in the fractional subadditivity of submodular functions. We establish that a small gap in the inequality implies that the function is close to being modular, and that the gap is zero if and only if the function is modular. We then present natural implications of these results for special cases of submodular functions, such as entropy, relative entropy, and matroid rank. As a consequence, we characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions for equality to hold in Shearer's lemma, recovering a result of Ellis \emph{et al.} (2016) as a special case. We leverage our results to propose a new multivariate mutual information, which generalizes Watanabe's total correlation (1960), Han's dual total correlation (1978), and Csisz\'ar and Narayan's shared information (2004), and analyze its properties. Among these properties, we extend Watanabe's characterization of total correlation as the maximum correlation over partitions to fractional partitions. When applied to matrix determinantal inequalities for positive definite matrices, our results recover the equality conditions of the classical determinantal inequalities of Hadamard, Sz\'asz, and Fischer as special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a two-terminal problem in which Alice and Bob aim to perform a joint measurement on a bipartite quantum system $\rho^{AB}$. Alice transmits the results of her measurements to Bob over a classical channel, and the two share common randomness. The central question is: what is the minimum amount of communication and common randomness required to faithfully simulate the measurement? This paper derives an achievable rate region.</description>

      <title>Beyond ISAC: Toward Integrated Heterogeneous Service Provisioning via Elastic Multi-Dimensional Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the growing complexity of vertical applications, current integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in wireless networks remains insufficient for supporting all required beyond communication services. To this end, future networks are evolving toward an integrated heterogeneous service provisioning (IHSP) platform, which seeks to integrate a broad range of heterogeneous services beyond the dual-function scope of ISAC. Nevertheless, this trend intensifies conflicts among concurrent heterogeneous service requirements under constrained resource sharing. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by the joint use of two novel elastic design strategies: compromised service value assessment and flexible multi-dimensional resource multiplexing. Consequently, we propose a value-prioritized elastic multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA) mechanism for IHSP systems. First, we modify the Value-of-Service (VoS) metric by incorporating elastic parameters to characterize user-specific tolerance and compromise in response to various performance degradations under constrained resources. This VoS metric serves as the foundation for prioritizing services and enabling effective fairness service scheduling among concurrent competing demands. Next, we adapt the MDMA to elastically multiplex services using appropriate multiple access schemes across different resource domains. This protocol leverages user-specific interference tolerances and cancellation capabilities across different domains to reduce resource-demanding conflicts and co-channel interference within the same domain. Then, we maximize the system's VoS by jointly optimizing MDMA and power allocation. Since this problem is non-convex, we develop a monotonic optimization-assisted dynamic programming algorithm for the optimal solution and a VoS-prioritized successive convex approximation algorithm for efficient suboptimal computation.</description>

      <title>Linear and Numerical SDoF Bounds of Active RIS-Assisted MIMO Wiretap Interference Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap interference channel (IC) serves as a canonical model for information-theoretic security, where a multiple-antenna eavesdropper attempts to intercept communications in a two-user MIMO IC system. The secure degrees-of-freedom (SDoF) of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted MIMO wiretap IC is with practical interests but remains unexplored. In this paper, we establish both sum-SDoF lower and upper bounds through linear beamforming conditions and numerical methods. Specifically, our proposed lower bound is derived from transmission scheme design and corresponding solutions to the sum-SDoF maximization problem, formulated by linear integer programming. The solutions to this optimization problem addresses RIS element allocation for leakage and interference cancellation. The proposed upper bound is obtained by solving a nuclear norm minimization problem, leveraging the fact that nuclear norm serves as a convex relaxation of the rank function. For symmetry antenna configurations, we derive a closed-form lower bound. Extensive numerical simulations show that our proposed lower and upper bounds coincide across many antenna configurations, and our proposed lower bound outperforms the existing benchmark.</description>

      <title>Area laws and tensor networks for maximally mixed ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show an area law in the mutual information for the
  maximally-mixed state $\Omega$ in the ground space of general
  Hamiltonians, which is independent of the underlying ground space
  degeneracy. Our result assumes the existence of a `good'
  approximation to the ground state projector (a good AGSP), a
  crucial ingredient in previous area-law proofs. Such approximations
  have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians and
  2D frustration-free locally-gapped Hamiltonians. As a
  corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any
  $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and any bi-partition $L\cup L^c$ of the system,
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} \le \mathrm O \big( \log (|L|\log(d))+\log(1/\varepsilon)\big),
  \end{align*}
  where $|L|$ represents the number of sites in $L$, $d$ is the dimension of a site and
  $ \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} $ represents the $\varepsilon$-\emph{smoothed
  maximum mutual information} with respect to the $L:L^c$ partition
  in $\Omega$. From this bound we then conclude $\mathrm I (L:L^c)_\Omega
  \le \mathrm O\big(\log(|L|\log(d))\big)$ -- an area law for the mutual information in
  1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show
  that $\Omega$ can be approximated in trace norm up to $\varepsilon$ with
  a state of Schmidt rank of at most $\mathrm{poly}(|L|/\varepsilon)$, leading to
  a good MPO approximation for $\Omega$ with polynomial bond
  dimension. Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual
  information of 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local
  Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Information and motor constraints shape melodic diversity across cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of possible melodies is unfathomably large, yet despite this virtually unlimited potential for melodic variation, melodies from different societies can be surprisingly similar. The motor constraint hypothesis accounts for certain similarities, such as scalar motion and contour shape, but not for other major common features, such as repetition, song length, and scale size. Here we investigate the role of information constraints in shaping these hallmarks of melodies. We measure determinants of information rate in 62 corpora of Folk melodies spanning several continents, finding multiple trade-offs that all act to constrain the information rate across societies. By contrast, 39 corpora of Art music from Europe (including Turkey) show longer, more complex melodies, and increased complexity over time, suggesting different cultural-evolutionary selection pressures in Art and Folk music, possibly due to the use of written versus oral transmission. Our parameter-free model predicts the empirical scale degree distribution using information constraints on scalar motion, melody length, and, most importantly, information rate. These results provide strong evidence that information constraints during cultural transmission of music limit the number of notes in a scale, and suggests that a tendency for intermediate melodic complexity reflects a fundamental constraint on the cultural evolution of melody.</description>

      <title>Informativity Conditions for Multiple Signals: Properties, Experimental Design, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of persistently exciting condition in single signal sequence for model identification and data-driven control methodologies. However, maintaining prolonged excitation in control signals introduces significant challenges, as continuous excitation can reduce the lifetime of mechanical devices. In this paper, we introduce three informativity conditions for various types of multi-signal data, each augmented by weight factors. We explore the interrelations between these conditions and their rank properties in linear time-invariant systems. Furthermore, we introduce open-loop experimental design methods tailored to each of the three conditions, which can synthesize the required excitation conditions either offline or online, even in the presence of limited information within each signal segment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these informativity conditions in least-squares identification. Additionally, all three conditions can extend Willems' fundamental lemma and are utilized to assess the properties of the system. Illustrative examples confirm that these conditions yield satisfactory outcomes in both least-squares identification and the construction of data-driven controllers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the dynamic structural resilience of international staple food trade networks: An entropy-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing a resilient food trade system is an international consensus on safeguarding food security amid growing disruptions. We employ an entropy-based approach to quantify the dynamic structural resilience of international trade networks for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat from 1986 to 2022. Using index decomposition analysis, we also investigate the relative contributions of several internal components to changes in resilience. Within this framework, despite heterogeneity across different food commodities, we find that current trade networks are relatively redundant, with improvements in efficiency being the dominant driver of changes in resilience. In addition, we reveal a historically pronounced impact of flow concentrations on resilience, while trade interactions have become increasingly important in recent years. Furthermore, following the leave-one-out approach, we identify critical economies and trade relationships that disproportionately affect the overall resilience, many of which are overlooked by conventional volume-based or centrality-based metrics. Moreover, we highlight that the overconcentration of flows along core trade relationships may undermine the overall efficiency and resilience, whereas peripheral trade networks play an essential role in sustaining resilience, underscoring the importance of promoting more equitable trade relations. These findings not only provide new insights for assessing the resilience of international food trade systems but also propose directions for making them more resilient.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A prediction makes a claim about a system's future given knowledge of its past. A retrodiction makes a claim about its past given knowledge of its future. The bidirectional machine is an ambidextrous hidden Markov chain that does both optimally by making explicit in its state structure all statistical correlation in a stochastic process. We introduce an informational taxonomy to profile these correlations via a suite of multivariate information measures. While prior results laid out the different kinds of information contained in isolated measurement of a bit, the associated informations were challenging to calculate explicitly. Overcoming this via bidirectional machine states, we expand that analysis to prediction and retrodiction. The result highlights fourteen new interpretable and calculable measures that characterize a process' informational structure. In addition, we introduce a labeling and indexing scheme that systematizes information-theoretic analyses of complex multivariate systems. Operationalizing this, we provide algorithms to directly calculate all of these quantities in closed form for finitely-modeled processes.</description>

      <title>Dim and Small Target Detection for Drone Broadcast Frames Based on Time-Frequency Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dim and small target detection algorithm for drone broadcast frames based on the time-frequency analysis of communication protocol. Specifically, by analyzing modulation parameters and frame structures, the prior knowledge of transmission frequency, signal bandwidth, Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, and frame length of drone broadcast frames is established. The RF signals are processed through the designed filter banks, and the frequency domain parameters of bounding boxes generated by the detector are corrected with transmission frequency and signal bandwidth. Given the remarkable correlation characteristics of ZC sequences, the frequency domain parameters of bounding boxes with low confidence scores are corrected based on ZC sequences and frame length, which improves the detection accuracy of dim targets under low signal-to noise ratio situations. Besides, a segmented energy refinement method is applied to mitigate the deviation caused by interference signals with high energy strength, which ulteriorly corrects the time domain detection parameters for dim targets. As the sampling duration increases, the detection speed improves while the detection accuracy of broadcast frames termed as small targets decreases. The trade-off between detection accuracy and speed versus sampling duration is established, which helps to meet different drone regulation requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the evaluation metrics by 2.27\% compared to existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm also performs strong robustness under varying flight distances, diverse types of environment noise, and different flight visual environment. Besides, the broadcast frame decoding results indicate that 97.30\% accuracy of RID has been achieved.</description>

      <title>Cross-Entropy Games for Language Models: From Implicit Knowledge to General Capability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent) Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary dynamics.</description>
