      <title>Anomalous geodesics in the inhomogeneous corner growth model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Busemann functions, semi-infinite geodesics, and competition interfaces in the exactly solvable last-passage percolation with inhomogeneous exponential weights. New phenomena concerning geodesics arise due to inhomogeneity. These include novel Busemann functions associated with flat regions of the limit shape and thin rectangles, undirected semi-infinite geodesics, non-trivial axis-directed geodesics, intervals with no geodesic directions, and isolated geodesic directions. We further observe a new dichotomy for competition interfaces and second-class customers in a series of memoryless continuous-time queues with inhomogeneous service rates: a second class customer either becomes trapped or proceeds through the queue at strictly positive speed.</description>

      <title>A revisit of the circular law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a complex random $n\times n$ matrix ${\bf X}_n=(x_{ij})_{n\times n}$, whose entries $x_{ij}$ are independent random variables with zero means and unit variances. It is well-known that Tao and Vu (Ann Probab 38: 2023-2065, 2010) resolved the circular law conjecture, establishing that if the $x_{ij}$'s are independent and identically distributed random variables with zero mean and unit variance, the empirical spectral distribution of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}{\bf X}_n$ converges almost surely to the uniform distribution over the unit disk in the complex plane as $n \to \infty$. This paper demonstrates that the circular law still holds under the more general Lindeberg's condition: $$ \frac1{n^2}\sum_{i,j=1}^n\mathbb{E}|x_{ij}^2|I(|x_{ij}|&gt;\eta\sqrt{n})\to 0,\mbox{as $n \to \infty$}. $$
  This paper is a revisit of the proof procedure of the circular law by Bai in (Ann Probab 25: 494-529, 1997). The key breakthroughs in the paper are establishing a general strong law of large numbers under Lindeberg's condition and the uniform upper bound for the integral with respect to the smallest eigenvalues of random matrices. These advancements significantly streamline and clarify the proof of the circular law, offering a more direct and simplified approach than other existing methodologies.</description>

      <title>The inverse uncertainty distribution of the solutions to a class of higher-order uncertain differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the higher-order uncertain differential equations (UDEs) as defined by Kaixi Zhang (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10700-024-09422-0), mainly focus on the second-order case. We propose a pivotal condition (monotonicity in some sense, see more details in Section 3), introduce the concept of $\alpha$-paths of UDEs, and demonstrate its properties. Based on this, we derive the inverse uncertainty distribution of the solution.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Universality of Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the free energy and ground state energy of spherical spin glasses are universal under the minimal moment assumptions. Previously such universality was known only for Ising spin glasses and random symmetric matrices, the latter being a celebrated result of Bai--Yin. Our methods extend to $\ell^q$ balls for $q&gt;2$, thus resolving a conjecture of Chen-Sen, and to tensor PCA.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness and propagation of chaos for general McKean-Vlasov and mean-field BSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with mean-field and McKean-Vlasov interactions in their generators in a general setting, where the drivers are square-integrable martingales, with a focus on the independent increments case, and the filtrations are (possibly) stochastically discontinuous. In other words, we consider discrete- and continuous-time systems of mean-field BSDEs and McKean-Vlasov BSDEs in a unified setting. We provide existence and uniqueness results for these BSDEs using new a priori estimates that utilize the stochastic exponential. Then, we provide propagation of chaos results for systems of particles that satisfy BSDEs, i.e. we show that the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of mean-field systems of BSDEs, as the multitude of the systems grows to infinity, converges to I.I.D solutions of McKean-Vlasov BSDEs. We introduce a new technique for showing the backward propagation of chaos, that makes repeated use of the a priori estimates, inequalities for the Wasserstein distance and the ``conservation of solutions'' under different filtrations, and does not demand the solutions of the mean field systems to be exchangeable or symmetric. Finally, we deduce convergence rates for the propagation of chaos, under advanced integrability conditions on the solutions of the BSDEs.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and probabilistic convergence of density functions of compact operators on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish some Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and probabilistic convergence of density functions related to compact operators on manifolds. Firstly, we present the suitable bound of $\int_{a\leq|s|\leq b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds(\gamma \in \mathbb{R},a\geq0,b&gt;0),$ $\int_{a\leq s\leq b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds(\gamma \in \mathbb{R},\gamma\neq0,a,b\in \mathbb{R})$ and $\int_{0\leq|s|&lt; +\infty}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds(\gamma \in \mathbb{R})$, which extends the result of Page 204 of Vega (199-211,IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 42, 1992.) Secondly, we prove that $\left|\gamma\int_{a}^{b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds\right|\leq C(1+|\gamma|)^{2}(\gamma \in \mathbb{R},a,b\in \mathbb{R}),$ where $C$ is independent of $\gamma,a, b$, which extends Lemma 1 of Bez et al. (Forum of Mathematics, Sigma, 9(2021), 1-52). Thirdly, we extend the result of Theorems 8, 9 of R. Frank, J. Sabin (Amer. J. Math. 139(2017), 1649-1691.) with the aid of the suitable bound of the above complex integrals established in this paper. Fourthly, we establish the Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions related to Boussinesq operator on the real line for both small time interval and large time interval and on the torus with small time interval; we also establish the convergence result of some compact operators in Schatten norm. Fifthly, we establish the convergence result related to nonlinear part of the solution to some operator equations in Schatten spaces. Finally, inspired by the work of Hadama and Yamamoto (Probabilistic Strichartz estimates in Schatten classes and their applications to Hartree equation, arxiv:2311.02713v1.), for $\gamma_{0}\in \mathfrak{S}^{2}$, we establish the probabilistic convergence of density functions of compact operator on manifolds with full randomization, which improves the result of Corollary 1.2 of Bez et al. (Selecta Math. 26(2020), 24 pp) in the probabilistic sense.</description>

      <title>The game behind oriented percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the critical parameter of oriented percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ through the value of a zero-sum game. Specifically, we define a zero-sum game on a percolation configuration of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, where two players move a token along the non-oriented edges of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, collecting a cost of 1 for each edge that is open, and 0 otherwise. The total cost is given by the limit superior of the average cost. We demonstrate that the value of this game is deterministic and equals 1 if and only if the percolation parameter exceeds $p_c$, the critical exponent of oriented percolation. Additionally, we establish that the value of the game is continuous at $p_c$. Finally, we show that for $p$ close to 0, the value of the game is equal to 0.</description>

      <title>Conditioning to avoid zero via a class of concave functions for one-dimensional diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For one-dimensional diffusions on the half-line, we study a specific type of conditioning to avoid zero. We introduce martingales via a class of functions that are concave with respect to the scale function and similar to the densities of quasi-stationary distributions. The conditioning is formulated through the exit times of the martingale, and its existence is shown. We investigate its relation to the Yaglom limit and the absolute continuity relations of the limit processes at time infinity.</description>

      <title>Some recent progress on the periodic KPZ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent progress on the study of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in a periodic setting, which describes the random growth of an interface in a cylindrical geometry. The main results include central limit theorems for the height of the interface and the winding number of the directed polymer in a periodic random environment. We present two different approaches for each result, utilizing either a homogenization argument or tools from Malliavin calculus. A surprising finding in the case of a $1+1$ spacetime white noise is that the effective variances for both the height and the winding number can be expressed in terms of independent Brownian bridges.
  Additionally, we present two new results: (i) the explicit expression of the corrector used in the homogenization argument, and (ii) the law of the iterated logarithm for the height function.</description>

      <title>Universality of the mean-field equations of networks of Hopfield-like neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of characterising the mean-field limit of a network of Hopfield-like neurons. Building on the previous work of \cite{guionnet:95,ben-arous-guionnet:95,guionnet:97} and \cite{dembo_universality_2021} we establish for a large class of networks of Hopfield-like neurons, i.e. rate neurons, the mean-field equations on a time interval $[0,\,T]$, $T&gt;0$, of the thermodynamic limit of these networks, i.e. the limit when the number of neurons goes to infinity. Unlike all previous work, except \cite{dembo_universality_2021}, we do not assume that the synaptic weights describing the connections between the neurons are i.i.d. as zero-mean Gaussians. The limit equations are stochastic and very simply described in terms of two functions, a ``correlation'' function noted $K_Q(t,\,s)$ and a ``mean'' function noted $m_Q(t)$. The ``noise'' part of the equations is a linear function of the Brownian motion, which is obtained by solving a Volterra equation of the second kind whose resolving kernel is expressed as a function of $K_Q$. We give a constructive proof of the uniqueness of the limit equations. We use the corresponding algorithm for an effective computation of the functions $K_Q$ and $m_Q$, given the weights distribution. Several numerical experiments are reported.</description>

      <title>The smallest singular value of inhomogenous random rectangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times n}$ ($N \geq n$) be a random matrix with columns that are mean 0 and isotropic and with independent entries having bounded $2+\beta$ moments. We show that the smallest singular value $\sigma_n(A)$ satisfies
  \[
  \Pr \left(\sigma_n(A) \leq \varepsilon(\sqrt{N+1} - \sqrt{n})\right) \leq (C\varepsilon)^{N-n+1} + e^{-cN},
  \]
  for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, where $c,C$ depend only on $\beta$ and the $2+\beta$ moments. This extends earlier results of Rudelson and Vershynin, who showed that such lower tail estimates held for rectangular matrices with i.i.d. mean-0 subgaussian entries. When the $2+\beta$ moment assumption is replaced with a uniform anti-concentration assumption, $\sup_z \Pr\left(|X-z| &lt; a\right) &lt; b$, we show that
  \[
  \Pr\left(\sigma_n(A) \leq \varepsilon(\sqrt{N+1} - \sqrt{n})\right) \leq (C\varepsilon\log(1/\varepsilon))^{N-n+1} + e^{-cN},
  \]
  where $c_2,C_3$ now depend only on $a$ and $b$. This extends more recent work of Livshyts, whose showed that such lower tail estimates held for rectrangular matrices with i.i.d. rows. To prove these results we employ a number of new technical ingredients, including a new deviation inequality for the regularized Hilbert-Schmidt norm and a recently proven small ball estimate for the distance between a random vector and a subspace spanned by an inhomogeneous rectangular matrix.</description>

      <title>Non-convex matrix sensing: Breaking the quadratic rank barrier in the sample complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, two classes of algorithms have been widely studied in the literature: convex approaches based on nuclear norm minimization, and non-convex approaches that use factorized gradient descent. Under certain statistical model assumptions, it is known that nuclear norm minimization recovers the ground truth as soon as the number of samples scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the ground-truth. In contrast, while non-convex approaches are computationally less expensive, existing recovery guarantees assume that the number of samples scales at least quadratically with the rank $r$ of the ground-truth matrix. In this paper, we close this gap by showing that the non-convex approaches can be as efficient as nuclear norm minimization in terms of sample complexity. Namely, we consider the problem of reconstructing a positive semidefinite matrix from a few Gaussian measurements. We show that factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the ground truth with a linear rate as soon as the number of samples scales with $ \Omega (rd\kappa^2)$, where $d$ is the dimension, and $\kappa$ is the condition number of the ground truth matrix. This improves the previous rank-dependence from quadratic to linear. Our proof relies on a probabilistic decoupling argument, where we show that the gradient descent iterates are only weakly dependent on the individual entries of the measurement matrices. We expect that our proof technique is of independent interest for other non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>Anti-Concentration Inequalities for the Difference of Maxima of Gaussian Random Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive novel anti-concentration bounds for the difference between the maximal values of two Gaussian random vectors across various settings. Our bounds are dimension-free, scaling with the dimension of the Gaussian vectors only through the smaller expected maximum of the Gaussian subvectors. In addition, our bounds hold under the degenerate covariance structures, which previous results do not cover. In addition, we show that our conditions are sharp under the homogeneous component-wise variance setting, while we only impose some mild assumptions on the covariance structures under the heterogeneous variance setting. We apply the new anti-concentration bounds to derive the central limit theorem for the maximizers of discrete empirical processes. Finally, we back up our theoretical findings with comprehensive numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Reduced Models to Unravel Transitions in Non-equilibrium Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a general framework for capturing noise-driven transitions in spatially extended non-equilibrium systems and explains the emergence of coherent patterns beyond the instability onset. The framework relies on stochastic parameterizations to reduce the original equations' complexity while capturing the key effects of unresolved scales. It works for both Gaussian and Levy-type noise. Our parameterizations offer two key advantages. First, they approximate stochastic invariant manifolds when the latter exist. Second, even when such manifolds break down, our formulas can be adapted by a simple optimization of its constitutive parameters. This allows us to handle scenarios with weak time-scale separation where the system has undergone multiple transitions, resulting in large-amplitude solutions not captured by invariant manifold or other time-scale separation methods. The optimized stochastic parameterizations capture how small-scale noise impacts larger scales through the system's nonlinear interactions. This effect is achieved by the very fabric of our parameterizations incorporating non-Markovian coefficients into the reduced equation. Such coefficients account for the noise's past influence using a finite memory length, selected for optimal performance. The specific "memory" function, which determines how this past influence is weighted, depends on the noise's strength and how it interacts with the system's nonlinearities. Remarkably, training our theory-guided reduced models on a single noise path effectively learns the optimal memory length for out-of-sample predictions, including rare events. This success stems from our "hybrid" approach, which combines analytical understanding with data-driven learning. This combination avoids a key limitation of purely data-driven methods: their struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, also known as the "extrapolation problem."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the well-posedness theory for renormalized entropy solutions of a degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic PDE perturbed by a multiplicative Levy noise with general L1-data on the unbounded domain. By using a suitable approximation procedure based on the vanishing viscosity technique and bounded data, we prove the existence of a renormalized entropy solution to the underlying problem. The uniqueness of the solution is settled by adapting Kru\v{z}kov's doubling the variables technique in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Some properties on the reversibility and the linear response theory of Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear response theory is a fundamental framework studying the macroscopic response of a physical system to an external perturbation. This paper focuses on the rigorous mathematical justification of linear response theory for Langevin dynamics. We give some equivalent characterizations for reversible overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics, which is the unperturbed reference system. Then we clarify sufficient conditions for the smoothness and exponential convergence to the invariant measure for the overdamped case. We also clarify those sufficient conditions for the underdamped case, which corresponds to hypoellipticity and hypocoercivity. Based on these, the asymptotic dependence of the response function on the small perturbation is proved in both finite and infinite time horizons. As applications, Green-Kubo relations and linear response theory for a generalized Langevin dynamics are also proved in a rigorous fashion.</description>

      <title>Tree-structured Markov random fields with Poisson marginal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new family of tree-structured Markov random fields for a vector of discrete counting random variables is introduced. According to the characteristics of the family, the marginal distributions of the Markov random fields are all Poisson with the same mean, and are untied from the strength or structure of their built-in dependence. This key feature is uncommon for Markov random fields and most convenient for applications purposes. The specific properties of this new family confer a straightforward sampling procedure and analytic expressions for the joint probability mass function and the joint probability generating function of the vector of counting random variables, thus granting computational methods that scale well to vectors of high dimension. We study the distribution of the sum of random variables constituting a Markov random field from the proposed family, analyze a random variable's individual contribution to that sum through expected allocations, and establish stochastic orderings to assess a wide understanding of their behavior.</description>

      <title>High Order Smoothness for Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations with Transport and Stretching Noise on Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain energy estimates for a transport and stretching noise under Leray Projection on a 2D bounded convex domain, in Sobolev Spaces of arbitrarily high order. The estimates are taken in equivalent inner products, defined through powers of the Stokes Operator with a specific choice of Navier boundary conditions. We exploit fine properties of the noise in relation to the Stokes Operator to achieve cancellation of derivatives in the presence of the Leray Projector. As a result, we achieve an additional degree of regularity in the corresponding Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equation to attain a true strong solution of the original Stratonovich equation. Furthermore for any order of smoothness, we can construct a strong solution of a hyperdissipative version of the Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equation with the given regularity; hyperdissipation is only required to control the nonlinear term in the presence of a boundary. We supplement the result by obtaining smoothness without hyperdissipation on the torus, in 2D and 3D on the lifetime of solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic bounds for forward processes in denoising diffusions: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck is hard to beat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) represent a recent advance in generative modelling that has delivered state-of-the-art results across many domains of applications. Despite their success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the error within DDPMs, particularly the non-asymptotic bounds required for the comparison of their efficiency, remain scarce. Making minimal assumptions on the initial data distribution, allowing for example the manifold hypothesis, this paper presents explicit non-asymptotic bounds on the forward diffusion error in total variation (TV), expressed as a function of the terminal time $T$.
  We parametrise multi-modal data distributions in terms of the distance $R$ to their furthest modes and consider forward diffusions with additive and multiplicative noise. Our analysis rigorously proves that, under mild assumptions, the canonical choice of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process cannot be significantly improved in terms of reducing the terminal time $T$ as a function of $R$ and error tolerance $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Motivated by data distributions arising in generative modelling, we also establish a cut-off like phenomenon (as $R\to\infty$) for the convergence to its invariant measure in TV of an OU process, initialized at a multi-modal distribution with maximal mode distance $R$.</description>

      <title>A higher-order Otto calculus approach to the Gaussian completely monotone conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian completely monotone (GCM) conjecture states that the $m$-th time-derivative of the entropy along the heat flow on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is positive for $m$ even and negative for $m$ odd. We prove the GCM conjecture for orders up to $m=5$, assuming that the initial measure is log-concave, in any dimension. Our proof differs significantly from previous approaches to the GCM conjecture: it is based on Otto calculus and on the interpretation of the heat flow as the Wasserstein gradient flow of the entropy. Crucial to our methodology is the observation that the convective derivative behaves as a flat connection over probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular we prove a form of the univariate Faa di Bruno's formula on the Wasserstein space (despite it being curved), and we compute the higher-order Wasserstein differentials of internal energy functionals (including the entropy), both of which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A model for horizontally restricted random square-tiled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A square-tiled surface (STS) is a (finite, possibly branched) cover of the standard square-torus with possible branching over exactly 1 point. Alternately, STSs can be viewed as finitely many axis-parallel squares with sides glued in parallel pairs. After a labelling of the squares by $\{1, \dots, n\}$, we can describe an STS with $n$ squares using two permutations $\sigma, \tau \in S_n$, where $\sigma$ encodes how the squares are glued horizontally and $\tau$ encodes how the squares are glued vertically. Hence, a previously considered natural model for STSs with $n$ squares is $S_n \times S_n$ with the uniform distribution. We modify this model to obtain a new one: We fix $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and let $\mathcal{K}_\mu$ be a conjugacy class of $S_n$ with at most $n^\alpha$ cycles. Then $\mathcal{K}_\mu \times S_n$ with the uniform distribution is a model for STSs with restricted horizontal gluings. We deduce the asymptotic (as $n$ grows) number of components, genus distribution, most likely stratum and set of holonomy vectors of saddle connections for random STSs in this new model.</description>

      <title>Representative Arm Identification: A fixed confidence approach to identify cluster representatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the representative arm identification (RAI) problem in the multi-armed bandits (MAB) framework, wherein we have a collection of arms, each associated with an unknown reward distribution. An underlying instance is defined by a partitioning of the arms into clusters of predefined sizes, such that for any $j &gt; i$, all arms in cluster $i$ have a larger mean reward than those in cluster $j$. The goal in RAI is to reliably identify a certain prespecified number of arms from each cluster, while using as few arm pulls as possible. The RAI problem covers as special cases several well-studied MAB problems such as identifying the best arm or any $M$ out of the top $K$, as well as both full and coarse ranking. We start by providing an instance-dependent lower bound on the sample complexity of any feasible algorithm for this setting. We then propose two algorithms, based on the idea of confidence intervals, and provide high probability upper bounds on their sample complexity, which orderwise match the lower bound. Finally, we do an empirical comparison of both algorithms along with an LUCB-type alternative on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed schemes in most cases.</description>

Abstract: On an abstract Wiener space, assume that T is the solution of the quadratic Monge problem associated to the Wiener measure and a second one with a Radon-Nikodym derivative of exponential type. Under the finite information hypothesis, using a variational method, we prove that T minimizes a certain functional originating from the large deviations theory. Applying a variational method a la Euler, we obtain the Sobolev regularity of the backward Monge-Brenier map. A similar result also holds for the forward Monge-Brenier map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.04699v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the topological structure of large scale interacting systems on infinite graphs, by constructing a suitable cohomology which we call the uniform cohomology. The central idea for the construction is the introduction of a class of functions called uniform functions. Uniform cohomology provides a new perspective for the identification of macroscopic observables from the microscopic system. As a straightforward application of our theory when the underlying graph has a free action of a group, we prove a certain decomposition theorem for shift-invariant closed uniform forms. This result is a uniform version in a very general setting of the decomposition result for shift-invariant closed $L^2$-forms originally proposed by Varadhan, which has repeatedly played a key role in the proof of the hydrodynamic limits of nongradient large scale interacting systems. In a subsequent article, we use this result as a key to prove Varadhan's decomposition theorem for a general class of large scale interacting systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on the one-dimensional finite lattice $\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$. The particles can be created/annihilated at the boundaries with given rates. These rates are $L^\infty$ functions of time and are independent of the jump rates in the bulk. The boundary dynamics is modified by a factor $N^\theta$ with $\theta&gt;0$. We study the hydrodynamic limit for the particle density profile under the hyperbolic space-time scale. The macroscopic equation is given by (inviscid) Burgers equation with Dirichlet type boundaries that is characterized by the boundary entropy. A grading scheme is developed to control the formulation of boundary layers on the microscopic level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the geometric ergodicity of the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm under nonconvexity settings. Via the technique of reflection coupling, we prove the Wasserstein contraction of SGLD when the target distribution is log-concave only outside some compact set. The time discretization and the minibatch in SGLD introduce several difficulties when applying the reflection coupling, which are addressed by a series of careful estimates of conditional expectations. As a direct corollary, the SGLD with constant step size has an invariant distribution and we are able to obtain its geometric ergodicity in terms of $W_1$ distance. The generalization to non-gradient drifts is also included.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the pruning processes of stable Galton-Watson trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the work of Aldous and Pitman (1998), several authors have studied the pruning processes of Galton-Watson trees and their continuous analogue L\'evy trees. L\"ohr, Voisin and Winter (2015) introduced the space of bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees equipped with the so-called leaf sampling weak vague topology which allows them to unify the discrete and the continuous picture by considering them as instances of the same Feller-continuous Markov process with different initial conditions. Moreover, the authors show that these so-called pruning processes converge in the Skorokhod space of c\`adl\`ag paths with values in the space of bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees, whenever the initial bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees converge.
  In this paper we provide an application to the above principle by verifying that a sequence of suitably rescaled critical conditioned Galton-Watson trees whose offspring distributions lie in the domain of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha \in (1,2]$ converge to the $\alpha$-stable L\'evy-tree in the leaf-sampling weak vague topology.</description>

Abstract: We provide asymptotic theory for the joint distribution of $X_{\mathrm{inv}}$ and $X_{\mathrm{des}}$, the numbers of inversions and descents of random permutations. Recently, D\"orr &amp; Kahle (2022) proved that $X_{\mathrm{inv}}$, respectively, $X_{\mathrm{des}}$ is in the maximum domain of attraction of the Gumbel distribution. To tackle the dependency between these two permutation statistics, we use H\'ajek projections and a suitable quantitative Gaussian approximation. We show that $(X_{\mathrm{inv}}, X_{\mathrm{des}})$ is in the maximum domain of attraction of the two-dimensional Gumbel distribution with independent margins. This result can be stated in the broader combinatorial framework of finite Coxeter groups, on which our method also yields the central limit theorem for $(X_{\mathrm{inv}}, X_{\mathrm{des}})$ and various other permutation statistics as a novel contribution. In particular, signed permutation groups with random biased signs and products of classical Weyl groups are investigated.</description>

      <title>Gaussian deconvolution and the lace expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give conditions on a real-valued function $F$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d&gt;2$, which ensure that the solution $G$ to the convolution equation $(F*G)(x) = \delta_{0,x}$ has Gaussian decay $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ for large $|x|$. Precursors of our results were obtained in the 2000s, using intricate Fourier analysis. In 2022, a very simple deconvolution theorem was proved, but its applicability was limited. We extend the 2022 theorem to remove its limitations while maintaining its simplicity -- our main tools are H\"older's inequality, weak derivatives, and basic Fourier theory in $L^p$ space. Our motivation comes from critical phenomena in equilibrium statistical mechanics, where the convolution equation is provided by the lace expansion and $G$ is a critical two-point function. Our results significantly simplify existing proofs of critical $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ decay in high dimensions for self-avoiding walk, Ising and $\varphi^4$ models, percolation, and lattice trees and lattice animals. We also improve previous error estimates.</description>

      <title>Mixed Poisson process with Min-U-Exp mixing variable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work continues the research done in Jordanova and Veleva (2023) where the history of the problem could be found. In order to obtain the structure distribution of the newly-defined Mixed Poisson process, here the operation "max" is replaced with "min". We start with the definition of Min-U-Exp distribution. Then, we compute its numerical characteristics and investigate some of its properties. The joint distribution of the inter-arrival times (which are dependent) is the Multivariate Exp-Min-U-Exp distribution of $II^{-nd}$ kind. Its univariate and multivariate versions are described, and the formulae for their numerical characteristics are obtained. The distribution of the moments of arrival of different events is called Erlang-Min-U-Exp. Different properties of these distributions are obtained, and their numerical characteristics are computed. Multivariate ordered Mixed Poisson-Min-U-Exp distribution describes the joint distribution of the time-intersection of a Mixed Poisson process with Min-U-Exp mixing variable. The corresponding distribution of the additive increments (which are also dependent) is the Mixed Poisson-Min-U-Exp one. The considered relations between these distributions simplify their understanding.</description>

      <title>Restricted Path Characteristic Function Determines the Law of Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central question in rough path theory is characterising the law of stochastic processes. It is established in [I. Chevyrev $\&amp;$ T. Lyons, Characteristic functions of measures on geometric rough paths, $\textit{Ann. Probab.}$ $\textbf{44}$ (2016), 4049--4082] that the path characteristic function (PCF), $\textit{i.e.}$, the expectation of the unitary development of the path, uniquely determines the law of the unparametrised path. We show that PCF restricted to certain subspaces of sparse matrices is sufficient to achieve this goal. The key to our arguments is an explicit algorithm -- as opposed to the nonconstructive approach in [I. Chevyrev $ \&amp;$ T. Lyons, $\textit{op. cit.}$] -- for determining a generic element $X$ of the tensor algebra $\mathcal{T}\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right) = \bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right)^{\otimes n}$ from its moment generating function. Our only assumption is that $X$ has a nonzero radius of convergence, which relaxes the condition of having an infinite radius of convergence in the literature.
  As applications of the above theoretical findings, we propose the restricted path characteristic function distance (RPCFD), a novel distance function for probability measures on the path space that offers enormous advantages for dimension reduction. Its effectiveness is validated via hypothesis testing on fractional Brownian motions, thus demonstrating the potential of RPCFD in generative modeling for synthetic time series generation.</description>

      <title>ISDE with logarithmic interaction and characteristic polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider certain random matrix eigenvalue dynamics, akin to Dyson Brownian motion, introduced by Rider and Valko. We show that from every initial condition, including ones involving coinciding coordinates, the dynamics, enhanced with more information, converge on path-space to a new infinite-dimensional Feller-continuous diffusion process. We show that the limiting diffusion solves an infinite-dimensional system of stochastic differential equations (ISDE) with logarithmic interaction. Moreover, we show convergence in the long-time limit of the infinite-dimensional dynamics starting from any initial condition to the equilibrium measure, given by the inverse points of the Bessel determinantal point process. As far as we can tell, this is: (a) the first path-space convergence result of random matrix dynamics starting from every initial condition to an infinite-dimensional Feller diffusion, (b) the first construction of solutions to an ISDE with logarithmic interaction from every initial condition for which the singular drift term can be defined at time $0$, (c) the first convergence to equilibrium result from every initial condition for an ISDE of this kind. The argument splits into two parts. The first part builds on the method of intertwiners introduced and developed by Borodin and Olshanski. The main new ingredients are a uniform, in a certain sense, approximation theorem of the spectrum of a family of random matrices indexed by an infinite-dimensional space and an extension of the method of intertwiners to deal with convergence to equilibrium. The second part introduces a new approach towards convergence of the singular drift term in the dynamics and for showing non-intersection of the limiting paths via certain ``characteristic polynomials" associated to the process. We believe variations of it will be applicable to other infinite-dimensional dynamics coming from random matrices.</description>

      <title>Random Vector Functional Link Networks for Function Approximation on Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.15776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The learning speed of feed-forward neural networks is notoriously slow and has presented a bottleneck in deep learning applications for several decades. For instance, gradient-based learning algorithms, which are used extensively to train neural networks, tend to work slowly when all of the network parameters must be iteratively tuned. To counter this, both researchers and practitioners have tried introducing randomness to reduce the learning requirement. Based on the original construction of Igelnik and Pao, single layer neural-networks with random input-to-hidden layer weights and biases have seen success in practice, but the necessary theoretical justification is lacking. In this paper, we begin to fill this theoretical gap. We provide a (corrected) rigorous proof that the Igelnik and Pao construction is a universal approximator for continuous functions on compact domains, with approximation error decaying asymptotically like $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ for the number $n$ of network nodes. We then extend this result to the non-asymptotic setting, proving that one can achieve any desired approximation error with high probability provided $n$ is sufficiently large. We further adapt this randomized neural network architecture to approximate functions on smooth, compact submanifolds of Euclidean space, providing theoretical guarantees in both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic forms. Finally, we illustrate our results on manifolds with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The Quantization Monte Carlo method for solving radiative transport equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Quantization Monte Carlo method to solve thermal radiative transport equations with possibly several collision regimes, ranging from few collisions to massive number of collisions per time unit. For each particle in a given simulation cell, the proposed method advances the time by replacing many collisions with sampling directly from the escape distribution of the particle. In order to perform the sampling, for each triplet of parameters (opacity, remaining time, initial position in the cell) on a parameter grid, the escape distribution is precomputed offline and only the quantiles are retained. The online computation samples only from this quantized (i.e., discrete) version by choosing a parameter triplet on the grid (close to actual particle's parameters) and returning at random one quantile from the precomputed set of quantiles for that parameter. We first check numerically that the escape laws depend smoothly on the parameters and then implement the procedure on a benchmark with good results.</description>

Abstract: Ayyer and Linusson studied correlations in the multispecies TASEP on a ring (Trans AMS, 2017) using a combinatorial analysis of the multiline queues construction defined by Ferrari and Martin (AOP, 2008). It is natural to explore whether an analogous application of appropriate multiline queues could give similar results for the partially asymmetric case. In this paper, we solve this problem of correlations of adjacent particles on the first two sites in the multispecies PASEP on a finite ring. We use the multiline processes defined by Martin (EJP, 2020), the dynamics of which also depend on the asymmetry parameter $q$, to compute the correlations.</description>

Abstract: Following Parisi \&amp; Wu's paradigm of stochastic quantization, we constructed in \cite{BDFT} a $\Phi^4$ measure on an arbitrary closed, compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $3$ as an invariant measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation. This solves a longstanding open problem in quantum fields on curved backgrounds. In the present work, we build all the harmonic and microlocal analysis tools that are needed in \cite{BDFT}. In particular, we extend the approach of Jagannath--Perkowski to the vectorial $\Phi^4_3$ model by introducing a new Cole-Hopf transform involving random bundle maps.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Monte Carlo Approximations to the Distribution of the First Passage Time of the Drifted Diffusion with Stochastic Resetting and Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03939v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces two techniques for computing the distribution of the absorption or first passage time of the drifted Wiener diffusion subject to Poisson resetting times, to an upper hard wall barrier and to a lower absorbing barrier. The first method, which we call ``Pad\'e-partial fraction'' approximation, starts with the Pad\'e approximation to the Laplace transform of the first passage time distribution, which is then exactly inverted by means of the partial fraction decomposition. The second method, which we call "multiresolution algorithm", is a Monte Carlo technique that exploits the properties of the Wiener process in order to generate Brownian bridges at increasing levels of resolution. Our numerical study reveals that the multiresolution algorithm has higher efficiency than standard Monte Carlo, whereas the faster Pad\'e-partial fraction method is accurate in various circumstances and provides an analytical formula. Also, a closed-form exact expression for the expected first passage time is derived.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification using Simulation Output: Batching as an Inferential Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present batching as an omnibus device for uncertainty quantification using simulation output. We consider the classical context of a simulationist performing uncertainty quantification on an estimator $\theta_n$ (of an unknown fixed quantity $\theta$) using only the output data $(Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_n)$ gathered from a simulation. By uncertainty quantification, we mean approximating the sampling distribution of the error $\theta_n-\theta$ toward: (A) estimating an assessment functional $\psi$, e.g., bias, variance, or quantile; or (B) constructing a $(1-\alpha)$-confidence region on $\theta$. We argue that batching is a remarkably simple and effective device for this purpose, and is especially suited for handling dependent output data such as what one frequently encounters in simulation contexts. We demonstrate that if the number of batches and the extent of their overlap are chosen appropriately, batching retains bootstrap's attractive theoretical properties of strong consistency and higher-order accuracy. For constructing confidence regions, we characterize two limiting distributions associated with a Studentized statistic. Our extensive numerical experience confirms theoretical insight, especially about the effects of batch size and batch overlap.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transition Paths for AMOC Collapse and Recovery in a Stochastic Box Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is strong evidence that the present-day Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is in a bi-stable regime and hence it is important to determine probabilities and pathways for noise-induced transitions between its equilibrium states. Here, using Large Deviation Theory (LDT), the most probable transition pathways for the noise-induced collapse and recovery of the AMOC are computed in a stochastic box model of the World Ocean. This allows us to determine the physical mechanisms of noise-induced AMOC transitions. We show that the most likely path of an AMOC collapse starts paradoxically with a strengthening of the AMOC followed by an immediate drop within a couple of years due to a short but relatively strong freshwater pulse. The recovery on the other hand is a slow process, where the North Atlantic needs to be gradually salinified over a course of 20 years. The proposed method provides several benefits, including an estimate of probability ratios of collapse between various freshwater noise scenarios, showing that the AMOC is most vulnerable to freshwater forcing into the Atlantic thermocline region. Moreover, a comparison with a quasi-equilibrium approach reveals the contrasts in behavior of a bifurcation-induced and a noise-induced collapse of the AMOC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive differential equations for multiplicative statistics of the Bessel determinantal point process depending on two parameters. In particular, we prove that such statistics are solutions to an integrable nonlinear partial differential equation describing isospectral deformations of a Sturm-Liouville equation. We also derive identities relating solutions to the integrable partial differential equation and to the Sturm-Liouville equation which imply an analogue for Painlev\'e V of Amir-Corwin-Quastel "integro-differential Painlev\'e II equation". This equation reduces, in a degenerate limit, to the system of coupled Painlev\'e V equations derived by Charlier and Doeraene for the generating function of the Bessel process, and to the Painlev\'e V equation derived by Tracy and Widom for the gap probability of the Bessel process. Finally, we study an initial value problem for the integrable partial differential equation. The approach is based on Its-Izergin-Korepin-Slavnov theory of integrable operators and their associated Riemann-Hilbert problems.</description>

It encompasses the integration of H\"older differential forms introduced by R. Z\"ust: if $f$, $g_1, \dots, g_d$ are merely H\"older continuous functions on the cube $[0, 1]^d$ whose H\"older exponents satisfy a certain condition, it is possible to interpret $\mathrm{d}g_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}g_d$ as a H\"older charge and thus to make sense of the integral \[ \int_B f \mathrm{d} g_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}g_d \] over a set $B \subset [0, 1]^d$ of finite perimeter.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider a risk process to model the capital of a household. Our work focuses on the analysis of the trapping time of such a process, where trapping occurs when a household's capital level falls into the poverty area. A function analogous to the classical Gerber-Shiu function is introduced, which incorporates information on the trapping time, the capital surplus immediately before trapping and the capital deficit at trapping. We derive, under some assumptions, a model belonging to the family of generalised beta (GB) distributions that describes the distribution of the capital deficit at trapping given that trapping occurs. Affinities between the capital deficit at trapping and a class of poverty measures, known as the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index, are presented. The versatility of this model to estimate FGT indices is assessed using household microdata from Burkina Faso's Enqu\^ete Multisectorielle Continue (EMC) 2014.</description>

      <title>The Solution to an Impulse Control Problem Motivated by Optimal Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic impulse control problem that is motivated by applications such as the optimal exploitation of a natural resource. In particular, we consider a stochastic system whose uncontrolled state dynamics are modelled by a non-explosive positive linear diffusion. The control that can be applied to this system takes the form of one-sided impulsive action. The objective of the control problem is to maximise a discounted performance criterion that rewards the effect of control action but involves a fixed cost at each time of a control intervention. We derive the complete solution to this problem under general assumptions. It turns out that the solution can take four qualitatively different forms, several of which have not been observed in the literature. In two of the four cases, there exist only $\varepsilon$-optimal control strategies. We also show that the boundary classification of 0 may play a critical role in the solution of the problem. Furthermore, we develop a way for establishing the strong solution to a stochastic impulse control problem's optimally controlled SDE.</description>

      <title>A non-autonomous framework for climate change and extreme weather events increase in a stochastic energy balance model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a three-timescale framework for modelling climate change and introduce a space-heterogeneous one-dimensional energy balance model. This model, addressing temperature fluctuations from rising carbon dioxide levels and the super-greenhouse effect in tropical regions, fits within the setting of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations. Our results show how both mean and variance of temperature increase, without the system going through a bifurcation point. This study aims to advance the conceptual understanding of the extreme weather events frequency increase due to climate change.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dynamical systems as zero-noise limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dynamical system may be defined by a simple transition law - such as a map or a vector field. The objective of most learning techniques is to reconstruct this dynamic transition law. This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic properties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or invariant measure. One of the major theoretical challenges for numerical methods is that approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient to approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of representing a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as the zero-noise limit of a Markov process. The Markov process approximation is completely data-driven. Besides proving a low-noise approximation of the dynamics the process also approximates the invariant set, via the support of its stationary measures. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with complicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under further assumptions, we show that the technique performs a convergent statistical approximation as well as approximations of true orbits.</description>

      <title>On the Lottery Problem: Tracing Stefan Mandel's Combinatorial Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stefan Mandel is the man who won the lottery 14 times. He never disclosed the recipe he called combinatorial condensation, which enabled him to hit the Romanian lottery jackpot in the early phase of his betting career. Combinatorial condensation is frequently mixed up with another strategy known as buying the pot, which Stefan Mandel was pursuing later on. On occasion, he dropped a few hints on combinatorial condensation. The hints are applied in this work to narrow down and assess his initial recipe. The underlying theory resembles what a weekend mathematician, as he once referred to himself, may have encountered in the 1960s. Calculations indicate that he took residual risks that his method might fail. Residual risks explain why he changed his strategy from combinatorial condensation to buying the pot. The cardinality of the (15, 6, 6, 5)- and (49, 6, 6, 5)-lottery schemes shows that Stefan Mandel probably wasn't aware of lottery designs. First concepts on such topics had been available at that time, but coherent theories on combinatorial designs took off only in later decades, triggered by growing computing power, and eventually triggered by Stefan Mandel's publicity and successes in the field. But, as the comparison with actual covering designs reveals, Stefan Mandel most likely pioneered in constructing a (15, 6, 5)-covering design many years before others published about it, which he applied in the Romanian lottery.</description>
