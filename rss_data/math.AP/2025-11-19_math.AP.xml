      <title>Blow-up, decay, and convergence to equilibrium for focusing damped cubic Klein-Gordon and Duffing equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study long-time dynamics of the damped focusing cubic Klein-Gordon equation on a compact three-dimensional Riemannian manifold, together with its space-independent reduction, the damped focusing Duffing equation. Under the geometric control condition on the damping and an assumption on the set of stationary solutions, we establish a sharp trichotomy for initial data with energy slightly above that of the ground state: every solution either blows up in finite time, decays exponentially to zero, or converges to a ground state. We provide a complete classification of the Duffing dynamics above the energy of the constant solution, use it to construct Klein-Gordon solutions realising each of the three behaviours, and derive a simple spectral criterion ensuring that the ground states are nonconstant--and hence that the solutions realising the three regimes lie above the ground-state energy.</description>

      <title>A New approach for the unsteady Stokes equations with time fractional derivative in Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel variational framework for the study of the unsteady Stokes equations in a bounded open Lipschitz domain in R^n, involving a Caputo fractional derivative in time. The nonlocal nature of the fractional derivative presents significant analytical challenges, making classical methods such as the Faedo-Galerkin approach inadequate in their standard form for a full analysis of the problem. To address these difficulties, we develop and rigorously analyze new functional spaces specifically designed for the fractional setting. These spaces allow us to reformulate weak solutions in a manner consistent with the fractional dynamics, thereby enabling the successful implementation of a generalized Galerkin scheme. Our formulation not only extends the classical theory but also provides a foundation for the study of broader classes of fractional partial differential equations in fluid mechanics and related areas.</description>

      <title>Global stability analysis of an age-structured model assessing the impact of Radopholus similis on banana-plantain production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and analyse a mathematical model to investigate the interactions between banana and plantain plants and the nematode \textit{Radopholus similis}, a pest species occurring in banana plantations worldwide, with particularly high prevalence in Central Africa. The model incorporates root infection and mortality rates as functions of root age, providing a more realistic representation of the infection dynamics. We prove that the model is well-defined by establishing the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution using the theory of semi-groups for nonlinear evolutionary systems. We further show that the solution is positive and bounded. Under additional assumptions on the regularity of the parameters and the data, we prove that the mild solution is indeed a classical solution. We then study the asymptotic behaviour of the solution by deriving a threshold parameter \(\mathcal{N}\), which determines the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the proposed model using the semi-implicit Euler method. The biological consistency of the numerical solutions is established, and simulations are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results and estimate yield losses caused by nematodes. We conclude the numerical analysis by implementing an impulsive control strategy, which confirms that the use of nematicides - whether chemical or biological - helps to mitigate the devastating effects of nematodes and enhances crop yield.</description>

      <title>Large-time behaviour for coupled systems of Lotka-Volterra-type Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of Fokker-Planck equations recently introduced to describe the temporal evolution of statistical distributions of population densities with predator-prey interactions. At the macroscopic level, the system recovers a Lotka-Volterra model and defines an explicit family of equilibrium densities that depend on the form of the diffusion coefficient. By introducing Energy-type distances, we rigorously establish exponential convergence to equilibrium in appropriate homogeneous Sobolev spaces, with a rate explicitly determined by the dissipative contribution of the interaction term. The analysis highlights the intrinsic energy dissipation mechanism governing the dynamics and clarifies how the evolution of expected quantities determines the emergence of a stable equilibrium configuration. This approach provides a new perspective on the convergence to equilibrium for problems with time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <title>Exponential Decays of Steklov Eigenfunctions for the Magnetic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map $\Lambda_\beta$ associated with the Schr\"odinger operator $(D+\beta \A)^2$ with a magnetic potential in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$, where $\beta&gt;1$ is the field strength parameter. Assume that the magnetic field $\B=\nabla \times \A$ is of finite type. We show that if $\beta&gt;\beta_0$, the ground state for $\Lambda_\beta$ decays exponentially away from a neighborhood of the subset of $\partial\Omega$, on which $\B$ vanishes to the maximal order.</description>

      <title>Segregated Solutions to Critical Elliptic Systems in High Dimensions ($N \geq 5$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of multiple segregated solutions to the critical coupled Schr\"odinger system
  $-\Delta u_1 = K_1(| y|) \lvert u_{1}\rvert^{2^{*}-2}u_{1}+\beta \lvert u_{2}\rvert^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}}\lvert u_{1}\rvert^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}-2}u_{1}, -\Delta u_{2} = K_2(\lvert y\rvert) \lvert u_{2}\rvert^{2^{*}-2}u_{2}+\beta \lvert u_{1}\rvert^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}}\lvert u_{2}\rvert^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}-2}u_{2}, y\in\mathbb R^N, u_{1},u_{2}\geq0,u_{1},u_{2}\in C_{0}(\mathbb R^{N})\cap D^{1,2}(\mathbb R^N),$
  with $N \geq 5$, $2^* = \frac{2N}{N-2}$, radial potentials $K_1, K_2 &gt; 0$,and repulsive coupling $\beta &lt; 0$.Under the assumption that $K_1$ and $K_2$ attain local maxima at distinct radii $r_0 \ne \rho_0$ with precise asymptotic expansions near these points, we prove the existence of infinitely many non-radial segregated solutions $(u_{1,k}, u_{2,k})$ for all sufficiently large integers $k$. These solutions exhibit multiple bumps concentrating on two separate circles of radius $r_0$ and $\rho_0$ respectively. Moreover, each component develops a ``dead core'' near the concentration points of the other. The proof overcomes the sublinear and non-smooth nature of the coupling term ($2^*/2 -1 &lt; 1$) by constructing a tailored complete metric space and combining a finite-dimensional reduction with a novel tail minimization argument.</description>

      <title>Bounded Solutions of Lane-Emden-Fowler system in 2D Exterior Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the Lane-Emden-Fowler sublinear system in two-dimensional exterior domains, motivated by the corresponding scalar cases studied by Constantin (1997) and Yin (2004). Utilizing Liouville transformation, Schauder's fixed point theorem and sub-supersolution method, we establish the existence of bounded positive solutions under suitable conditions on the functions involved. As citations in the papers by Constantin (1997) and Yin (2004) show, this work is the first to consider the system case.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows of Potential Energies in the Geometry of Sinkhorn Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the gradient flow of a potential energy in the space of probability measures when we substitute the optimal transport geometry with a geometry based on Sinkhorn divergences, a debiased version of entropic optimal transport. This gradient flow appears formally as the limit of the minimizing movement scheme, a.k.a. JKO scheme, when the squared Wasserstein distance is substituted by the Sinkhorn divergence. We prove well-posedness and stability of the flow, and that, in the long term, the energy always converges to its minimal value. The analysis is based on a change of variable to study the flow in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, in which the evolution is no longer a gradient flow but described by a monotone operator. Under a restrictive assumption we prove the convergence of our modified JKO scheme towards this flow as the time step vanishes. We also provide numerical illustrations of the intriguing properties of this newly defined gradient flow.</description>

      <title>An improved existence theorem for rigid nonlinearly elastic plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plate is rigid if its admissible displacement fields inducing vanishing two-dimensional strain tensors must vanish. We prove that the nonlinear model of Kirchhoff-Love for such a plate has a solution for any applied forces and boundary conditions. Then we give sufficient conditions on the data ensuring the rigidity of the plate. Together, these results substantially generalize an existence theorem by Rabier whereby the plate is assumed to be clamped on its entire boundary.</description>

      <title>Exponential Lower Bounds for the Advection-Diffusion Equation with Shear Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the $L^2$ norm of spatial mean-free solutions to the advection--diffusion equation on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with shear drifts satisfies an \emph{exponential lower bound} in time. This lower bound shows that diffusion can fundamentally suppress passive-scalar mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a nonlinear dispersive equation which admits a scaling invariance, there may exist self-similar solutions. In this work, we present a systematic approach for the construction of small-amplitude self-similar solutions, together with precise asymptotic descriptions at both small and large frequency scales. These ideas are then applied to three classic dispersive models: the modified Benjamin-Ono, the quartic Korteweg-de Vries and the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>Transition and Stability of 3D MHD Around Couette Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations near Couette flow with a constant magnetic field perpendicular to the shear plane. Couette flow induces mixing and generates magnetic induction, while the constant magnetic field stabilizes $z$-dependent modes. In contrast, the $z$-averaged magnetic field exhibits algebraic growth. Letting $\mu$ denote the inverse fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers, we analyze how $\mu$ governs stability thresholds in Sobolev spaces.
  We identify a nonlinear transient-growth regime characterized by the sharp threshold $5/6\le \gamma\le 1 $. For $x$-average-free initial data of size $\mu^\gamma$, solutions are nonlinearly stable; however, for certain initial data, the solution departs from the linear dynamics at rate $\mu^{\gamma-1}$ due to a first-order nonlinear instability. The exponent $\gamma = 5/6$ is optimal for the associated energy functional and cannot be improved in Sobolev spaces without secondary transient-growth mechanisms. Below this threshold, solutions necessarily transition away from the linear dynamics at a minimal rate.
  As a consequence, the $3d$ results yield sharp Sobolev stability thresholds for the $2d$ MHD equations around Couette flow without a constant magnetic field. In particular, the threshold is strictly larger than in prior $2d$ results with a constant field, revealing destabilizing effects normally suppressed by a constant magnetic field. Crucially, this stabilization is restricted to the direction of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Monokinetic Vlasov-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a microscopic model of spherical particles with inertia in a Stokes flow. As the particle number grows to infinity and their size goes to zero we derive the monokinetic Vlasov-Stokes equations as mean-field limit. We do this under the assumption that the particles have initial velocities given by a Lipschitz velocity profile and prove the mean-field limit for times of the order of the inverse Lipschitz constant. Notably this is not a perturbative result. In particular, we do not require the inertia of the particles to vanish in the limit. Thereby the result improves upon the perturbative derivation in [HS23] in the case of a monokinetic limit density.</description>

We establish sharp $L^p$ bounds for the restriction of Laplace--Beltrami eigenfunctions on $M$ to arbitrary submanifolds contained in a maximal flat, for all $p \ge 2$. The proof combines precise asymptotics of Jacobi polynomials and positivity of Fourier coefficients of spherical functions.</description>

      <title>Some Comparison Results for First-Order Hamilton-Jacobi Equations and Second-Order Fully Nonlinear Parabolic Equations with Ventcell Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01899v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider fully nonlinear, possibly degenerate, parabolic equations associated with Ventcell boundary conditions in bounded or unbounded, smooth domains. We first analyze the exact form of such boundary conditions in general domains in order that the notion of viscosity solutions makes sense. Then we prove general comparison results, both for first- and second-order equations, under rather natural assumptions on the nonlinearities: $(i)$ in the second-order case, the only restrictive assumption is that the equation has to be strictly elliptic in the normal direction, in a neighborhood of the boundary; $(ii)$ in the first-order one, quasiconvexity assumptions have to be imposed both on the equation and the boundary condition, the equation being coercive in the normal direction. Our method is inspired by the ``twin blow-up method'' of Forcadel-Imbert-Monneau, that we adapt to a scaling consistent with the Ventcell boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Qualitative/quantitative homogenization of some non-Newtonian flows in perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the homogenization of stationary and evolutionary incompressible viscous non-Newtonian flows of Carreau-Yasuda type in domains perforated with a large number of periodically distributed small holes in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where the mutual distance between the holes is measured by a small parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and the size of the holes is $\varepsilon^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in (1, 3)$. The Darcy's law is recovered in the limit, thus generalizing the results from https://doi.org/10.1016/0362-546X(94)00285-P and [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jde.2024.08.021] for $\alpha=1$. Instead of using their restriction operator to derive the estimates of the pressure extension by duality, we use the Bogovski\u{\i} type operator in perforated domains (constructed in [https://doi.org/10.1051/cocv/2016016]) to deduce the uniform estimates of the pressure directly. Moreover, quantitative convergence rates are given.</description>

      <title>Complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for positive $(p,p)$-forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for differential $(p,p)$-forms is introduced on compact K\"ahler manifolds. For any $1 \leq p &lt; n$, we show the existence of smooth solutions unique up to adding constants. For $p=1$, this corresponds to the Calabi-Yau theorem proved by S. T. Yau, and for $p=n-1$, this gives the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for $(n-1)$ plurisubharmonic functions studied by Tosatti-Weinkove. For other $p$ values, this defines a non-linear PDE that falls outside of the general framework of Caffarelli-Nirenberg-Spruck. Further, we define a geometric flow for higher-order forms that preserves their cohomology classes, and extends the K\"ahler-Ricci flow naturally to $(p,p)$-forms. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that this flow exists in a maximal time interval and can be shown to converge under some assumptions. A modified flow is introduced and the convergence of the associated normalized flow is shown.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the three-phase Muskat problem with different densities and the same viscosities. The lifespan of the solutions with respect to the width of the strip between interfaces is studied. Indeed, the interfaces are parameterized by the graph of two functions $f(x,t)$ and $g(x,t)$ and we impose that $||f(\cdot,0)-g(\cdot,0)||_{L^\infty}\leq C\sigma$ and $\inf_x |f(\cdot,0)-g(\cdot,0)|\geq c\sigma.$ It is shown, under stronger assumption on $f(x,0)$ and $g(x,0)$, local existence independent of the parameter $\sigma$ (with $\sigma$ small enough). In order to prove such a result, we need to work in analytic spaces.</description>

Abstract: This is an introduction to the analysis of nonlinear evolution equations on manifolds with conical singularities via maximal regularity techniques. We address the specific difficulties due to the singularities, in particular the choice of extensions of the conic Laplacian that guarantee the existence of a bounded $H_\infty$-calculus. We introduce the relevant technical tools and survey, as main examples, applications to the porous medium equation, the fractional porous medium equation, the Yamabe flow, and the Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation of a Passive Scalar Transported by Locally Supported White Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic perturbations of transport type are a common and widely accepted way of representing turbulent effects in fluid dynamics models. In many known examples, it even leads to improved solution theory, a phenomenon known as \emph{regularization by noise}. A common thread in the recent literature on the topic is the so-called \emph{It\^o-Stratonovich diffusion limit}. By selecting Stratonovich transport noise with carefully arranged vector fields, one can show that the solution of certain SPDEs are close, in an appropriate topology, to an effective, deterministic, equation with a new effective second order elliptic operator, linked to the Ito-Stratonovich corrector. In this work, we deal with a passive scalar model with molecular diffusivity $\kappa$. Starting from the results in [Flandoli \emph{et al.}, 2022, \emph{Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. A}, 380(2219)], we consider a transport noise made by a sum of independent and compactly supported vector fields. This setting is relevant for models of stratified turbulence which naturally occur in boundary layers and Boussinesq models. Due to the anisotropic nature of the noise, the identification of the limit equation is not straightforward as in all other examples known in literature, as the Ito-Stratonovich corrector is a generic second order elliptic operator with non-constant coefficients. Using tools from Homogenisation theory, we obtain a representation for the limiting effective diffusivity matrix. Exploiting this representation, we study asymptotics, in the $\kappa \rightarrow 0$ regime, of the effective diffusivity across a number of vector field regimes parametrised by the radius of their support. Finally, we provide a careful numerical analysis of the effective diffusivity, discovering a nonlinear behavior for $\kappa \rightarrow 0$, in some regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the three-dimensional axisymmetric compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary conditions in a cylindrical domain excluding the axis. We establish the global existence and exponential decay of weak, strong, and classical solutions with large initial data and vacuum, under the assumption that the bulk viscosity coefficient is sufficiently large. Moreover, we prove that as the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity, the solutions of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to those of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of initial boundary value problems for 2D compressible MHD equations in domains with corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the well-posedness is studied for the initial boundary value problem of the two-dimensional compressible ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in bounded perfectly conducting domains with corners. The presence of corners yields intrinsic analytic obstacles: the lack of smooth tangential vectors to the boundary prevents the use of classical anisotropic Sobolev spaces, and due to the coupling of normal derivatives near corners, one can not follow the usual way to estimate the normal derivatives of solutions from the equations. To overcome these difficulties, a new class of anisotropic Sobolev spaces $H^m_*(\Omega)$ is introduced to treat corner geometries. Within this framework, the well-posedness theory is obtained for both linear and nonlinear problems of the compressible ideal MHD equations with the impermeable and perfectly conducting boundary conditions. The associated linearized problem is studied in several steps: first one deduces the existence of weak solutions by using a duality argument in high order tangential spaces, then verifies that it is indeed a strong solution by several smoothing procedures preserving traces to get a weak-strong uniqueness result, afterwards the estimates of normal derivatives are obtained by combining the structure of MHD equations with the Helmholtz-type decomposition for both of velocity and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Stable Self-Similar Blow-Up In Nonlinear Wave Equations With Quadratic Time-Derivative Nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study singularity formation in two one-dimensional nonlinear wave models with quadratic time-derivative nonlinearities. The non-null model violates the null condition and typically develops finite-time blow-up; the null-form model is Lorentz-invariant and enjoys small-data global existence, yet still admits blow-up for large data. Building on our earlier work on spatial-derivative nonlinearities, we construct and classify a five-parameter family of generalized self-similar blow-up solutions that captures the observed dynamics. We prove that no smooth exact self-similar profiles exist, while the generalized self-similar solutions -exhibiting logarithmic growth- provide the correct blow-up description inside backward light cones. We further establish asymptotic stability for the relevant branches, including the ODE-type blow-up in both models. These results yield a coherent and unified picture of blow-up mechanisms in time-derivative nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Thom's gradient conjecture for parabolic systems and the Yang-Mills and Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [8], the gradient conjecture of R. Thom was proven for gradient flows of analytic functions on Rn. This result means that the secant at a limit point converges, so that the flow cannot spiral forever. Once the trajectory becomes sufficiently close to a critical point, the flow becomes a simple scaling. Their paper is also significant in the number of auxiliary results they prove about the convergence behaviour of gradient flows, on the way to proving their main result. Many gradient flows of interest occur on infinite dimensional function spaces. And of considerable research interest today are geometric flows with a gauge or diffeomorphism symmetry. We show that the corresponding gradient conjecture holds also for parabolic flows on Hilbert spaces, including flows with a gauge symmetry such as the extensively studied Yang-Mills Flow. The same result also holds for the Ricci flow near any critical point where the assumptions are satisfied, in particular a Fredholm Hessian and a Lojasiewicz inequality with respect to an appropriately chosen functional. This version contains some small improvements on the original 2021 paper.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quasi-planar defects using the Thomas--Fermi--von Weizs\"acker model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of the electron density and relative energy with respect to a perfect crystal of a class of volume defects that are compactly contained along one direction while being of infinite extent along the other two using the Thomas--Fermi--von Weizs\"acker (TFW) model. We take advantage of prior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW setting, and specialize it to the case of quasi-planar defects. In particular, we prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal with respect to a perfect crystal is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization problem. In order to show the existence of the minimization problem, we modify the TFW theory for thin films and establish convergence of the electronic fields due to the perturbation caused by the quasi-planar defect. We also show that perturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the presence of the quasi-planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect, in agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these results to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular the finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical calculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the (non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weizs\"acker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the Dirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of tangent planes and (non-)removable singularities at infinity for collapsed translators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that mean curvature flow translators may exhibit non-removable singularities at infinity, due to jump discontinuities in their asymptotic profiles, and that oscillation can persist so as to yield a continuum of subsequential limit tangent planes. Nonetheless, we prove that as time $t\to\pm \infty$, any finite entropy, finite genus, embedded, collapsed translating soliton in $\mathbb{R}^3$ converges to a uniquely determined collection of planes.
  This requires global analysis of quasilinear soliton equations with non-perturbative drifts, which we analyze via sharp non-standard elliptic decay estimates for the drift Laplacian, implying improvements on the Evans-Spruck and Ecker-Huisken estimates in the soliton setting, and exploiting a link from potential theory of the Yukawa equation to heat flows with $L^\infty$-data on non-compact slice curves of these solitons.
  The structure theorem follows: such solitons decompose at infinity into standard regions asymptotic to planes or grim reaper cylinders. As one application, we classify collapsed translators of entropy two with empty limits as $t\to +\infty$.</description>
