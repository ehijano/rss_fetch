      <title>Sustainable Water Treatment through Fractional-Order Chemostat Modeling with Sliding Memory and Periodic Boundary Conditions: A Mathematical Framework for Clean Water and Sanitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the theoretical properties of a fractional-order chemostat system with sliding memory and periodic boundary conditions, used to model the cultivation of microorganisms for pollutant degradation. By incorporating Caputo fractional derivatives with a sliding memory window (CFDS), the model captures time-dependent behaviors and memory effects in biological systems more effectively than integer-order derivatives. We reduce the two-dimensional fractional differential equations (FDEs) governing substrate and biomass concentrations to a one-dimensional FDE, utilizing periodic boundary conditions. The existence and uniqueness of non-constant periodic solutions are established using the Carath\'eodory framework and fixed-point theorems, ensuring the system's well-posedness. We prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions, demonstrating that substrate concentrations remain within physically meaningful bounds and biomass concentrations stay strictly positive, with solution trajectories confined to a biologically feasible invariant set. Additionally, we analyze non-trivial equilibria under constant dilution rates and derive their stability properties. The results validate the mathematical robustness of the fractional-order chemostat model for periodic bioprocesses, offering a foundation for advanced water treatment technologies and sanitation improvements.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamics of Weighted Composition Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of power-boundedness, Li-Yorke chaos, distributional chaos, absolutely Ces\`aro boundedness and mean Li-Yorke chaos for weighted composition operators on $L^p(\mu)$ spaces and on $C_0(\Omega)$ spaces. We illustrate the general results by presenting several applications to weighted shifts on the classical sequence spaces $c_0(\mathbb{N})$, $c_0(\mathbb{Z})$, $\ell^p(\mathbb{N})$ and $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$ ($1 \leq p &lt; \infty$) and to weighted translation operators on the classical function spaces $C_0[1,\infty)$, $C_0(\mathbb{R})$, $L^p[1,\infty)$ and $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ ($1 \leq p &lt; \infty$).</description>

      <title>Observations on robust diffusive stability and common Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of robust diffusive stability (RDS) for a pair of Schur-stable nonnegative matrices. Specifically, we show that the existence of a common diagonal Lyapunov function is sufficient for RDS and highlight how this condition differs from recently published results based on linear copositive Lyapunov functions. We also present two results on RDS for extended Leslie matrices arising in population dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamics of Invariant Graphs for Dissipative Twist Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two-parameter families of dissipative twist maps, we study the dynamics of invariant graphs and the thresholds of their existence and breakdown. We obtain: (1) For arbitrary $C^1$-small perturbations, invariant graphs with prescribed rotation numbers can be realized through parameter adjustments; (2) The existence of almost sharp perturbations that trigger complete destruction of all invariant graphs; (3) When the perturbation lacks $C^1$-regularity, Lipschitz invariant graphs with non-differentiable points may persist despite the Lipschitz semi-norm satisfying the requirement of the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers linear delay-difference equations, that is, equations relating the state at a given time with its past values over a given bounded interval. After providing a well-posedness result and recalling Hale--Silkowski Criterion for strong stability in the case of equations with finitely many pointwise delays, we propose a generalization of the notion of strong stability to the more general class of linear delay-difference equations with an integral term defined by a matrix-valued measure. Our main result is an extension of Melvin Criterion for the strong stability of scalar equations, showing that local and global strong stability are equivalent, and that they can be characterized in terms of the total variation of the function defining the equation. We also provide numerical illustrations of our main result.</description>

Abstract: We develop categorical foundations of discrete dynamical systems, aimed at understanding how the structure of the system affects its dynamics. The key technical innovation is the notion of a cycle set, which provides a formal language in which to speak of the system's attractors. As a proof of concept, we provide a decomposition theorem for discrete dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Lindblad evolution as gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.</description>

      <title>$J$-class weighted translations on locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bounded linear operator $T$ on a Banach space $X$ (not necessarily separable) is said to be $J$-class operator whenever the extended limit set, say $J_T(x)$ equals $X$ for some vector $x\in X$. Practically, the extended limit sets localize the dynamical behavior of operators. In this paper, using the extended limit sets we will examine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the weighted translation $T_{a,\omega}$ to be $J$-class on a locally compact group $G$, within the setting of $ L^p$-spaces for $ 1 \leq p &lt; \infty $. Precisely, we delineate the boundary between $J$-class and hypercyclic behavior for weighted translations. Then, we will show that for torsion elements in locally compact groups, unlike the case of non-dense orbits of weighted translations, we have $J_{T_{a,\omega}}(0)=L^p(G)$. Finally, we will provide some examples on which the weighted translation $ T_{a,\omega}$ is $J$-class but it fails to be hypercyclic.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff Dimension of non-conical and Myrberg limit sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop techniques to study the Hausdorff dimensions of non-conical and Myrberg limit sets for groups acting on negatively curved spaces. We establish maximality of the Hausdorff dimension of the non-conical limit set of $G$ in the following cases. 1. $M$ is a finite volume complete Riemannian manifold of pinched negative curvature and $G$ is an infinite normal subgroups of infinite index in $\pi_1(M)$. 2. $G$ acts on a regular tree $X$ with $X/G$ infinite and amenable (dimension 1). 3. $G$ acts on the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb H^2$ such that $\mathbb H^2/G$ has Cheeger constant zero (dimension 2). 4. $G$ is a finitely generated geometrically infinite Kleinian group (dimension 3). We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of the Myrberg limit set is the same as the critical exponent, confirming a conjecture of Falk-Matsuzaki.</description>

      <title>Associative Memory and Generative Diffusion in the Zero-noise Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one- and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks (equivalently, the attention mechanism).</description>

      <title>Learning Beyond Experience: Generalizing to Unseen State Space with Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</description>

      <title>Second Order Ensemble Langevin Method for Sampling and Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a sampling method based on an ensemble approximation of second order Langevin dynamics. The log target density is appended with a quadratic term in an auxiliary momentum variable and damped-driven Hamiltonian dynamics introduced; the resulting stochastic differential equation is invariant to the Gibbs measure, with marginal on the position coordinates given by the target. A preconditioner based on covariance under the law of the dynamics does not change this invariance property, and is introduced to accelerate convergence to the Gibbs measure. The resulting mean-field dynamics may be approximated by an ensemble method; this results in a gradient-free and affine-invariant stochastic dynamical system. Numerical results demonstrate its potential as the basis for a numerical sampler in Bayesian inverse problems.</description>

Abstract: Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that linearize nonlinear dynamical systems, facilitating the study of their spectral properties and enabling the prediction of the time evolution of observable quantities. Recent methods have aimed to approximate Koopman operators while preserving key structures. However, approximating Koopman operators typically requires a dictionary of observables to capture the system's behavior in a finite-dimensional subspace. The selection of these functions is often heuristic, may result in the loss of spectral information, and can severely complicate structure preservation. This paper introduces Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition (MultDMD), which enforces the multiplicative structure inherent in the Koopman operator within its finite-dimensional approximation. Leveraging this multiplicative property, we guide the selection of observables and define a constrained optimization problem for the matrix approximation, which can be efficiently solved. MultDMD presents a structured approach to finite-dimensional approximations and can more accurately reflect the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We elaborate on the theoretical framework of MultDMD, detailing its formulation, optimization strategy, and convergence properties. The efficacy of MultDMD is demonstrated through several examples, including the nonlinear pendulum, the Lorenz system, and fluid dynamics data, where we demonstrate its remarkable robustness to noise.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we calculate the metric and folding entropies for a family of non-invertible symbolic dynamical systems $(\Sigma_{m_-,m_+}, \sigma_\phi)$ which generalizes the standard bilateral Bernoulli shifts. The space $\Sigma_{m_-,m_+}$ consists of symbolic sequences over two distinct finite alphabets, with dynamics governed by a shift map $\sigma_\phi$ incorporating a non-invertible function $\phi$ that maps one of the alphabets to the other one. These systems are, for instance, particularly useful for encoding the many-to-one baker's transformation endomorphisms, and they can also be seen as a skew product with a unilateral Bernoulli shift on the base.</description>

Abstract: Koopman operators and transfer operators represent nonlinear dynamics in state space through its induced action on linear spaces of observables and measures, respectively. This framework enables the use of linear operator theory for supervised and unsupervised learning of nonlinear dynamical systems, and has received considerable interest in recent years. Here, we propose a data-driven technique for spectral approximation of Koopman operators of continuous-time, measure-preserving ergodic systems that is asymptotically consistent and makes direct use of known equations of motion (physics). Our approach is based on a bounded transformation of the Koopman generator (an operator implementing directional derivatives of observables along the dynamical flow), followed by smoothing by a Markov semigroup of kernel integral operators. This results in a skew-adjoint, compact operator whose eigendecomposition is expressible as a variational generalized eigenvalue problem. We develop Galerkin methods to solve this eigenvalue problem and study their asymptotic consistency in the large-data limit. A key aspect of these methods is that they are physics-informed, in the sense of making direct use of dynamical vector field information through automatic differentiation of kernel functions. Solutions of the eigenvalue problem reconstruct evolution operators that preserve unitarity of the underlying Koopman group while spectrally converging to it in a suitable limit. In addition, the computed eigenfunctions have representatives in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, enabling out-of-sample evaluation of learned dynamical features. Numerical experiments performed with this method on integrable and chaotic low-dimensional systems demonstrate its efficacy in extracting dynamically coherent observables under complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of pitchfork bifurcations and symmetry breaking in the elliptic restricted three-body problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unified framework is proposed to quantitatively characterize pitchfork bifurcations and associated symmetry breaking in the elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP). It is known that planar/vertical Lyapunov orbits and Lissajous orbits near the collinear libration points undergo pitchfork bifurcations with varying orbital energy. These bifurcations induce symmetry breaking, generating bifurcated families including halo/quasi-halo orbits, axial/quasi-axial orbits, and their corresponding invariant manifolds. Traditional semi-analytical methods for constructing halo orbits, based on resonant bifurcation mechanisms, have obstacles in fully exploiting the intrinsic symmetry breaking characteristics in pitchfork bifurcations. In this paper, a unified trigonometric series-based framework is proposed to analyze these bifurcated families from the perspective of coupling-induced bifurcation mechanisms. By introducing a coupling coefficient and various bifurcation equations into the ERTBP, different symmetry breaking is achieved when the coupling coefficient is non-zero. This unified semi-analytical framework captures bifurcations of both periodic/quasi-periodic and transit/non-transit orbits. Furthermore, it reveals that pitchfork bifurcation solutions in the ERTBP fundamentally depend solely on the orbital eccentricity and three amplitude parameters of the system's degrees of freedom, governing both the elliptic direction and the hyperbolic one.</description>

Abstract: This paper is about topological rigidity of diagonal group actions on the homogeneous $\SL_4\big(\F(\!(t^{-1})\!)\big)/\SL_4(\F[t])$ where $\F$ is a finite field of characteristic $3$. We show that there is a non-closed relatively compact orbit of the diagonal group.</description>

      <title>A noise-induced transition in the Lorenz system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.12815v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic perturbation of the classical Lorenz system in the range of parameters for which the origin is the global attractor. We show that adding noise in the last component causes a transition from a unique to exactly two ergodic invariant measures. The bifurcation threshold depends on the strength of the noise: if the noise is weak, the only invariant measure is Gaussian, while strong enough noise causes the appearance of a second ergodic invariant measure.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Informed Parameter Selection for Improved Soil Moisture Estimation from Remote Sensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the accuracy of soil moisture estimation is required for advancing irrigation scheduling and water conservation efforts. Central to this task are soil hydraulic parameters, which govern moisture dynamics but are rarely known precisely and must therefore be inferred from observational data. In large-scale agricultural fields, estimating the complete set of these parameters is often impractical due to the sparse and noisy nature of available measurements. To address this challenge, this work develops a framework that uses sensitivity analysis and orthogonal projection to identify parameters that are both reliably estimable from available data. These parameters, together with the spatial distribution of soil moisture, are jointly estimated by assimilating observational data into a cylindrical-coordinate version of the Richards equation using an extended Kalman filter. The soil moisture measurements are obtained from microwave remote sensors mounted on center pivot irrigation systems - an emerging and practical technology for capturing field-scale variability. Numerical simulations and field experiments conducted on a large-scale site in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, demonstrate that the proposed method improves soil moisture estimation accuracy by 24-43% and enhances predictive model performance by 50%. Furthermore, the estimated parameters - particularly saturated hydraulic conductivity - exhibit good agreement with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Weak Generative Sampler to Efficiently Sample Invariant Distribution of Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling invariant distributions from an It\^o diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in biased and correlated samples. The current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in the form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from a base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for min-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Our method necessitates neither the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centers related to the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural chemical reaction networks that approximate arbitrary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many important phenomena in biochemistry and biology exploit dynamical features such as multi-stability, oscillations, and chaos. Construction of novel chemical systems with such rich dynamics is a challenging problem central to the fields of synthetic biology and molecular nanotechnology. In this paper, we address this problem by putting forward a molecular version of a recurrent artificial neural network, which we call recurrent neural chemical reaction network (RNCRN). The RNCRN uses a modular architecture - a network of chemical neurons - to approximate arbitrary dynamics. We first prove that with sufficiently many chemical neurons and suitably fast reactions, the RNCRN can be systematically trained to achieve any dynamics. RNCRNs with relatively small number of chemical neurons and a moderate range of reaction rates are then trained to display a variety of biologically-important dynamical features. We also demonstrate that such RNCRNs are experimentally implementable with DNA-strand-displacement technologies.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet improvability in $L_p$-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a norm $F$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$, we consider the set of $F$-Dirichlet improvable numbers $\mathbf{DI}_F$. In the most important case of $F$ being an $L_p$-norm with $p=\infty$, which is a supremum norm, it is well-known that $\mathbf{DI}_F = \mathbf{BA}\cup \mathbb{Q}$, where $\mathbf{BA}$ is a set of badly approximable numbers. It is also known that $\mathbf{BA}$ and each $\mathbf{DI}_F$ are of measure zero and of full Hausdorff dimension.
  Using classification of critical lattices for unit balls in $L_p$, we provide a complete and effective characterization of $\mathbf{DI}_p:=\mathbf{DI}_{F^{[p]}}$ in terms of the occurrence of patterns in regular continued fraction expansions, where $F^{[p]}$ is an $L_p$-norm with $p\in[1,\infty)$. This yields several corollaries. In particular, we resolve two open questions by Kleinbock and Rao by showing that the set $\mathbf{DI}_{p}\setminus \mathbf{BA}$ is of full Hausdorff dimension, as well as proving some results about the size of the difference $\mathbf{DI}_{p_1}\setminus \mathbf{DI}_{p_2}$. To be precise, we show that the set difference of Dirichlet improvable numbers in Euclidean norm ($p=2$) minus Dirichlet improvable numbers in taxicab norm ($p=1$) and vice versa, that is $\mathbf{DI}_{2}\setminus \mathbf{DI}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{DI}_{1}\setminus \mathbf{DI}_{2}$, are of full Hausdorff dimension.
  We also find all values of $p$, for which the set $\mathbf{DI}_p^c\cap\mathbf{BA}$ has full Hausdorff dimension.
  Finally, our characterization result implies that the number $e$ satisfies $e\in \mathbf{DI}_p$ if and only if $p\in(1,2)\cup(p_0,\infty)$ for some special constant $p_0\approx2.57$.</description>

      <title>Bistability and chaos in the discrete two-gene Andrecut-Kauffman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct numerical analysis of the 2-dimensional discrete-time gene expression model originally introduced by Andrecut and Kauffman (Phys. Lett. A 367: 281-287, 2007). In contrast to the previous studies, we analyze the dynamics with different reaction rates $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ for each of the two genes under consideration. We explore bifurcation diagrams for the model with $\alpha_1$ varying in a wide range and $\alpha_2$ fixed. We detect chaotic dynamics by means of the positive maximum Lyapunov exponent and we scan through selected parameters to detect those combinations for which chaotic dynamics can be found in the model. Moreover, we find bistability in the model, that is, the existence of two disjoint attractors. Both situations are interesting from the point of view of applications, as they imply unpredictability of the dynamics encountered. Finally, we show some specific values of parameters of the model in which the two attractors are of different kind (a periodic orbit and a chaotic attractor) or of the same kind (two periodic orbits or two chaotic attractors).</description>

      <title>Age-Structured Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This chapter reviews some aspects of the theory of age-structured models of populations with finite maximum age. We formulate both the renewal equation for the birth rate and the partial differential equation for the age density, and show their equivalence. Next, we define and discuss central concepts in population dynamics, like the basic reproduction number $R_0$, the Malthusian parameter $r$, and the stable age distribution. We briefly review the sun-star theory that turns the birth term into a bounded additive perturbation, thus allowing to develop stability and bifurcation theory along standard lines. Finally, we review the pseudospectral approximation of the infinite-dimensional age-structured models by means of a finite system of ordinary differential equations, which allows to perform numerical bifurcation analysis with existing software tools. Here, Nicholson's blowfly equation serves as a worked example.</description>
