      <title>Optical Chiral Microrobot for Out-of-plane Drilling Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Microrobots (Optobots) have demonstrated a keen interest in various fields including microfluidics, microrobotics, and medicine. Conversely, optomechanics serves as a crucial domain for theoretical exploration into concepts such as chirality, duality, and parity concerning optical forces. In this paper, we elucidate a method to amalgamate chirality through broken axial parity into optobots, thereby augmenting their versatility. Specifically, we illustrate how this integration allows for out-of-plane rotation which helps in their utilization as optical drills under unidirectional excitation achieved through repetitive stimulation of three focal regions: two traps and one chiral rotational site. We fabricate the microrobots employing two-photon lithography, and note a highly satisfactory correspondence between finite element calculations and experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Self-driving lab discovers principles for steering spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an autonomous experimentation platform to accelerate interpretable scientific discovery in ultrafast nanophotonics, targeting a novel method to steer spontaneous emission from reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces. Controlling spontaneous emission is crucial for clean-energy solutions in illumination, thermal radiation engineering, and remote sensing. Despite the potential of reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces with embedded sources for spatiotemporal control, achieving arbitrary far-field control remains challenging. Here, we present a self-driving lab (SDL) platform that addresses this challenge by discovering the governing equations for predicting the far-field emission profile from light-emitting metasurfaces. We discover that both the spatial gradient (grating-like) and the curvature (lens-like) of the local refractive index are key factors in steering spontaneous emission. The SDL employs a machine-learning framework comprising: (1) a variational autoencoder for generating complex spatial refractive index profiles, (2) an active learning agent for guiding experiments with real-time closed-loop feedback, and (3) a neural network-based equation learner to uncover structure-property relationships. The SDL demonstrated a four-fold enhancement in peak emission directivity (up to 77%) over a 72{\deg} field of view within ~300 experiments. Our findings reveal that combinations of positive gratings and lenses are as effective as negative lenses and gratings for all emission angles, offering a novel strategy for controlling spontaneous emission beyond conventional Fourier optics.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optical Switching in a Nonlinear Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear metasurfaces are multifunctional photonic elements that generate and control light, enabling multiple proof-of-principle applications, such as in nonlinear holography, beam shaping, and nanoscale sources of entangled photon pairs. Active tuning of nonlinear metasurfaces will considerably expand their prospects for integrated photonics. Here, we demonstrate a highly-tunable metasurface device that combines electrical and optical switching in a broadband frequency conversion process. Our device employs electrically tunable hybrid graphene-gold plasmons to convert mid-infrared pulses into visible light by optical gating. A strong electrical modulation of the generated visible light is attained for a broad range of mid-infrared input frequencies, and this modulation is up to 3.5x stronger for the metasurface than for plain graphene. All-optical switching measurements indicate that the device can be optically switched at Terahertz rates. Our results may lead to new applications of metasurfaces such as ultrafast signal processing, nonlinear sensing, and optical transduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip lithium niobate micro-disk laser based on hydrogen cyanide (H13C14N) gas saturation absorption method for frequency stabilization. The laser chip consists of two main components: a micro-disk laser and a combined racetrack ring cavity. By operating on the H13C14N P12 absorption line at 1551.3 nm, the laser frequency can be precisely stabilized. The laser demonstrates remarkable stability, achieving a best stability value of 9*10^-9. Furthermore, the short-term stability, evaluated over continuous time intervals of 35 seconds, showcases exceptional performance. Additionally, the residual drift remains well below 30 MHz.</description>

      <title>Topological Dark Spots of Electric Near Field in Metal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric dark spots are point singularities at which the electric field amplitude vanishes. These singularities usually emerge in real space accidentally and are unstable due to the vectorial property of the electric field. In this paper, we show that topologically protected electric dark spots can emerge in metal scatterers under external excitation. The material property of metal imposes a boundary condition that reduces the vectorial electric field on the metal surface to a scalar field. The phase singularity of this scalar field has zero amplitude and carries a well-defined topological charge corresponding to an electric dark spot. The topological electric dark spots give rise to the superoscillation phenomenon with a divergent local wavenumber. We uncover the global charge conservation property of the dark spots on the scatterers' surfaces and demonstrate their stability under different perturbations. We also demonstrate the manipulation of the dark spots' topological charge and spatial location. The results open a new avenue for nanophotonic near-field manipulations and may find applications in optical metrology, optical sensing, and super-resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Unlocking new dimensions in photonic computing using optical Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decline of Moore's law coupled with the growing dominance of artificial intelligence has recently motivated research into photonic computing as a high-bandwidth, low-power strategy to accelerate digital electronics. However, modern-day photonic computing strategies are predominantly analog, making them susceptible to noise and intrinsically difficult to scale. The optical Skyrmion offers a route to overcoming these limitations through digitization in the form of a discrete topological number that can be assigned to the analog optical field. Apart from an intrinsic robustness against perturbations, optical Skyrmions represent a new dimension that has yet to be exploited for photonic computing, namely spatially varying polarization. Here, we propose a method of performing perturbation-resilient integer arithmetic with this new dimension of optical Skyrmions through passive optical components and present experimental evidence demonstrating its feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such discrete mathematical operations have been directly achieved using optical Skyrmions without external energy input.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband thin-film lithium tantalate modulator for high-speed communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous growth of global data traffic over the past three decades, along with advances in disaggregated computing architectures, presents significant challenges for optical transceivers in communication networks and high-performance computing systems. Specifically, there is a growing need to significantly increase data rates while reducing energy consumption and cost. High-performance optical modulators based on materials such as InP, thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3), or plasmonics have been developed, with LiNbO3 excelling in high-speed and low-voltage modulation. Nonetheless, the widespread industrial adoption of thin film LiNbO3 remains compounded by the rather high cost of the underlying 'on insulator' substrates -- in sharp contrast to silicon photonics, which can benefit from strong synergies with high-volume applications in conventional microelectronics. Here, we demonstrate an integrated 110 GHz modulator using thin-film lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) -- a material platform that is already commercially used for millimeter-wave filters and that can hence build upon technological and economic synergies with existing high-volume applications to offer scalable low-cost manufacturing. We show that the LiTaO3 photonic integrated circuit based modulator can support 176 GBd PAM8 transmission at net data rates exceeding 400 Gbit/s, while exhibiting a lower bias drift compared to LiNbO3. Moreover, we show that using silver electrodes can reduce microwave losses compared to previously employed gold electrodes. Our demonstration positions LiTaO3 modulator as a novel and highly promising integration platform for next-generation high-speed, energy-efficient, and cost-effective transceivers.</description>

      <title>Vectorial spatial differentiation of optical beams with metal-dielectric multilayers enabled by spin Hall effect of light and resonant reflection zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically describe and numerically investigate the operation of "vectorial" optical differentiation of a three-dimensional light beam, which consists in simultaneous computation of two partial derivatives of the incident beam profile with respect to two spatial coordinates in different transverse electric field components. It is implemented upon reflection of the beam from a layered structure by simultaneously utilizing the effect of optical resonance and the spin Hall effect of light. As an example of a layered structure performing this operation, we propose a three-layer metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) structure. We show that by choosing the parameters of the MDM structure, it is possible to achieve the so-called isotropic vectorial differentiation, for which the intensity of the reflected optical beam (squared electric field magnitude) is proportional to the squared absolute value of the gradient of the incident linearly polarized beam. The presented numerical simulation results demonstrate high-quality vectorial differentiation and confirm the developed theoretical description.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary-phase locking of fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical interferometers are extensively used in fundamental physics test, gravitational wave detection, quantum metrology, topological photonics, and quantum information processing. Fiber-based interferometers are compact, robust and cheap, thus are ubiquitously deployed. However, the optical phase in fiber interferometers is sensitive to ambient perturbation, resulting in compromised phase sensing precision. Therefore, phase control, shifting and stabilization of fiber interferometers is essential. Methods to create stable interference patterns and to lock a fiber interferometer at arbitrary phase have been shown, which however are sophisticated, bulky and delicate, preventing wider application in harsh environment outside laboratories or in space. Here we demonstrate a new method for arbitrary-phase locking of fiber unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Compared to existing method, our method is simpler, more robust and more compact. We showcase the preparation and characterization of narrow-band energy-time-entanglement photon state generated in integrated nonlinear microresonators, where two-photon interference visibility reaching 0.993(6) is enabled. Our method constitutes a critical building block for photonic quantum network, and is useful to emerging single-photon interference in curved space-time that facilitates exploration of the interface of quantum mechanics and general relativity.</description>

      <title>Designing robust diffractive neural networks with improved transverse shift tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of practically important problems is nowadays efficiently solved using artificial neural networks. This gave momentum to intensive development of their optical implementations, among which, the so-called diffractive neural networks (DNNs) constituted by a set of phase diffractive optical elements (DOEs) attract considerable research interest. In the practical implementation of DNNs, one of the standing problems is the requirement for high positioning accuracy of the DOEs. In this work, we address this problem and propose a method for the design of DNNs for image classification, which takes into account the positioning errors (transverse shifts) of the DNN elements. In the method, the error of solving the classification problem is represented by a functional depending on the phase functions of the DOEs and on random vectors describing their transverse shifts. The mathematical expectation of this functional is used as an error functional in the gradient method for calculating the DNN taking into account the transverse shifts of the DOEs. It is shown that the calculation of the derivatives of this functional corresponds to the DNN training method, in which the DOEs have random transverse shifts. Using the proposed gradient method, DNNs are designed that are robust to transverse shifts of the DOEs and enable solving the problem of classifying handwritten digits at a visible wavelength. Numerical simulations demonstrate good performance of the designed DNNs at transverse shifts of up to 17 wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Sub-milliwatt threshold power and tunable-bias all-optical nonlinear activation function using vanadium dioxide for wavelength-division multiplexing photonic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for efficient hardware in neural computation highlights the limitations of electronic-based systems in terms of speed, energy efficiency, and scalability. Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) photonic neural networks offer a high-bandwidth, low-latency alternative but require effective photonic activation functions. Here, we propose a power-efficient and tunable-bias all-optical nonlinear activation function using vanadium dioxide (VO2) for WDM photonic neural networks. We engineered a SiN/BTO waveguide with a VO2 patch to exploit the phase-change material's reversible insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) for nonlinear activation. We conducted numerical simulations to optimize the waveguide geometry and VO2 parameters, minimizing propagation and coupling losses while achieving a strong nonlinear response and low-threshold activation power. Our proposed device features a sub-milliwatt threshold power, a footprint of 5 $\mu$m, and an ELU-like activation function. Temporal dynamics show a rise time as low as 5 $\mu$s. Moreover, the bias of our device could be thermally tuned, improving the speed and power efficiency. On the other hand, performance evaluations using the CIFAR-10 dataset confirmed the device's potential for convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our results show that a hybrid VO2/SiN/BTO platform could play a prominent role in the path towards the development of high-performance photonic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals heterostructure metasurfaces: atomic-layer assembly of ultrathin optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics has been revolutionized by breakthroughs in optical metasurfaces and layered two-dimensional materials. Yet, integrating these two fields in a singular system has remained challenging. Here, we introduce the concept of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure metasurfaces, where ultrathin multilayer vdW material stacks are shaped into precisely engineered resonant nanostructures for boosting light-matter interactions. By leveraging quasi-bound states in the continuum to create intrinsic cavities from WS$_2$ monolayers encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride, we observe room-temperature strong coupling and polaritonic luminescence, which further unveils a saturation of the strong-coupling regime at ultralow fluences &lt;1 nJ/cm2, more than three orders of magnitude smaller than in previous 2D-cavity systems. Our approach, seamlessly merging metasurfaces and vdW materials, unlocks new avenues for ultrathin optical devices with atomic-scale precision and control.</description>

      <title>Design of diffractive neural networks solving different classification problems at different wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a diffractive neural network (DNN) consisting of a set of sequentially placed phase diffractive optical elements (DOEs) and intended for the optical solution of several given classification problems at different operating wavelengths, so that each classification problem is solved at the corresponding wavelength. The problem of calculating the DNN is formulated as the problem of minimizing a functional that depends on the functions of the diffractive microrelief height of the DOEs constituting the DNN and represents the error in solving the given classification problems at the operating wavelengths. We obtain explicit and compact expressions for the derivatives of this functional and, using them, formulate a gradient method for the DNN calculation. Using this method, we design DNNs for solving the following three classification problems at three different wavelengths: the problem of classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST database, the problem of classifying fashion products from the Fashion MNIST database, and the problem of classifying ten handwritten letters from the EMNIST database. The presented simulation results of the designed DNNs demonstrate high performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Complementary Speckle STED Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy has emerged as a powerful technique providing visualization of biological structures at the molecular level in living samples. In this technique, the diffraction limit is broken by selectively depleting the fluorophore's excited state by stimulated emission, typically using a donut-shaped optical vortex beam. STED microscopy performs unrivalably well in degraded optical conditions such as living tissues. Nevertheless, photo-bleaching and acquisition time are among the main challenges for imaging large volumetric field of views. In this regard, random light beams like speckle patterns have proved to be especially promising for three-dimensional imaging in compressed sensing schemes. Taking advantage of the high spatial density of intrisic optical vortices in speckles -- the most commonly used beam spatial structure used in STED microscopy -- we propose here a novel scheme consisting in performing STED microscopy using speckles. Two speckle patterns are generated at the excitation and the depletion wavelengths, respectively, exhibiting inverted intensity contrasts. We illustrate spatial resolution enhancement using complementary speckles as excitation and depletion beam on both fluorescent beads and biological samples. Our results establish a robust method for super-resolved three-dimensional imaging with promising perspectives in terms of temporal resolution and photobleaching.</description>

      <title>Chiral emission of vortex microlasers enabled by collective modes of guided resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex lasers have attracted substantial attention in recent years owing to their wide array of applications such as micromanipulation, optical multiplexing, and quantum cryptography. In this work, we propose and demonstrate chiral emission of vortex microlaser leveraging the collective modes from omnidirectionally hybridizing the guided mode resonances (GMRs) within photonic crystal (PhC) slabs. Specifically, we encircle a central uniform PhC with a heterogeneous PhC that features a circular lateral boundary. Consequently, the bulk GMRs hybridize into a series of collective modes due to boundary scatterings, resulting in a vortex pattern in real space with a spiral phase front in its radiation. Benefiting from the long lifetime of GMRs as quasi-bound state in the continuum and using asymmetric pumping to lift the chiral symmetry, we demonstrate stable single-mode lasing oscillation with a low optical pumping threshold of $18~\mathrm{kW/cm^2}$ at room temperature. We identify the real-space vortex through polarization-resolved imaging and self-interference patterns, showing a vivid example of applying collective modes to realize compact and energy-efficient vortex microlasers.</description>

      <title>A rectangular loop interferometer for scalar optical computations and controlled generation of higher-order vector vortex modes using spin-orbit interaction of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a rectangular loop interferometer (RLI) that confines light in a rectangular path and facilitates various interesting applications. Such a device can yield the sum of numerous geometric series converging to different values between zero and one by the use of simple intra-cavity beam splitters - both polarization-independent and dependent. Losses - principally due to alignment issues of the beam in the RLI - limit the average accuracy of the series sum value to be between 90 - 98\% with the computation speed determined by the bandwidth of the detectors. In addition, with a circularly polarized input Gaussian beam, and a combination of half-wave plate and q-plate inserted into the interferometer path, the device can generate a vortex beam that carries orbital angular momentum (OAM) of all orders of topological charge. The OAM is generated due to the spin-orbit interaction of light, and the topological charge increases with each successive pass of the beam inside the interferometer. However, experimentally, only the third order of OAM could be measured since projecting out individual orders entailed a slight misalignment of the interferometer, which caused higher orders to go out of resonance. Furthermore, with input linear polarization, the device can generate a vector beam bearing a superposition of polarization states resembling the multipole expansion of a charge distribution. Even here, experimentally, we were able to quantify the polarization distribution up to the third order using a Stokes vector analysis of the vector beam, with the size of the polarization singularity region increasing as the polarization states evolve inside the interferometer. Our work demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of loop interferometers in modifying the scalar and vector properties of light to generate simple mathematical results and other complex but useful applications.</description>

      <title>Phase Symmetry Breaking of Counterpropagating Light in Microresonators for Switches and Logic Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly growing field of integrated photonics is enabling a large number of novel devices for optical data processing, neuromorphic computing and circuits for quantum photonics. While many photonic devices are based on linear optics, nonlinear responses at low threshold power are of high interest for optical switching and computing. In the case of counterpropagating light, nonlinear interactions can be utilized for chip-based isolators and logic gates. In our work we find a symmetry breaking of the phases of counterpropagating light waves in high-Q ring resonators. This abrupt change in the phases can be used for optical switches and logic gates. In addition to our experimental results, we provide theoretical models that describe the phase symmetry breaking of counterpropagating light in ring resonators.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence Diffraction Tomography using Explicit Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the 3D refractive index (RI) from fluorescence images provides both fluorescence and phase information about biological samples. However, accurately retrieving the phase of partially coherent light to reconstruct the unknown RI of label-free phase objects over a large volume, at high resolution, and in reflection mode remains challenging. To tackle this challenge, we developed fluorescence diffraction tomography (FDT) with explicit neural fields that can reconstruct 3D RI from defocused fluorescence speckle images. The successful reconstruction of 3D RI using FDT relies on four key components: coarse-to-fine modeling, self-calibration, a differential multi-slice rendering model, and partial coherent masks. Specifically, the explicit representation efficiently integrates with the coarse-to-fine modeling to achieve high-speed, high-resolution reconstruction. Moreover, we advance the multi-slice equation to differential multi-slice rendering model, which enables the self-calibration method for the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the system. The self-calibration facilitates high accuracy forward image prediction and RI reconstruction. Partial coherent masks are digital masks to resolve the discrepancies between the coherent light model and the partial coherent light data accurately and efficiently. FDT successfully reconstructed the RI of 3D cultured label-free 3D MuSCs tube in a 530 $\times$ 530 $\times$ 300 $\mu m^3$ volume at 1024$\times$1024 pixels across 24 $z$-layers from fluorescence images, demonstrating high fidelity 3D RI reconstruction of bulky and heterogeneous biological samples in vitro.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at avoided crossing near exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to combine two promising research topics in accelerator physics, i.e., optical stochastic cooling (OSC) and steady-state microbunching (SSMB). The motivation is to provide a powerful radiation source which could benefit fundamental science research and industry applications. Our study shows that such a compact OSC-SSMB storage ring using present technology can deliver EUV light with an average power of kilowatt, and spectral flux $&gt;10^{20}$ phs/s/0.1\%b.w., which is four orders of magnitude higher than existing synchrotron sources. It is expected that the presented work is of value for the development of both OSC and SSMB.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum Rabi model for a two-level system coupled to a quantized cavity mode under periodic modulation of the cavity-dipole coupling in the ultrastrong coupling regime, leading to rich Floquet states. As an application of the theory, we show how purely mechanical driving can produce real photons, depending on the strength and frequency of the periodic coupling rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive numerical modelling of microcavity parameters for micropillar lasers with optical pumping was presented. The structure with a hybrid dielectric-semiconductor top mirror has a significantly higher calculated quality-factor (~65000 for 5 $\mu$m pillar) due to better vertical mode confinement. The minimum laser threshold (~370 $\mu$W for 5 $\mu$m pillar) coincided with a temperature of 130 K, which is close to zero gain to cavity detuning. Lasing up to 220 K was demonstrated with a laser threshold of about 2.2 mW.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a variational quantum eigensolver with a solid-state spin system under ambient conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators offer the potential to utilize the quantum nature of a physical system to study another physical system. In contrast to conventional simulation, which experiences an exponential increase in computational complexity, quantum simulation cost increases only linearly with increasing size of the problem, rendering it a promising tool for applications in quantum chemistry. The variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm is a particularly promising application for investigating molecular electronic structures. For its experimental implementation, spin-based solid-state qubits have the advantage of long decoherence time and high-fidelity quantum gates, which can lead to high accuracy in the ground-state finding. This study uses the nitrogen-vacancy-center system in diamond to implement the variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm and successfully finds the eigenvalue of a specific Hamiltonian without the need for error-mitigation techniques. With a fidelity of 98.9% between the converged state and the ideal eigenstate, the demonstration provides an important step toward realizing a scalable quantum simulator in solid-state spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiphoton microscopes employ femtosecond lasers as light sources because the high peak power of the ultrashort pulse allows for multiphoton excitation of fluorescence in the examined sample. However, such short pulses are susceptible to broadening in a microscope's highly dispersive optical elements and require careful dispersion management, otherwise decreasing excitation efficiency. Here, we have developed a 10 nJ Yb:fiber picosecond laser with an integrated pulse picker unit and evaluated its performance in multiphoton microscopy. Our results show that performance comparable to femtosecond pulses can be obtained with picosecond pulses only by reducing the pulse repetition rate and that such pulses are significantly less prone to the effect of chromatic dispersion. These findings proved that the temporal compression of fiber lasers is not always efficient, and it can be omitted by using a smaller and easier-to-use all-fiber setup.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is a valuable resource in quantum information technologies. The practical implementation of entangled photon sources faces obstacles from imperfections and defects inherent in physical systems, resulting in a loss or degradation of entanglement. The topological photonic insulators, however, have emerged as promising candidates, demonstrating an exceptional capability to resist defect-induced scattering, thus enabling the development of robust entangled sources. Despite their inherent advantages, building programmable topologically protected entangled sources remains challenging due to complex device designs and weak material nonlinearity. Here we present a development in entangled photon pair generation achieved through a non-magnetic and tunable anomalous Floquet insulator, utilizing an optical spontaneous four-wave mixing process. We verify the non-classicality and time-energy entanglement of the photons generated by our topological system. Our experiment demonstrates a substantial enhancement in nonclassical photon pair generation compared to devices reliant only on topological edge states. Our result could lead to the development of resilient quantum sources with potential applications in quantum technology.</description>

Abstract: Efficient transfer of quantum information between remote parties is a crucial challenge for quantum communication over atmospheric channels. Random fluctuations of the channel transmittance are a major disturbing factor for its practical implementation. We study correlations between channel transmittances at different moments of time and focus on two transmission protocols. The first is related to the robustness of both discrete- and continuous-variable entanglement between time-separated light pulses, showing a possibility to enlarge the effective dimension of the Hilbert space. The second addresses a selection of high-transmittance events by testing them with bright classical pulses followed by quantum light. Our results show a high capacity of the time-coherence resource for encoding and transferring quantum states of light in atmospheric channels.</description>

      <title>Tunable exciton polaritons in band-gap engineered hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional insulator, when subjected to an external superlattice potential forms a new paradigm for electrostatically tunable excitons in the near- and mid-ultraviolet (UV). The imposed potential has three consequences: (i) it renormalizes the effective mass tensor, leading to anisotropic effective masses; (ii) it renormalizes the band gap, eventually reducing it; (iii) it reduces the exciton binding energies. All these consequences depend on a single dimensionless parameter, which includes the product of strength of the external potential with its period. In addition to the excitonic energy levels, we compute the optical conductivity along two orthogonal directions, and from it the absorption spectrum. The results for the latter show that our system is able to mimic a grid polarizer. These characteristics make one-dimensional hBN superlattices a viable and unexplored platform for fine-tuned polaritonics in the UV to visible spectral range.</description>

      <title>Formation of Highly Tunable Periodic Plasmonic Structures on Gold Films Using Direct Laser Writing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct laser writing method is a promising technique for the large-scale and cost-effective fabrication of periodic nanostructure arrays exciting hybrid lattice plasmons. This type of electromagnetic mode manifests a narrow and deep resonance peak with a high dispersion whose precise controllability is crucial for practical applications in photonic devices. Here, the formation of differently shaped gold nanostructures using the direct laser writing method on Au layers of different thicknesses is presented. The resonance peak is demonstrated to be highly dependent on the shape of the structures in the array, thus its position in the spectra, as well as the quality, can be additionally modulated by changing the morphology. The shape of the structure and the resonance itself pertain not only on the laser pulse energy but also on the grating period. This overlapping effect occurring at distances smaller than the diameter of the focused laser beam is studied in detail. By taking advantage of the highly controllable plasmonic resonance, the fabricated gratings open up new opportunities for applications in sensing.</description>
