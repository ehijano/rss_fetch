      <title>Formalism 25</title>

Abstract: Abraham Robinson's philosophical stance has been the subject of several recent studies. Erhardt following Gaifman claims that Robinson was a finitist, and that there is a tension between his philosophical position and his actual mathematical output. We present evidence in Robinson's writing that he is more accurately described as adhering to the philosophical approach of Formalism. Furthermore, we show that Robinson explicitly argued {against} certain finitist positions in his philosophical writings. There is no tension between Robinson's mathematical work and his philosophy because mathematics and metamathematics are distinct fields: Robinson advocates finitism for metamathematics but no such restriction for mathematics. We show that Erhardt's analysis is marred by historical errors, by routine conflation of the generic and the technical meaning of several key terms, and by a philosophical {parti pris}. Robinson's Formalism remains a viable alternative to mathematical Platonism.</description>

      <title>Musical Chords by the Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mathematics of musical intervals and scales has been extensively studied. Vastly simplified, our ears seem to prefer intervals whose frequency ratios have small numerator and denominator, such as 2:1 (octave), 3:2 (perfect fifth), 4:3 (perfect fourth), and so on. While there also have been numerous studies on the mathematics of musical chords, very few of them consider a model that measures consonance/dissonance of a given chord in analogy with this simple-fractions perspective. Our aim is to develop a measure for the consonance of a chord with crucial symmetry features, including invariance under chord translation, inversion, and interval sets. We apply our model to chords in various musical scales and compare it to existing models and empirical studies.</description>
