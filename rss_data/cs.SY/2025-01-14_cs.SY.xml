      <title>A Comparison of Strategies to Embed Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Formulations Solved via Direct Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to benchmark candidate strategies for embedding neural network (NN) surrogates in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) formulations that are subject to systems described with partial differential equations and that are solved via direct transcription (i.e., simultaneous methods). This study focuses on the use of physics-informed NNs and physics-informed convolutional NNs as the internal (surrogate) models within the NMPC formulation. One strategy embeds NN models as explicit algebraic constraints, leveraging the automatic differentiation (AD) of an algebraic modelling language (AML) to evaluate the derivatives. Alternatively, the solver can be provided with derivatives computed external to the AML via the AD routines of the machine learning environment the NN is trained in. The three numerical experiments considered in this work reveal that replacing mechanistic models with NN surrogates may not always offer computational advantages when smooth activation functions are used in conjunction with a local nonlinear solver (e.g., Ipopt), even with highly nonlinear systems. Moreover, in this context, the external function evaluation of the NN surrogates often outperforms the embedding strategies that rely on explicit algebraic constraints, likely due to the difficulty in initializing the auxiliary variables and constraints introduced by explicit algebraic reformulations.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Optimal Output Tracking for Discrete-Time Multiagent Systems: Stabilizing Policy Iteration Frameworks and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, two model-free optimal output tracking frameworks based on policy iteration for discrete-time multi-agent systems are proposed. First, we establish a framework of stabilizing policy iteration that can start from any initial feedback control policy, relaxing the dependence of traditional policy iteration on the initial stabilizing control policy. Then, another efficient and equivalent $Q$-learning policy iteration framework is developed, which is shown to require only less system data to get the same results as the stabilizing policy iteration. Both frameworks obtain stabilizing control policy by iterating the stabilizing virtual closed-loop system step-by-step to the actual closed-loop system. Multiple explicit schemes for the iteration step-size/coefficient are designed and their stability during the above iterations is analyzed. By using the generated closed-loop stabilizing control policy and two frameworks, the optimal feedback control gain is obtained. The approximate solution of the regulator equations is found by model-free iteration, which leads to the optimal feedforward gain. Finally, the cooperative optimal output tracking is realized by a distributed feedforward-feedback controller. The proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.</description>

      <title>Modeling the residual queue and queue-dependent capacity in a static traffic assignment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The residual queue during a given study period (e.g., peak hour) is an important feature that should be considered when solving a traffic assignment problem under equilibrium for strategic traffic planning. Although studies have focused extensively on static or quasi-dynamic traffic assignment models considering the residual queue, they have failed to capture the situation wherein the equilibrium link flow passing through the link is less than the link physical capacity under congested conditions. To address this critical issue, we introduce a novel static traffic assignment model that explicitly incorporates the residual queue and queue-dependent link capacity. The proposed model ensures that equilibrium link flows remain within the physical capacity bounds, yielding estimations more aligned with data observed by traffic detectors, especially in oversaturated scenarios. A generalized link cost function considering queue-dependent capacity, with an additional queuing delay term is proposed. The queuing delay term represents the added travel cost under congestion, offering a framework wherein conventional static models, both with and without physical capacity constraints, become special cases of our model. Our study rigorously analyzes the mathematical properties of the new model, establishing the theoretical uniqueness of solutions for link flow and residual queue under certain conditions. We also introduce a gradient projection-based alternating minimization algorithm tailored for the proposed model. Numerical examples are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and merit of the proposed model and solution algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Order Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (ILQR) Technique for the Optimal Control of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a reduced order model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach, utilizing the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (ILQR) algorithm for the optimal control of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach proposes a novel modification of the ILQR technique: it uses the Method of Snapshots to identify a reduced order Linear Time Varying (LTV) approximation of the nonlinear PDE dynamics around a current estimate of the optimal trajectory, utilizes the identified LTV model to solve a time-varying reduced order LQR problem to obtain an improved estimate of the optimal trajectory along with a new reduced basis, and iterates till convergence. The convergence behavior of the reduced order approach is analyzed and the algorithm is shown to converge to a limit set that is dependent on the truncation error in the reduction. The proposed approach is tested on the viscous Burger's equation and two phase-field models for microstructure evolution in materials, and the results show that there is a significant reduction in the computational burden over the standard ILQR approach, without significantly sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Analysis-Based Safety Assessment Framework for MASS Route Decision-Making in Restricted Waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the safety of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) navigating in restricted waters, this paper aims to develop a geometric analysis-based route safety assessment (GARSA) framework, specifically designed for their route decision-making in irregularly shaped waterways. Utilizing line and point geometric elements to define waterway boundaries, the framework enables to construct a dynamic width characterization function to quantify spatial safety along intricate waterways. An iterative method is developed to calculate this function, enabling an abstracted spatial property representation of the waterways. Based on this, we introduce a navigational safety index that balances global navigational safety and local risk to determine the safest route. To accommodate ship kinematic constraints, path modifications are applied using a dynamic window approach. A case study in a simulated Port of Hamburg environment shows that GARSA effectively identifies safe routes and avoids the risk of entering narrow waterways in an autonomous manner, thereby prioritizing safety in route decision-making for MASS in confined waters.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Deliverable Energy Flexibility from EV Aggregators in Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a coordinated framework to optimize electric vehicle (EV) charging considering grid constraints and system uncertainties. The proposed framework consists of two optimization models. In particular, the distribution system operator (DSO) solves the first model to optimize the amount of deliverable energy flexibility that can be obtained from EV aggregators. To address the uncertainties of loads and solar energy generation, a hybrid robust/stochastic approach is employed, enabling the transformation of uncertainty-related constraints into a set of equivalent deterministic constraints. Once the DSO has computed the optimal energy flexibility, each aggregator utilizes the second optimization model to optimize the charging schedule for its respective fleet of EVs. Numerical simulations are performed on a modified IEEE 33-bus distribution network to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Enabled Robust Sensor Placement in Cyber-Physical Power Systems: A Graph Diffusion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advancements in physical power systems and network technologies, integrated Cyber-Physical Power Systems (CPPS) have significantly enhanced system monitoring and control efficiency and reliability. This integration, however, introduces complex challenges in designing coherent CPPS, particularly as few studies concurrently address the deployment of physical layers and communication connections in the cyber layer. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a framework for robust sensor placement to optimize anomaly detection in the physical layer and enhance communication resilience in the cyber layer. We model the CPPS as an interdependent network via a graph, allowing for simultaneous consideration of both layers. Then, we adopt the Log-normal Shadowing Path Loss (LNSPL) model to ensure reliable data transmission. Additionally, we leverage the Fiedler value to measure graph resilience against line failures and three anomaly detectors to fortify system safety. However, the optimization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we introduce the Experience Feedback Graph Diffusion (EFGD) algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion process to generate optimal sensor placement strategies. This algorithm incorporates cross-entropy gradient and experience feedback mechanisms to expedite convergence and generate higher reward strategies. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the EFGD algorithm enhances model convergence by 18.9% over existing graph diffusion methods and improves average reward by 22.90% compared to Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) and 19.57% compared to Graph Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO), thereby significantly bolstering the robustness and reliability of CPPS operations.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Gradient-Tracking-Based Distributed Stochastic Optimization over Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new differentially private gradient-tracking-based distributed stochastic optimization algorithm over directed graphs. Specifically, privacy noises are added to each agent's state and tracking variable to prevent information leakage, and then perturbed states and tracking variables are transmitted to neighbors. We design two novel schemes of the iteration step-sizes and the sampling number for the algorithm. By using the sampling parameter-controlled subsampling method, both schemes enhance the differential privacy level, and achieve the finite cumulative privacy budget even over infinite iterations. The convergence rate of the algorithm is shown for both nonconvex with the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition and strongly convex objectives: Scheme (S1) achieves the polynomial convergence rate, and Scheme (S2) achieves the exponential convergence rate. The trade-off between the privacy and the convergence rate is presented. The algorithm's effectiveness and superior performance over the existing works are demonstrated through numerical examples of distributed training on benchmark datasets "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10".</description>

      <title>Optimizing Phase Allocation in Unbalanced Power Distribution Networks using a Linearized DistFlow Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power distribution networks, especially in North America, are often unbalanced but are designed to keep unbalance levels within the limits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards. However, rapid integration of unbalanced devices, such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers and single-phase solar plants, can exacerbate these imbalances. This increase can trigger protection devices, increase losses, and potentially damage devices. To address this issue, phase swapping (or phase allocation) has been proposed. Existing approaches predominantly rely on heuristic methods. In this work, we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach for phase allocation. Our approach uses linearized DistFlow equations to represent the distribution network and incorporates a phase consistency constraint, enforced with binary variables, to ensure that downstream phase configurations align with upstream configurations. We validate the proposed approach on multiple benchmark test cases and demonstrate that it effectively improves network balance, as quantified by various metrics.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Human Activity Recognition with Passive Inter-Body Electrostatic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The passive body-area electrostatic field has recently been aspiringly explored for wearable motion sensing, harnessing its two thrilling characteristics: full-body motion sensitivity and environmental sensitivity, which potentially empowers human activity recognition both independently and jointly from a single sensing front-end and theoretically brings significant competition against traditional inertial sensor that is incapable in environmental variations sensing. While most works focus on exploring the electrostatic field of a single body as the target, this work, for the first time, quantitatively evaluates the mutual effect of inter-body electrostatic fields and its contribution to collaborative activity recognition. A wearable electrostatic field sensing front-end and wrist-worn prototypes are built, and a sixteen-hour, manually annotated dataset is collected, involving an experiment of manipulating objects both independently and collaboratively. A regression model is finally used to recognize the collaborative activities among users. Despite the theoretical advantages of the body electrostatic field, the recognition of both single and collaborative activities shows unanticipated less-competitive recognition performance compared with the accelerometer. However, It is worth mentioning that this novel sensing modality improves the recognition F-score of user collaboration by 16\% in the fusion result of the two wearable motion sensing modalities, demonstrating the potential of bringing body electrostatic field as a complementary power-efficient signal for collaborative activity tracking using wearables.</description>

      <title>Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</description>

      <title>IEEE_TIE25: Analysis and Synthesis of DOb-based Robust Motion Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing a unified state-space design framework, this paper proposes a novel systematic analysis and synthesis method that facilitates the implementation of both conventional zero-order (ZO) and high-order (HO) DObs. Furthermore, this design method supports the development of advanced DObs (e.g., the proposed High-Performance (HP) DOb in this paper), enabling more accurate disturbance estimation and, consequently, enhancing the robust stability and performance of motion control systems. Lyapunov direct method is employed in the discrete-time domain to analyse the stability of the proposed digital robust motion controllers. The analysis demonstrates that the proposed DObs are stable in the sense that the estimation error is uniformly ultimately bounded when subjected to bounded disturbances. Additionally, they are proven to be asymptotically stable under specific disturbance conditions, such as constant disturbances for the ZO and HP DObs. Stability constraints on the design parameters of the DObs are analytically derived, providing effective synthesis tools for the implementation of the digital robust motion controllers. The discrete-time analysis facilitates the derivation of more practical design constraints. The proposed analysis and synthesis methods have been rigorously validated through experimental evaluations, confirming their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Erasing Noise in Signal Detection with Diffusion Model: From Theory to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a signal detection method based on the denoise diffusion model (DM) is proposed, which outperforms the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method that has long been regarded as the optimal signal detection technique. Theoretically, a novel mathematical theory for intelligent signal detection based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is established in this paper, demonstrating the effectiveness of DM in reducing the additive white Gaussian noise in received signals. Moreover, a mathematical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the timestep in DM is established, revealing that for any given SNR, a corresponding optimal timestep can be identified. Furthermore, to address potential issues with out-of-distribution inputs in the DM, we employ a mathematical scaling technique that allows the trained DM to handle signal detection across a wide range of SNRs without any fine-tuning. Building on the above theoretical foundation, we propose a DM-based signal detection method, with the diffusion transformer (DiT) serving as the backbone neural network, whose computational complexity of this method is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Simulation results demonstrate that, for BPSK and QAM modulation schemes, the DM-based method achieves a significantly lower symbol error rate (SER) compared to ML estimation, while maintaining a much lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>A Federated Deep Learning Framework for Cell-Free RSMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are poised to benefit significantly from the integration of three key technologies (KTs): Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), cell-free architectures, and federated learning. Each of these technologies offers distinct advantages in terms of security, robustness, and distributed structure. In this paper, we propose a novel cell-free network architecture that incorporates RSMA and employs machine learning techniques within a federated framework. This combination leverages the strengths of each KT, creating a synergistic effect that maximizes the benefits of security, robustness, and distributed structure. We formally formulate the access point (AP) selection and precoder design for max-min rate optimization in a cell-free MIMO RSMA network. Our proposed solution scheme involves a three-block procedure. The first block trains deep reinforcement learning (DRL) neural networks to obtain RSMA precoders, assuming full connectivity between APs and user equipments (UEs). The second block uses these precoders and principal component analysis (PCA) to assign APs to UEs by removing a subset of AP-UE connections. The final block fine-tunes the RSMA precoders by incorporating the associated APs into a second DRL network. To leverage the distributed nature of the cell-free network, this process is implemented in a Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) structure operating through the cooperation of APs and a central processing unit (CPU). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FDRL approach performs comparably to a benchmark centralized DRL scheme. Our FDRL approach, provides a balanced trade-off, maintaining high performance with enhanced security and reduced processing demands.</description>

      <title>Real-time Mode-Aware Dataflow: A Dataflow Model to Specify and Analyze Mode-dependent CPSs under Relaxed Timing Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) often exhibit both relaxed real-time constraints and a mode-dependent execution. Relaxed real-time constraints mean that only a subset of the processes of a CPS have real-time constraints, and a mode-dependent CPS has conditional execution branches. Static analysis tools, such as the PolyGraph model (a formalism extending the Cyclo-Static Dataflow model with real-time constraints), can specify and analyze systems with relaxed real-time constraints. However, PolyGraph is limited in its ability to specify and analyze mode-dependent CPSs. This paper extends PolyGraph with routing actors, yielding the Routed PolyGraph model. This model is further extended to the Real-time Mode-Aware Dataflow (RMDF), which both leverages routing actors and incorporates a new dataflow actor to specify mode-dependent CPSs under relaxed real-time constraints. This paper also extends the static analyses of PolyGraph to RMDF. We showcase the application of RMDF with a specification and an analysis (derivation of timing constraints at the job-level and a feasibility test) of the vision processing system of the Ingenuity Mars helicopter.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine-learning for predicting molecular weight of PLA based on artificial bee colony optimization algorithm and adaptive neurofuzzy inference system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses the integration of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm with two supervised learning methods, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), for feature selection from Near-Infrared (NIR) spectra for predicting the molecular weight of medical-grade Polylactic Acid (PLA). During extrusion processing of PLA, in-line NIR spectra were captured along with extrusion process and machine setting data. With a dataset comprising 63 observations and 512 input features, appropriate machine learning tools are essential for interpreting data and selecting features to improve prediction accuracy. Initially, the ABC optimization algorithm is coupled with ANN/ANFIS to forecast PLA molecular weight. The objective functions of the ABC algorithm are to minimize the root mean square error (RMSE) between experimental and predicted PLA molecular weights while also minimizing the number of input features. Results indicate that employing ABC-ANFIS yields the lowest RMSE of 282 Da and identifies four significant parameters (NIR wavenumbers 6158 cm-1, 6310 cm-1, 6349 cm-1, and melt temperature) for prediction. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using the ABC algorithm with ANFIS for selecting a minimal set of features to predict PLA molecular weight with high accuracy during processing</description>

      <title>An Extended Survey and a Comparison Framework for Dataflow Models of Computation and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataflow Model of Computation and Communications (DF MoCCs) is a formalism used to specify the behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). DF MoCCs are widely used in the design of CPSs, as they provide a high-level of abstraction to specify the system's behavior. DF MoCCs rules give semantics to a dataflow specification of a CPS, and static analysis algorithms rely on these semantics to guarantee safety properties of the dataflow specification, such as bounded memory usage and deadlock freeness. A wide range of DF MoCCs exists, each with its own characteristics and static analyses. This paper presents a survey of those DF MoCCs and a classification in eight categories. In addition, DF MoCCs are characterized by a comprehensive list of features and static analyses, which reflect their expressiveness and analyzability. Based on this characterization, a framework is proposed to compare the expressiveness and the analyzability of DF MoCCs quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Computing Safety Margins of Parameterized Nonlinear Systems for Vulnerability Assessment via Trajectory Sensitivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical systems experience nonlinear disturbances which have the potential to disrupt desired behavior. For a particular disturbance, whether or not the system recovers from the disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on system parameter values, which are typically uncertain and time-varying. Therefore, to quantify proximity to vulnerability we define the safety margin to be the smallest change in parameter values from a nominal value such that the system will no longer be able to recover from the disturbance. Safety margins are valuable but challenging to compute as related methods, such as those for robust region of attraction estimation, are often either overly conservative or computationally intractable for high dimensional systems. Recently, we developed algorithms to compute safety margins efficiently and non-conservatively by exploiting the large sensitivity of the system trajectory near the region of attraction boundary to small perturbations. Although these algorithms have enjoyed empirical success, they lack theoretical guarantees that would ensure their generalizability. This work develops a novel characterization of safety margins in terms of trajectory sensitivities, and uses this to derive well-posedness and convergence guarantees for these algorithms, enabling their generalizability and successful application to a large class of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Determining Disturbance Recovery Conditions by Inverse Sensitivity Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems naturally experience disturbances, some of which can damage equipment and disrupt consumers. It is important to quickly assess the likely consequences of credible disturbances and take preventive action, if necessary. However, assessing the impact of potential disturbances is challenging because many of the influential factors, such as loading patterns, controller settings and load dynamics, are not precisely known. To address this issue, the paper introduces the concept of parameter-space recovery regions. For each disturbance, the corresponding recovery region is the region of parameter space for which the system will recover to the desired operating point. The boundary of the recovery region establishes the separation between parameter values that result in trouble-free recovery and those that incur undesirable non-recovery. The safety margin for a given set of parameter values is defined as the smallest distance (in parameter space) between the given values and the recovery boundary. Novel numerical algorithms with theoretical guarantees are presented for efficiently computing recovery boundaries and safety margins. Unlike prior methods, which tend to be overly conservative and restricted to low dimensional parameter space, these methods compute safety margins to arbitrary user-specified accuracy and do so efficiently in high dimensional parameter space. The efficacy of the methods is demonstrated using the IEEE 39-bus benchmark power system, where safety margins are computed for cases that consider up to 86 parameters, and reveal unexpected safety implications that would not have been observed otherwise.</description>

      <title>Event Constrained Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present event constraints as a new modeling paradigm that generalizes joint chance constraints from stochastic optimization to (1) enforce a constraint on the probability of satisfying a set of constraints aggregated via application-specific logic (constituting an event) and (2) to be applied to general infinite-dimensional optimization (InfiniteOpt) problems (i.e., time, space, and/or uncertainty domains). This new constraint class offers significant modeling flexibility in posing InfiniteOpt constraints that are enforced over a certain portion of their domain (e.g., to a certain probability level), but can be challenging to reformulate/solve due to difficulties in representing arbitrary logical conditions and specifying a probabilistic measure on a collection of constraints. To address these challenges, we derive a generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) representation of event constrained optimization problems, which readily enables us to pose logical event conditions in a standard form and allows us to draw from a suite of GDP solution strategies that leverage the special structure of this problem class. We also extend several approximation techniques from the chance constraint literature to provide a means to reformulate certain event constraints without the use of binary variables. We illustrate these findings with case studies in stochastic optimal power flow, dynamic disease control, and optimal 2D diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study emphasizes the domain of requirements engineering by applying the SMOTE-Tomek preprocessing technique, combined with stratified K-fold cross-validation, to address class imbalance in the PROMISE dataset. This dataset comprises 969 categorized requirements, classified into functional and non-functional types. The proposed approach enhances the representation of minority classes while maintaining the integrity of validation folds, leading to a notable improvement in classification accuracy. Logistic regression achieved 76.16\%, significantly surpassing the baseline of 58.31\%.

      <title>Safe Circumnavigation of a Hostile Target Using Range-Based Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic systems are frequently deployed in missions that are dull, dirty, and dangerous, where ensuring their safety is of paramount importance when designing stabilizing controllers to achieve their desired goals. This paper addresses the problem of safe circumnavigation around a hostile target by a nonholonomic robot, with the objective of maintaining a desired safe distance from the target. Our solution approach involves incorporating an auxiliary circle into the problem formulation, which assists in navigating the robot around the target using available range-based measurements. By leveraging the concept of a barrier Lyapunov function, we propose a novel control law that ensures stable circumnavigation around the target while preventing the robot from entering the safety circle. This controller is designed based on a parameter that depends on the radii of three circles, namely the stabilizing circle, the auxiliary circle, and the safety circle. By identifying an appropriate range for this design parameter, we rigorously prove the stability of the desired equilibrium of the closed-loop system. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the robot's motion within the auxiliary circle, which is influenced by a gain parameter in the proposed controller. Simulation and experimental results are presented to illustrate the key theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>When xURLLC Meets NOMA: A Stochastic Network Calculus Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC) presents stringent and unprecedented requirements for key performance indicators (KPIs). As a disruptive technology, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) harbors the potential to fulfill these stringent KPIs essential for xURLLC. However, the immaturity of research on the tail distributions of these KPIs significantly impedes the application of NOMA to xURLLC. Stochastic network calculus (SNC), as a potent methodology, is leveraged to provide dependable theoretical insights into tail distribution analysis and statistical QoS provisioning (SQP). In this article, we develop a NOMA-assisted uplink xURLLC network architecture that incorporates an SNC-based SQP theoretical framework (SNC-SQP) to support tail distribution analysis in terms of delay, age-of-information (AoI), and reliability. Based on SNC-SQP, an SQP-driven power optimization problem is proposed to minimize transmit power while guaranteeing xURLLC's KPIs on delay, AoI, reliability, and power consumption. Extensive simulations validate our proposed theoretical framework and demonstrate that the proposed power allocation scheme significantly reduces uplink transmit power and outperforms conventional schemes in terms of SQP performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Cooperative Aerial Robot Inspection Challenge (CARIC), a simulation-based benchmark for motion planning algorithms in heterogeneous multi-UAV systems. CARIC features UAV teams with complementary sensors, realistic constraints, and evaluation metrics prioritizing inspection quality and efficiency. It offers a ready-to-use perception-control software stack and diverse scenarios to support the development and evaluation of task allocation and motion planning algorithms. Competitions using CARIC were held at IEEE CDC 2023 and the IROS 2024 Workshop on Multi-Robot Perception and Navigation, attracting innovative solutions from research teams worldwide. This paper examines the top three teams from CDC 2023, analyzing their exploration, inspection, and task allocation strategies while drawing insights into their performance across scenarios. The results highlight the task's complexity and suggest promising directions for future research in cooperative multi-UAV systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing wheel loader performance: an end-to-end approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wheel loaders in mines and construction sites repeatedly load soil from a pile to load receivers. This task presents a challenging optimization problem since each loading's performance depends on the pile state, which depends on previous loadings. We investigate an end-to-end optimization approach considering future loading outcomes and V-cycle transportation costs. To predict the evolution of the pile state and the loading performance, we use world models that leverage deep neural networks trained on numerous simulated loading cycles. A look-ahead tree search optimizes the sequence of loading actions by evaluating the performance of thousands of action candidates, which expand into subsequent action candidates under the predicted pile states recursively. Test results demonstrate that, over a horizon of 15 sequential loadings, the look-ahead tree search is 6% more efficient than a greedy strategy, which always selects the action that maximizes the current single loading performance, and 14% more efficient than using a fixed loading controller optimized for the nominal case.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Sampling-based Planner with LTL Constraints and Text Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project introduces a hierarchical planner integrating Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) constraints with natural language prompting for robot motion planning. The framework decomposes maps into regions, generates directed graphs, and converts them into transition systems for high-level planning. Text instructions are translated into LTL formulas and converted to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for sequential goal-reaching tasks while adhering to safety constraints. High-level plans, derived via Breadth-First Search (BFS), guide low-level planners like Exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) for obstacle-avoidant navigation along with LTL tasks. The approach demonstrates adaptability to various task complexities, though challenges such as graph construction overhead and suboptimal path generation remain. Future directions include extending to considering terrain conditions and incorporating higher-order dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cost-effective robotic handwriting system designed to replicate human-like handwriting with high precision. Combining a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, 3D-printed components, and a machine learning-based handwriting generation model implemented via TensorFlow.js, the system converts user-supplied text into realistic stroke trajectories. By leveraging lightweight 3D-printed materials and efficient mechanical designs, the system achieves a total hardware cost of approximately \$56, significantly undercutting commercial alternatives. Experimental evaluations demonstrate handwriting precision within $\pm$0.3 millimeters and a writing speed of approximately 200 mm/min, positioning the system as a viable solution for educational, research, and assistive applications. This study seeks to lower the barriers to personalized handwriting technologies, making them accessible to a broader audience.</description>

      <title>TensorConvolutionPlus: A python package for distribution system flexibility area estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power system operators need new, efficient operational tools to use the flexibility of distributed resources and deal with the challenges of highly uncertain and variable power systems. Transmission system operators can consider the available flexibility in distribution systems (DSs) without breaching the DS constraints through flexibility areas. However, there is an absence of open-source packages for flexibility area estimation. This paper introduces TensorConvolutionPlus, a user-friendly Python-based package for flexibility area estimation.

      <title>Optimization with Multi-sourced Reference Information and Unknown Trust: A Distributionally Robust Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In problems that involve input parameter information gathered from multiple data sources with varying reliability, incorporating users' trust about different sources in decision-optimization models can potentially improve solution performance and reliability. In this work, we propose a novel multi-reference distributionally robust optimization (MR-DRO) framework, where the model inputs are uncertain and their probability distributions can be statistically inferred from multiple data sources. Via nonparametric data fusion, we construct a Wasserstein ambiguity set to minimize the worst-case expected value of a stochastic objective function, accounting for both uncertainty and unknown reliability of information sources. We reformulate the MR-DRO model as a linear program given linear objective and constraints in the original problem. We also incorporate a dynamic trust update mechanism that adjusts the trust for each source based on its performance over time. In addition, we introduce the concept of probability dominance to identify sources with dominant trust. Via solving instances of resource allocation and portfolio optimization, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the trust-informed MR-DRO approach compared to traditional optimization frameworks relying on a single data source. Our results highlight the significance of integrating (dynamic) user trust in decision making under uncertainty, particularly when given diverse and potentially conflicting input data.</description>

      <title>Implementing LoRa MIMO System for Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bandwidth constraints limit LoRa implementations. Contemporary IoT applications require higher throughput than that provided by LoRa. This work introduces a LoRa Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system and a spatial multiplexing algorithm to address LoRa's bandwidth limitation. The transceivers in the proposed approach modulate the signals on distinct frequencies of the same LoRa band. A Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) method is used at the transmitters to provide a wider MIMO channel. Unlike conventional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) techniques, this work exploits the orthogonality of the LoRa signals facilitated by its proprietary Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation to perform an OFDM in the proposed LoRa MIMO system. By varying the Spreading Factor (SF) and bandwidth of LoRa signals, orthogonal signals can transmit on the same frequency irrespective of the FDM. Even though the channel correlation is minimal for different spreading factors and bandwidths, different Carrier Frequencies (CF) ensure the signals do not overlap and provide additional degrees of freedom. This work assesses the proposed model's performance and conducts an extensive analysis to provide an overview of resources consumed by the proposed system. Finally, this work provides the detailed results of a thorough evaluation of the model on test hardware.</description>

Abstract: Advances in vitreoretinal robotic surgery enable precise techniques for gene therapies. This study evaluates three robotic approaches using the 7-DoF robotic arm for docking a micro-precise tool to a trocar: fully co-manipulated, hybrid co-manipulated/teleoperated, and hybrid with camera assistance. The fully co-manipulated approach was the fastest but had a 42% success rate. Hybrid methods showed higher success rates (91.6% and 100%) and completed tasks within 2 minutes. NASA Task Load Index (TLX) assessments indicated lower physical demand and effort for hybrid approaches.</description>

      <title>A Linear Parameter-Varying Framework for the Analysis of Time-Varying Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a framework to analyze iterative first-order optimization algorithms for time-varying convex optimization. We assume that the temporal variability is caused by a time-varying parameter entering the objective, which can be measured at the time of decision but whose future values are unknown. We consider the case of strongly convex objective functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients and address the class of running algorithms where only one iteration per time change is performed. We model these algorithms as discrete-time linear parameter varying (LPV) systems in feedback with a time-varying gradient. We leverage the approach of analyzing algorithms as uncertain control interconnections with integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) and generalize that framework to the time-varying case. We propose novel IQCs that are capable of capturing the behavior of time-varying nonlinearities and leverage techniques from the LPV literature to establish novel bounds on the tracking error. Quantitative bounds can be computed by solving a semi-definite program and can be interpreted as an input-to-state stability result with respect to a disturbance signal which increases with the temporal variability of the problem. As a departure from results in this research area, our bounds introduce terms that can be interpreted as a temporal rate of change in the cost function and the optimal value. We exemplify our main results with numerical experiments that showcase how our analysis framework is able to capture convergence rates of different first-order algorithms for time-varying optimization through the choice of IQC and rate bounds.</description>

      <title>Encrypted Computation of Collision Probability for Secure Satellite Conjunction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of collision probability ($\mathcal{P}_c$) is crucial for space environmentalism and sustainability by providing decision-making knowledge that can prevent collisions between anthropogenic space objects. However, the accuracy and precision of $\mathcal{P}_c$ computations is often compromised by limitations in computational resources and data availability. While significant improvements have been made in the computational aspects, the rising concerns regarding the privacy of collaborative data sharing can be a major limiting factor in the future conjunction analysis and risk assessment, especially as the space environment grows increasingly privatized, competitive, and fraught with conflicting strategic interests. This paper argues that the importance of privacy measures in space situational awareness (SSA) is underappreciated, and regulatory and compliance measures currently in place are not sufficient by themselves, presenting a significant gap.
  To address this gap, we introduce a novel encrypted architecture that leverages advanced cryptographic techniques, including homomorphic encryption (HE) and multi-party computation (MPC), to safeguard the privacy of entities computing space sustainability metrics, inter alia, $\mathcal{P}_c$. Our proposed protocol, Encrypted $\mathcal{P}_c$, integrates the Monte Carlo estimation algorithm with cryptographic solutions, enabling secure collision probability computation without exposing sensitive or proprietary information. This research advances secure conjunction analysis by developing a secure MPC protocol for $\mathcal{P}_c$ computation and highlights the need for innovative protocols to ensure a more secure and cooperative SSA landscape.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin for Smart Societies: A Catalyst for Inclusive and Accessible Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With rapid digitization and digitalization, drawing a fine line between the digital and the physical world has become nearly impossible. It has become essential more than ever to integrate all spheres of life into a single Digital Thread to address pressing challenges of modern society: accessible and inclusive healthcare in terms of equality and equity. Techno-social advancements and mutual acceptance have enabled the infusion of digital models to simulate social settings with minimum resource utilization to make effective decisions. However, a significant gap exists in feeding back the models with appropriate real-time changes. In other words, active behavioral modeling of modern society is lacking, influencing community healthcare as a whole. By creating virtual replicas of (physical) behavioral systems, digital twins can enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of urban dynamics. This paper explores the potential of digital twins to promote inclusive healthcare for evolving smart cities. We argue that digital twins can be used to: Identify and address disparities in access to healthcare services, Facilitate community participation, Simulate the impact of urban policies and interventions on different groups of people, and Aid policy-making bodies for better access to healthcare. This paper proposes several ways to use digital twins to stitch the actual and virtual societies. Several discussed concepts within this framework envision an active, integrated, and synchronized community aware of data privacy and security. The proposal also provides high-level step-wise transitions that will enable this transformation.</description>

      <title>Proactive Distributed Emergency Response with Heterogeneous Tasks Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, traffic incident management (TIM) programs coordinate the deployment of emergency resources to immediate incident requests without accommodating the interdependencies on incident evolutions in the environment. However, ignoring inherent interdependencies on the evolution of incidents in the environment while making current deployment decisions is shortsighted, and the resulting naive deployment strategy can significantly worsen the overall incident delay impact on the network. The interdependencies on incident evolution in the environment, including those between incident occurrences, and those between resource availability in near-future requests and the anticipated duration of the immediate incident request, should be considered through a look-ahead model when making current-stage deployment decisions. This study develops a new proactive framework based on the distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) to address the above limitations, overcoming conventional TIM models that cannot accommodate the dependencies in the TIM problem. Furthermore, the optimization objective is formulated to incorporate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs' role in TIM includes exploring uncertain traffic conditions, detecting unexpected events, and augmenting information from roadway traffic sensors. Robustness analysis of our model for multiple TIM scenarios shows satisfactory performance using local search exploration heuristics. Overall, our model reports a significant reduction in total incident delay compared to conventional TIM models. With UAV support, we demonstrate a further decrease in the total incident delay ranging between 5% and 45% for the different number of incidents. UAV's active sensing can shorten response time of emergency vehicles, and a reduction in uncertainties associated with the estimated incident delay impact.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of Frequency Distribution in Power Systems: Sources, Estimation, Impact and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyses an emerging real-world phenomena in inverter-based renewable-dominated power systems, namely, asymmetry of frequency distribution. The paper first provides a rationale on why asymmetry reduces the "quality" of the frequency control and system operation. Then it provides qualitative theoretical insights that explain asymmetry in terms of the nonlinearity of real-world power systems and associated models. In particular network losses and pitch angle-based frequency control of wind power plants are discussed. Then the paper proposes a nonlinear compensation control to reduce the asymmetry as well as a statistical metric based on the frequency probability distribution to quantify the level of asymmetry in a power system. Real-world data obtained from the Irish and Australian transmission systems serve to support the theoretical appraisal, whereas simulations based on an IEEE benchmark system show the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear compensation. The case study also shows that, while automatic generation control reduces asymmetry, frequency control limits and droop-based frequency support provided by wind generation using a tight deadband of 15 mHz, namely active power control, leads to a significant increase in the asymmetry of the frequency probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Relaxation based Non-Conservative Chance Constrained Stochastic MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chance constrained stochastic model predictive controllers (CC-SMPC) trade off full constraint satisfaction for economical plant performance under uncertainty. Previous CC-SMPC works are over-conservative in constraint violations leading to worse economic performance. Other past works require a-priori information about the uncertainty set, limiting their application. This paper considers a discrete LTI system with hard constraints on inputs and chance constraints on states, with unknown uncertainty distribution, statistics, or samples. This work proposes a novel adaptive online update rule to relax the state constraints based on the time-average of past constraint violations, to achieve reduced conservativeness in closed-loop. Under an ideal control policy assumption, it is proven that the time-average of constraint violations asymptotically converges to the maximum allowed violation probability. The method is applied for optimal battery energy storage system (BESS) dispatch in a grid connected microgrid with PV generation and load demand, with chance constraints on BESS state-of-charge (SOC). Realistic simulations show the superior electricity cost saving potential of the proposed method as compared to the traditional economic MPC without chance constraints, and a state-of-the-art approach with chance constraints. We satisfy the chance constraints non-conservatively in closed-loop, effectively trading off increased cost savings with minimal adverse effects on BESS lifetime.</description>

      <title>Cost-optimized probabilistic maintenance for condition monitoring of wind turbines with rare failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method, a model, and a form of presenting model results for condition monitoring of a small set of wind turbines with rare failures. The main new ingredient of the method is to sample failure thresholds according to the profit they give to an operating company. The model is a multiple linear regression with seasonal components and external regressors, representing all sensor components except for the selected one. To overcome the scarcity of the training data, we use the median sensor values from all available turbines in their healthy state. The cumulated deviation from the normal behavior model obtained for this median turbine is calibrated for each turbine at the beginning of the test period and after known failures. The proposed form of presenting results is to set a scale for possible costs, control for random maintenance, and show a whole distribution of costs depending on the free model parameters. We make a case study on an open dataset with SCADA data from multiple sensors and show that considering the influence of turbine components is more critical than seasonality. The distribution, the average, and the standard deviation of maintenance costs can be very different for similar minimal costs. Random maintenance can be more profitable than reactive maintenance and other approaches. Our predictive maintenance model outperforms random maintenance and competitors for the whole set of considered turbines, giving substantial savings.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the key factors that enable early failure forecasting in wind turbines. For this purpose, we analyze studies with long-term forecasts and compare their main features: prediction time, methods, targeted components, dataset size, and check the effect of using additional sensors. We found that the size of the dataset is the main factor and that an approximate linear scaling holds: the number of forecast days is twice the size of the dataset, measured in turbine years. We also observe that the data allow us to quantify the meaning of "big" and "long" in the terms "big data" and "long-term" forecasts, which are found to be ten turbine years and two weeks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning-Based Two-Stage Unit Commitment Framework for Enhanced Power Systems Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The volatility of renewable energy sources and fluctuations in real-time electricity demand present significant challenges to traditional unit commitment (UC) methods, often causing system constraint violations. Conventional optimization algorithms face substantial difficulties in responding quickly to these variations, frequently requiring the relaxation of constraints or producing infeasible solutions. To address these challenges, a robust two-stage UC framework based on quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) is proposed in this work, which improves both decision-making speed and solution feasibility. In the first stage, the day-ahead scheduling of thermal generators is optimized. In the second stage, real-time adjustments are made to account for changes in renewable generation and load, with microgrids integrated to reduce the impact of uncertainties on the power system. Both stages are formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs), and QRL is used to efficiently solve the problem. QRL provides key advantages, including more effective navigation of the high-dimensional solution space and faster convergence compared to classical methods, thus enhancing the robustness and computational efficiency of UC operations. The proposed QRL-based two-stage UC framework is validated using the IEEE RTS 24-bus system. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing improved solution feasibility and computational speed compared to conventional UC methods.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Actor-Critic: An Evolutionary Framework for Sequential Decision Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12518v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown promise in solving sequential decision problems (SDPs) by simplifying them to static optimization problems and searching for the optimal policy parameters in a zeroth-order way. While these methods are highly versatile, they often suffer from high sample complexity due to their ignorance of the underlying temporal structures. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) methods typically formulate SDPs as Markov Decision Process (MDP). Although more sample efficient than EAs, RL methods are restricted to differentiable policies and prone to getting stuck in local optima. To address these issues, we propose a novel evolutionary framework Zeroth-Order Actor-Critic (ZOAC). We propose to use step-wise exploration in parameter space and theoretically derive the zeroth-order policy gradient. We further utilize the actor-critic architecture to effectively leverage the Markov property of SDPs and reduce the variance of gradient estimators. In each iteration, ZOAC employs samplers to collect trajectories with parameter space exploration, and alternates between first-order policy evaluation (PEV) and zeroth-order policy improvement (PIM). To evaluate the effectiveness of ZOAC, we apply it to a challenging multi-lane driving task, optimizing the parameters in a rule-based, non-differentiable driving policy that consists of three sub-modules: behavior selection, path planning, and trajectory tracking. We also compare it with gradient-based RL methods on three Gymnasium tasks, optimizing neural network policies with thousands of parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the strong capability of ZOAC in solving SDPs. ZOAC significantly outperforms EAs that treat the problem as static optimization and matches the performance of gradient-based RL methods even without first-order information, in terms of total average return across all tasks.</description>

Abstract: We provide a systematic investigation of using physics-informed neural networks to compute Lyapunov functions. We encode Lyapunov conditions as a partial differential equation (PDE) and use this for training neural network Lyapunov functions. We analyze the analytical properties of the solutions to the Lyapunov and Zubov PDEs. In particular, we show that employing the Zubov equation in training neural Lyapunov functions can lead to approximate regions of attraction close to the true domain of attraction. We also examine approximation errors and the convergence of neural approximations to the unique solution of Zubov's equation. We then provide sufficient conditions for the learned neural Lyapunov functions that can be readily verified by satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, enabling formal verification of both local stability analysis and region-of-attraction estimates in the large. Through a number of nonlinear examples, ranging from low to high dimensions, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can outperform traditional sums-of-squares (SOS) Lyapunov functions obtained using semidefinite programming (SDP).</description>

      <title>Improving the Performance of Echo State Networks Through State Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing, using nonlinear dynamical systems, offers a cost-effective alternative to neural networks for complex tasks involving processing of sequential data, time series modeling, and system identification. Echo state networks (ESNs), a type of reservoir computer, mirror neural networks but simplify training. They apply fixed, random linear transformations to the internal state, followed by nonlinear changes. This process, guided by input signals and linear regression, adapts the system to match target characteristics, reducing computational demands. A potential drawback of ESNs is that the fixed reservoir may not offer the complexity needed for specific problems. While directly altering (training) the internal ESN would reintroduce the computational burden, an indirect modification can be achieved by redirecting some output as input. This feedback can influence the internal reservoir state, yielding ESNs with enhanced complexity suitable for broader challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate that by feeding some component of the reservoir state back into the network through the input, we can drastically improve upon the performance of a given ESN. We rigorously prove that, for any given ESN, feedback will almost always improve the accuracy of the output. For a set of three tasks, each representing different problem classes, we find that with feedback the average error measures are reduced by $30\%-60\%$. Remarkably, feedback provides at least an equivalent performance boost to doubling the initial number of computational nodes, a computationally expensive and technologically challenging alternative. These results demonstrate the broad applicability and substantial usefulness of this feedback scheme.</description>

      <title>Learning to Control Unknown Strongly Monotone Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a game where the players' utility functions include a reward function and a linear term for each dimension, with coefficients that are controlled by the manager. We assume that the game is strongly monotone, so gradient play converges to a unique Nash equilibrium (NE). The NE is typically globally inefficient. The global performance at NE can be improved by imposing linear constraints on the NE. We therefore want the manager to pick the controlled coefficients that impose the desired constraint on the NE. However, this requires knowing the players' reward functions and action sets. Obtaining this game information is infeasible in a large-scale network and violates user privacy. To overcome this, we propose a simple algorithm that learns to shift the NE to meet the linear constraints by adjusting the controlled coefficients online. Our algorithm only requires the linear constraints violation as feedback and does not need to know the reward functions or the action sets. We prove that our algorithm converges with probability 1 to the set of NE that satisfy target linear constraints. We then prove an L2 convergence rate of near-$O(t^{-1/4})$.</description>

      <title>USV-AUV Collaboration Framework for Underwater Tasks under Extreme Sea Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are valuable for ocean exploration due to their flexibility and ability to carry communication and detection units. Nevertheless, AUVs alone often face challenges in harsh and extreme sea conditions. This study introduces a unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-AUV collaboration framework, which includes high-precision multi-AUV positioning using USV path planning via Fisher information matrix optimization and reinforcement learning for multi-AUV cooperative tasks. Applied to a multi-AUV underwater data collection task scenario, extensive simulations validate the framework's feasibility and superior performance, highlighting exceptional coordination and robustness under extreme sea conditions. To accelerate relevant research in this field, we have made the simulation code (demo version) available as open-source.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Stable Matches in Decentralized Markets with Unknown Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04669v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matching algorithms have demonstrated great success in several practical applications, but they often require centralized coordination and plentiful information. In many modern online marketplaces, agents must independently seek out and match with another using little to no information. For these kinds of settings, can we design decentralized, limited-information matching algorithms that preserve the desirable properties of standard centralized techniques? In this work, we constructively answer this question in the affirmative. We model a two-sided matching market as a game consisting of two disjoint sets of agents, referred to as proposers and acceptors, each of whom seeks to match with their most preferable partner on the opposite side of the market. However, each proposer has no knowledge of their own preferences, so they must learn their preferences while forming matches in the market. We present a simple online learning rule that guarantees a strong notion of probabilistic convergence to the welfare-maximizing equilibrium of the game, referred to as the proposer-optimal stable match. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first completely decoupled, communication-free algorithm that guarantees probabilistic convergence to an optimal stable match, irrespective of the structure of the matching market.</description>

      <title>QuadWBG: Generalizable Quadrupedal Whole-Body Grasping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legged robots with advanced manipulation capabilities have the potential to significantly improve household duties and urban maintenance. Despite considerable progress in developing robust locomotion and precise manipulation methods, seamlessly integrating these into cohesive whole-body control for real-world applications remains challenging. In this paper, we present a modular framework for robust and generalizable whole-body loco-manipulation controller based on a single arm-mounted camera. By using reinforcement learning (RL), we enable a robust low-level policy for command execution over 5 dimensions (5D) and a grasp-aware high-level policy guided by a novel metric, Generalized Oriented Reachability Map (GORM). The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art one-time grasping accuracy of 89% in the real world, including challenging tasks such as grasping transparent objects. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our system can effectively manage a large workspace, from floor level to above body height, and perform diverse whole-body loco-manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Federated Learning: A Scalable Approach for Decentralized Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across diverse clients without sharing raw data. However, traditional FL approaches often face limitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on synchronous client updates, which can result in significant delays and increased communication overhead, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. To address these challenges in this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) algorithm, which allows clients to update the global model independently and asynchronously. Our key contributions include a comprehensive convergence analysis of AFL in the presence of client delays and model staleness. By leveraging martingale difference sequence theory and variance bounds, we ensure robust convergence despite asynchronous updates. Assuming strongly convex local objective functions, we establish bounds on gradient variance under random client sampling and derive a recursion formula quantifying the impact of client delays on convergence.
  The proposed AFL algorithm addresses key limitations of traditional FL methods, such as inefficiency due to global synchronization and susceptibility to client drift. It enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency in real-world settings with heterogeneous client populations and dynamic network conditions. Our results underscore the potential of AFL to drive advancements in distributed learning systems, particularly for large-scale, privacy-preserving applications in resource-constrained environments.</description>
