      <title>Sensorium Arc: AI Agent System for Oceanic Data Exploration and Interactive Eco-Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensorium Arc (AI reflects on climate) is a real-time multimodal interactive AI agent system that personifies the ocean as a poetic speaker and guides users through immersive explorations of complex marine data. Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.</description>

      <title>MMVA: Multimodal Matching Based on Valence and Arousal across Images, Music, and Musical Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Multimodal Matching based on Valence and Arousal (MMVA), a tri-modal encoder framework designed to capture emotional content across images, music, and musical captions. To support this framework, we expand the Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet) dataset, creating IMEMNet-C which includes 24,756 images and 25,944 music clips with corresponding musical captions. We employ multimodal matching scores based on the continuous valence (emotional positivity) and arousal (emotional intensity) values. This continuous matching score allows for random sampling of image-music pairs during training by computing similarity scores from the valence-arousal values across different modalities. Consequently, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in valence-arousal prediction tasks. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates its efficacy in various zeroshot tasks, highlighting the potential of valence and arousal predictions in downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Discrete Speech Tokens: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.</description>

      <title>Co-Reinforcement Learning for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) via group relative policy optimization for unified multimodal large language models (ULMs), aimed at simultaneously reinforcing generation and understanding capabilities. Through systematic pilot studies, we uncover the significant potential of ULMs to enable the synergistic co-evolution of dual capabilities within a shared policy optimization framework. Building on this insight, we introduce CoRL, a co-reinforcement learning framework comprising a unified RL stage for joint optimization and a refined RL stage for task-specific enhancement. With the proposed CoRL, our resulting model, ULM-R1, achieves average improvements of 7% on three text-to-image generation datasets and 23% on nine multimodal understanding benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRL and highlight the substantial benefit of reinforcement learning in facilitating cross-task synergy and optimization for ULMs. Code is available at https://github.com/mm-vl/ULM-R1.</description>
