      <title>Polaronic correlations from optimized ancilla wave functions for the Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a family of ancilla qubit variational wave-functions [Zhang and Sachdev, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023172 (2020)] to describe the polaronic correlations in the pseudo-gap metal phase of a hole-doped 2D Fermi-Hubbard model. Comparison to ultra-cold atom quantum simulator data [Koepsel et al., Science 374, 82 (2021)] reveals both qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerical analysis from half-filling up to 80\% hole-doping, capturing the crossover from the polaronic regime to the Fermi liquid observed around $40\%$ doping.</description>

      <title>Strong pairing and symmetric pseudogap metal in double Kondo lattice model: from nickelate superconductor to tetralayer optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose and study a double Kondo lattice model which hosts robust superconductivity. The system consists of two identical Kondo lattice model, each with Kondo coupling $J_K$ within each layer, while the localized spin moments are coupled together via an inter-layer on-site antiferromagnetic spin coupling $J_\perp$. We consider the strong $J_\perp$ limit, wherein the local moments tend to form rung singlets and are thus gapped. However, the Kondo coupling $J_K$ transmits the inter-layer entanglement between the local moments to the itinerant electrons. Consequently, the itinerant electrons experience a strong inter-layer antiferromangetic spin coupling and form strong inter-layer pairing, which is confirmed through numerical simulation in one dimensional system. Experimentally, the $J_K \rightarrow -\infty$ limits of the model describes the recently found bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, while the $J_K&gt;0$ side can be realized in tetralayer optical lattice of cold atoms. Two extreme limits, $J_K \rightarrow -\infty$ and $J_K \rightarrow +\infty$ limit are shown to be simplified to a bilayer type II t-J model and a bilayer one-orbital t-J model, respectively. Thus, our double Kondo lattice model offers a unified framework for nickelate superconductor and tetralayer optical lattice quantum simulator upon changing the sign of $J_K$. We highlight both the qualitative similarity and the quantitative difference in the two sides of $J_K$. Finally, we discuss the possibility of a symmetric Kondo breakdown transition in the model with a symmetric pseudogap metal corresponding to the usual heavy Fermi liquid.</description>

      <title>Frustrated hopping from orbital decoration of a primitive two-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01512v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials hosting flat electronic bands are a central focus of condensed matter physics as promising venues for novel electronic ground states. Two-dimensional (2D) geometrically frustrated lattices such as the kagome, dice, and Lieb lattices are attractive targets in this direction, anticipated to realize perfectly flat bands. Synthesizing these special structures, however, poses a formidable challenge, exemplified by the absence of solid-state materials realizing the dice and Lieb lattices. An alternative route leverages atomic orbitals to create the characteristic electron hopping of geometrically frustrated lattices. This strategy promises to expand the list of candidate materials to simpler structures, but is yet to be demonstrated experimentally. Here, we report the realization of frustrated hopping in the van der Waals (vdW) intermetallic Pd$_5$AlI$_2$, emerging from orbital decoration of a primitive square lattice. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillations measurements, we demonstrate that the band structure of Pd$_5$AlI$_2$ includes linear Dirac-like bands intersected at their crossing point by a flat band, essential characteristics of frustrated hopping in the Lieb and dice lattices. Moreover, Pd$_5$AlI$_2$ is exceptionally stable, with the unusual bulk band structure and metallicity persisting in ambient conditions down to the monolayer limit. Our ability to realize an electronic structure characteristic of geometrically frustrated lattices establishes orbital decoration of primitive lattices as a new approach towards electronic structures that remain elusive to prevailing lattice-centric searches.</description>

      <title>Terahertz high-harmonic generation in gapped antiferromagnetic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of magnetization in antiferromagnets, resulting in high-frequency spin waves (high-order harmonics) as signal carriers, enable fast magnetic state switching in spintronic devices. More harmonic orders potentially allow more information to be conveyed by the spins. Developing theoretical models to describe these waves in antiferromagnets is essential for predicting their properties and guiding experimental efforts. Here, we consider the role of linear and quadratic spin-phonon couplings (SPCs) in achieving high-order harmonics in the THz magnetization of a gapped antiferromagnetic spin chain. A THz steady laser's electric field indirectly drives spins via phonons. Using spin-wave theory, mean-field theory, and the Lindblad formalism, we analyze the resulting nonlinear dynamics. We highlight the distinct mechanisms for harmonic generation when a phonon is coupled to the easy-plane and easy-axis of spins. Moreover, we observe that quadratic SPC blocks odd harmonics due to invariant inversion symmetry, while linear SPC generates both odd and even harmonics. We also investigate the effects of drive frequency, drive amplitude, phonon damping, and spin damping on the number of harmonics. Our findings offer an alternative pathway for developing nonlinear magnonics.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall effect in Mott insulators via skew-scattering by the scalar spin chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport is a crucial probe for studying excitations in insulators. In Mott insulators, the primary candidates for heat carriers are spins and phonons, and which dominates the thermal conductivity is a persistent issue. Typically, phonons dominate the longitudinal thermal conductivity while the thermal Hall effect (THE) is primarily associated with spins, which requires time-reversal symmetry breaking. The coupling between phonons and spins usually depends on spin-orbit interaction and is relatively weak. Here, we propose a new mechanism for this coupling and the associated THE: the skew scattering of phonons via spin fluctuations by the scalar spin chirality. This coupling does not require spin-orbit interaction and is ubiquitous in Mott insulators, leading to a thermal Hall angle on the order of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$. Based on this mechanism, we investigate the THE in YMnO$_3$ with a trimerized triangular lattice where the THE beyond spins was recognized, and predict the THE in the Kagome and square lattices.</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum disordered phase in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ under intermediate magnetic field along $c$ axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the exotic quantum spin liquid phase in Kitaev magnets has garnered great research interests and remains a significant challenge. In experiments, most of the proposed candidate materials exhibit an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at low temperatures, thus the challenge transforms into the searching for a field-driven disordered phase that is distinct from the partially polarized paramagnetic phase after suppressing the AFM order. Recently, Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has been proposed as one of the prime candidates, where the Kitaev interaction is realized by the high-spin $t^{5}_{2g}e^2_g$ configuration, and spin-orbit entangled $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ state in a bond-edge shared honeycomb lattice. In this study, we identify an emergent intermediate disordered phase induced by an external field along the $c$-axis of the honeycomb plane. This phase is characterized through magnetization and magnetocaloric effect experiments in high magnetic fields. To explain the experimental results, we propose an effective spin model with large AFM Kitaev interaction, which yields results in good agreement with both our findings and previously reported data. We determine that the effective $K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model for Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ is nearly dual to that of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under an unitary transformation. Given the insignificant fragility of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ sample, further high-field experiments can be conducted to explore this intermediate-field quantum spin disordered phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TeNPy (short for 'Tensor Network Python') is a python library for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum systems with tensor networks. The philosophy of this library is to achieve a balance of readability and usability for new-comers, while at the same time providing powerful algorithms for experts. The focus is on MPS algorithms for 1D and 2D lattices, such as DMRG ground state search, as well as dynamics using TEBD, TDVP, or MPO evolution. This article is a companion to the recent version 1.0 release of TeNPy and gives a brief overview of the package.</description>

      <title>Switchable anomalous Hall effect by selective mirror symmetry breaking in a kagome magnet GdMn6Ge6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02030v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystal symmetry plays a pivotal role in protecting the nontrivial electronic states in a topological phase. Manipulation of the crystal symmetry and hence the nontrivial topological states would serve as a fertile ground to explore exotic topological properties. Combining experimental and theoretical investigations, we demonstrate herein the flexible switch of nontrivial topological states in the single phase of kagome magnet GdMn6Ge6. The intrinsic anomalous Hall effect caused by distinct Berry curvatures along different crystallographic directions is realized through selectively breaking the mirror symmetries in these directions by external magnetic field, which is fully supported by the first-principles calculations. Our results set an explicit example demonstrating the strong correlation between structure symmetry and nontrivial topological states, as well as the switchable topological properties in a single magnetic topological phase.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin liquid in a generalized Kitaev honeycomb model with $\mathbb{Z}_4$ 1-form symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a large $N$ generalization of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a simple nearest-neighbor interacting Hamiltonian. In particular, we focus on the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ case with isotropic couplings, which is characterized by an exact $\mathbb{Z}_4$ one-form symmetry. Guided by symmetry considerations and an analytical study in the single chain limit, on the infinitely long cylinders, we find the model is gapped with an extremely short correlation length. Combined with the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ one-form symmetry, this suggests the model is topologically ordered. To pin down the nature of this phase, we further study the model on both finite and infinitely long strips, where we consistently find a $c=1$ conformal field theory (CFT) description, suggesting the existence of chiral edge modes described by a free boson CFT. Further evidence is found by studying the dimer correlators on infinitely long strips. We find the dimer correlation functions show a power-law decay with the exponent close to 2 on the boundary of the strip, while decay much faster in the bulk. Combined with the topological entanglement entropy extracted from cylinder geometry, we identify the spin liquid is chiral and supports a $\mathrm{U}(1)_{-8}$ chiral topological order. A unified perspective for all $\mathbb{Z}_N$ type Kitaev models is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Feature of Quantum Many-Body Scar States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical correlations of nonintegrable systems with quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states generated by a ladder operator. The spectral function of the ladder operator has an exact $\delta$-function peak induced by the QMBS states. As a concrete example, we show that in the one-dimensional (1D) spin-$1$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, the spectral function of two-magnon excitations exhibits a characteristic bow-tie shape composed of a $\delta$-function resonance peak at momentum $k=\pi$ and a continuum spectrum elsewhere. The two-magnon excitations can be observed with the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy on quasi-1D nickelates and other spin-$1$ antiferromagnetic materials, thus it paves the way to detecting the (approximate) QMBS states in realistic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom arising from doping a Mott insulating quantum spin liquid (QSL) has been a topic of research for several decades. Calculating properties of these fractionalized metallic states in single-band models are generally restricted to mean-field patron descriptions and small fluctuations around these states, which are insufficient for quantitative comparison of observables to measurements performed in strongly-correlated systems. In this work, we numerically study a class of correlated electronic wavefunctions which support fractionalized spin and charge excitations and which fully take into account gauge fluctuations through the enforcement of local Hilbert space constraints. By optimizing the energy of these wavefunctions against the hole-doped Fermi Hubbard Hamiltonian, we obtain a variational ansatz for describing the low-energy physics of this model. We compare measurements of hole-induced spin-spin correlation functions to measurements taken in low temperature cold-atom simulations of the Hubbard model and find quantitative agreement between the two. In particular, we demonstrate the emergence of magnetic polaron correlations in these metallic states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Order and Magneto-Elasticity in the Electronic Excitations of Gd-$i$-MAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the investigation of electronic collective modes in rare-earth-based magnets (Mo$_{2/3}$RE$_{1/3}$)$_2$AlC (also known as RE-$i$-MAX phases), where RE=Gd, Yb, and Dy, using single crystal samples. A detailed investigation of the Raman spectra of Gd-$i$-MAX samples at low temperatures, with a focus on the phonon behavior in relation to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase transition at 26 K is presented. Significant shifts in the central frequencies of several low-frequency phonon modes were observed below 25 K, correlating with the N\'{e}el transition. Integrated Raman intensity measurements indicated a reduction in the electronic background below the AFM transition temperature, suggesting the opening of a magnetic gap. Our analysis showed no new phonon modes. Therefore, we do not see any indication of a Brillouin zone folding of phonon mode to the $\Gamma$-point in our measurement. However, the hardening of all phonon modes at low temperatures points to a strong spin-phonon coupling effect. Using a temperature-dependent model of phonon frequency, we determined the spin-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ to be less than 0.1 cm$^{-1}$ for all frequencies, which is of the same order of magnitude as found in other antiferromagnetic materials such as MnF$_{2}$ and FeF$_{2}$ with $T_N=68~K$ and $T_N=78~K$, respectively, but significantly lower than that of $CuO$ with $T_N=213~K$.</description>

      <title>Exploring magnetic and topological complexity in MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$: from frustrated ground states to nontrivial Hall conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the intriguing topological itinerant magnet MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$, characterized by bilayer kagome Mn layers encasing a hexagonal Sn layer. Using \textit{ab initio} Density functional theory and Dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we uncover the complex electronic properties and many-body configuration of its magnetic ground state. Mn d-orbital electrons form a frustrated many-body ground state with significant quantum fluctuations, resulting in competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spin exchanges. Our band dispersion calculations reveal a mirror symmetry-protected nodal line in the \textit{k}$_z$ = 0 plane. When spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is introduced, the gap is formed along the nodal line lifted due to broken time-reversal symmetry with magnetic ordering, leading to substantial intrinsic Berry curvature. We identify Dirac fermions, van Hove singularities, and flat band near the Fermi energy (\textit{E}$_F$), with SOC introducing a finite gap at key points. The unique proximity of the flat band to \textit{E}$_F$ suggests potential instabilities. Spin-orbit coupling opens a 20 meV gap at the quadratic touching point between the Dirac and flat band, bestowing a nonzero Z$_2$ invariant. This leads to a significant spin Hall conductivity. Despite the presence of large incoherent scattering due to electronic interactions, band crossings and flat band features persist at finite temperatures. MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$ exhibits intriguing topological and magnetic properties, with promising applications in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric Effect of Topological Excitations in Kitaev Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional magnetic sub-Kelvin cooling relies on the nearly free local moments in hydrate paramagnetic salts, whose utility is hampered by the dilute magnetic ions and low thermal conductivity. Here we propose to use instead fractional excitations inherent to quantum spin liquids (QSLs) as an alternative, which are sensitive to external fields and can induce a very distinctive magnetocaloric effect. With state-of-the-art tensor-network approach, we compute low-temperature properties of Kitaev honeycomb model. For the ferromagnetic case, strong demagnetization cooling effect is observed due to the nearly free $Z_2$ vortices via spin fractionalization, described by a paramagnetic equation of state with a renormalized Curie constant. For the antiferromagnetic Kitaev case, we uncover an intermediate-field gapless QSL phase with very large spin entropy, possibly due to the emergence of spinon Fermi surface. Potential realization of topological excitation cooling in Kitaev materials is also discussed, which may offer a promising pathway to circumvent existing limitations in the paramagnetic hydrates.</description>

      <title>Lattice and magnetic structure in the van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the lattice and magnetic structure in van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3, characterized by a BiI3-type structure at room temperature. Neutron diffraction experiments were performed on both polycrystalline and single-crystalline VBr3 samples, revealing clear magnetic Bragg peaks emerging below the N\'eel temperature of TN = 26.5 K. These magnetic Bragg peaks can be indexed by k = (0, 0.5, 1) in hexagonal notation. Our refinement analysis suggests that the antiferromagnetic order in VBr3 manifests as a zigzag structure. Moreover, we observed peak splitting for nuclear Bragg peaks in the HK-plane below the structure transition temperature of Ts = 94 K, indicating the breaking of 3-fold symmetry within the ab-plane.</description>

      <title>Importance of electron-phonon coupling near the electron-liquid to Wigner-crystal transition in two-dimensional atomically thin materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of electron-phonon coupling on the location of the Fermi Liquid to Wigner Crystal transition in the two-dimensional electron gas realized in various material platforms. Based on dimensional estimates of the relevant parameters, we conclude that (as conventionally assumed) phonons are negligible in traditional semiconductor quantum well systems, but likely play a significant role in various recently synthesized atomically thin two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Gauge Symmetry in (2+1)d Topological Orders: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for understanding symmetries in topological phases in 2+1 dimensions using the string-net model, encompassing both gauge symmetries that preserve anyon species and global symmetries permuting anyon species, including both invertible symmetries describable by groups and noninvertible symmetries described by categories. As an archetypal example, we reveal the first noninvertible categorical gauge symmetry of topological orders in 2+1 dimensions: the Fibonacci gauge symmetry of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, described by the Fibonacci fusion 2-category. Our approach involves two steps: first, establishing duality between different string-net models with Morita equivalent input fusion categories that describe the same topological order; and second, constructing symmetry transformations within the same string-net model when the dual models have isomorphic input fusion categories, achieved by composing duality maps with isomorphisms of degrees of freedom between the dual models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We offer a streamlined and computationally powerful characterization of higher representations (higher charges) for defect operators under generalized symmetries, employing the powerful framework of Symmetry TFT $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. For a defect $\mathscr{D}$ of codimension p, these representations (charges) are in one-to-one correspondence with gapped boundary conditions for the SymTFT $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$ on a manifold $Y = \Sigma_{d-p+1} \times S^{p-1}$, and can be efficiently described through dimensional reduction. We explore numerous applications of our construction, including scenarios where an anomalous bulk theory can host a symmetric defect. This generalizes the connection between 't Hooft anomalies and the absence of symmetric boundary conditions to defects of any codimension. Finally we describe some properties of surface charges for (3 + 1)d duality symmetries, which should be relevant to the study of Gukov-Witten operators in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>First-principles investigation of the emergence of multiferroicity and skyrmions in CrI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrI2 shows promise for spintronic applications. Its electronic and magnetic properties are known to be strongly influenced by electronic correlations. In this work, we employ density functional theory calculations where electronic correlations in CrI2 are considered within an on-site Coulomb interaction, U, with U being determined using the perturbative approach based on the linear response method. We show that the accuracy of an on-site Coulomb interaction is essential for predicting the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic ground state of CrI2, which allows the existence of ferroelectricity and non-zero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) interaction. Our calculation shows that the ground state of bulk CrI2 has electric polarization of 0.15 {\mu}C/cm-2 pointing along the z-axis and the small DMI energy that changes sign with the ferroelectric polarization switching. The DMI and polarization are enhanced to 0.28 meV/formula-unit and 0.63 {\mu}C/cm-2 when Pt intercalates bilayers of CrI2, due to its large spin-orbit coupling strength and large off-center displacement. Such an enhanced DMI leads to the N\'eel skyrmions, whose handedness is controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Our work contributes to the creation and manipulation of bits in skyrmions-based memory devices.</description>

      <title>Strongly interacting Hofstadter states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) hosts a multitude of strongly correlated states at partial fillings of its flat bands. In a magnetic field, these flat bands further evolve into a unique Hofstadter spectrum renormalized by strong Coulomb interactions. Here, we study the interacting Hofstadter states spontaneously formed within the topological magnetic subbands of an ultraclean MATBG device, notably including symmetry-broken Chern insulator (SBCI) states and fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. The observed SBCI states form a cascade with their Chern numbers mimicking the main sequence correlated Chern insulators. The FQH states in MATBG form in Jain sequence; however, they disappear at high magnetic field, distinct from conventional FQH states which strengthen with increasing magnetic field. We reveal a unique magnetic field-driven phase transition from composite fermion phases to a dissipative Fermi liquid. Our theoretical analysis of the magnetic subbands hosting FQH states predicts non uniform quantum geometric properties far from the lowest Landau level. This points towards a more natural interpretation of these FQH states as in-field fractional Chern insulators of the magnetic subbands.</description>

      <title>Double-leaf Riemann surface topological converse magnetoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric field control of magnetism in solids, i.e. the converse magnetoelectricity, is highly desired for applications of scalable energy-efficient logic devices. However, it is not only a technical challenge but also a scientific paradox, since in principle the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom obey distinct rules of symmetries. Despite the great progresses obtained in the community of multiferroics during the past decades, the success of magnetoelectricity remains on its way and more alternative approaches with conceptual revolution are urgently needed. Here, by introducing the concept of topology into multiferroics, an exotic magnetoelectric double-leaf Riemann-surface is unveiled based on the mechanism of spin-dependent $d-p$ hybridization in a two-dimensional magnet: GdI$_2$ monolayer. Protected by the topology, a $180^\circ$ spin reversal can be precisely achieved by an electric cycle, leading to a robust and dissipationless converse magnetoelectric function. Such a topological magnetoelectricity allows the nontrivial manipulation of magnetization by AC electric field. In this category, more candidate materials with better performance are designed targetedly, which pave the road to the potential applications with topological magnetoelectrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). % This phase may be equally realized with two quantum Ising spin chains coupled through a spin interaction along $z$ direction. In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization crossover is sharper in quasiperiodic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the strong disorder may significantly slow down or even completely hinder the thermalization of quantum many-body systems. A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit thermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in the behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in random and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase in the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic systems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency towards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the existence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase transition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our understanding of many-body dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of the realization of a ferromagnetic Haldane state in a spin-2 bilinear-biquadratic spin system on an orthogonal-dimer chain. The coexistence of a ferromagnetic state and a Haldane state is due to the rigorous correspondence between the eigenstates of a spin-2 model and a spin-1/2 Heisenberg model; i.e., "eigensystem embedding." Numerical exact-diagonalization calculations indicate that the ground state in the model is a fractionally magnetized M = 3/4 Haldane state. Moreover, a ferromagnetic-dimer multiplet state is an exact ground state on a lattice, where the direct product of dimer singlet states is the ground state in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg model that includes one-, two-, and three-dimensional orthogonal-dimer lattices. Eigensystem embedding demonstrates that a quantum ferromagnet can be obtained for an arbitrary spin S &gt;= 2 in any dimension and for any lattice in which anomalous ground states are realized in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg model.</description>

Abstract: Parafermions are anyons with the potential for realizing non-local qubits that are resilient to local perturbations. Compared to Majorana zero modes, braiding of parafermions implements an extended set of topologically protected quantum gates. This, however, comes at the price that parafermionic zero modes can not be realized in the absence of strong interactions whose theoretical description is challenging. In the present work, we construct a simple lattice model for interacting spinful electrons with parafermionic zero energy modes. The explicit microscopic nature of the considered model highlights new realization avenues for these exotic excitations in recently fabricated quantum dot arrays. By density matrix renormalization group calculations, we identify a broad range of parameters, with well-localized zero modes, whose parafermionic nature is substantiated by their unique $8\pi$ periodic Josephson spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 pyrochlore compounds exhibit quantum fluctuations in a spin ice-like state. These compounds have not been adequately studied based on the concept of magnetic frustration. Here, we have synthesised and characterised Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 to investigate their ground-state magnetic properties. We confirmed the cubic pyrochlore structure via X-ray powder diffraction. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements show an absence of magnetic order down to 400 mK. Interestingly, the low-temperature magnetic heat capacity of Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 exhibits a broad maximum around T_{\text{max}} = 0.9 K and T_{\text{max}} = 1 K, respectively. The low-temperature Cmag data fit with the power-law C_{\text{mag}} \approx T^{\frac{d}{n}} with dependencies of T^{1.71} for Gd2GaSbO7 and T^{1.49} for Gd2InSbO7, suggesting spin fluctuations caused by the disorder of magnetic moments at low temperatures. Both compounds retain residual entropy akin to water ice, resembling the spin ice state. Additionally, we analysed the ratio between nearest-neighbour exchange and dipolar interaction for all reported Gd-based pyrochlores, finding that Gd2InSbO7 has the lowest and weakest exchange interaction among them. This indicates that chemical pressure affects exchange interaction due to the different pathways of mediators between magnetic ions. This study reveals robust quantum fluctuations in the ground state in GGSO and GISO, similar to quantum spin ice compounds such as Pr2Zr2O7, Pr2Sn2O7, and Yb2GaSbO7. Other Gd-pyrochlore compounds exhibit long-range magnetic order, which is in stark contrast to this.</description>

Abstract: Centrosymmetric GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ exhibits a variety of multi-Q magnetic states as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field, including a square skyrmion-lattice phase. The material's behavior is strongly dependent on the direction of the applied field, with different phase diagrams resulting for fields applied parallel or perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$ axis. Here, we present the results of muon-spin relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) measurements on single crystals of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. Our analysis is based on the computation of muon stopping sites and consideration of zero-point motion effects, allowing direct comparison with the underlying spin textures in the material. Using transverse-field $\mu^+$SR with fields applied along either the [001] or [100] crystallographic directions, we distinguish between the magnetic phases in this system via their distinct muon response, providing additional evidence for the skyrmion and meron-lattice phases, while also suggesting the existence of RKKY-driven muon hyperfine coupling. Zero-field $\mu^+$SR provides clear evidence for a transition between two distinct magnetically-ordered phases at 39 K.</description>

Abstract: Multipolar spin systems provide a rich ground for the emergence of unexpected states of matter due to their enlarged spin degree of freedom. In this study, with a specific emphasis on $S=1$ magnets, we explore the interplay between spin nematic states and spin liquids. Based on the foundations laid in the prior work [R. Pohle et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, L140403 (2023)], we investigate the $S=1$ Kitaev model with bilinear-biquadratic interactions, which stabilizes, next to Kitaev spin liquid, spin nematic and triple-$q$ phases, also an exotic chiral spin liquid. Through a systematic reduction of the spin degree of freedom -- from $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ to $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ and ultimately to a discrete eight-color model -- we provide an intuitive understanding of the nature and origin of this chiral spin liquid. We find that the chiral spin liquid is characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy, bound by a residual entropy, extremely short-ranged correlations, a nonzero scalar spin chirality marked by $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux order, and a gapped continuum of excitations. Our work contributes not only to the specific exploration of $S=1$ Kitaev magnets but also to the broader understanding of the importance of multipolar spin degree of freedom on the ground state and excitation properties in quantum magnets.</description>

Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids host quasiparticle excitations that carry a fraction of the electronic charge. Moreover, in contrast to bosons and fermions that carry exchange statistics of $0$ and $\pi$ respectively, these quasiparticles of FQH fluids, when braided around one another, can accumulate a Berry phase, which is a fractional multiple of $\pi$. Deploying the spherical geometry, we numerically demonstrate that composite fermion particle (CFP) excitations in the Jain FQH states carry Abelian fractional statistics. Previously, the exchange statistics of CFPs were studied in the disk geometry, where the statistics get obscured due to a shift in the phase arising from the addition of another CFP, making its determination cumbersome without prior knowledge of the shift. We show that on the sphere this technical issue can be circumvented and the statistics of CFPs can be obtained more transparently. The ideas we present can be extended to determine the statistics of quasiparticles arising in certain non-Abelian partonic FQH states.</description>

Abstract: In metals, low-energy effective theories are characterized by a set of coupling functions. Among them, the angle-dependent Fermi momentum specifies the size and shape of Fermi surface. Since the Fermi momentum grows incessantly under the renormalization group flow, a metallic fixed point is defined only modulo a rescaling of Fermi momentum. In this paper, we discuss the physical consequences of this projective nature of fixed points for non-Fermi liquids with hot Fermi surfaces. The first is the absence of a unique dynamical critical exponent that dictates the relative scaling between energy and momentum. The second is mismatches between the scaling dimensions of couplings and their relevancy. Nonetheless, each projective fixed point is characterized by a few marginal and relevant coupling functions, and the notion of universality survives. We illustrate our findings by charting the space of projective fixed points and extracting their universal properties for the Ising-nematic quantum critical metal beyond the patch theory. To control the theory, we use the dimensional regularization scheme that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface. Near the upper critical dimension, two exactly marginal coupling functions span the space of stable projective fixed points: functions that specify the shape of the Fermi surface and the angle-dependent Fermi velocity. All other coupling functions, including the Landau functions and the universal pairing interaction, are fixed by those two marginal functions. With decreasing dimensions, the forward scattering remains irrelevant while the pairing interaction becomes relevant near two dimensions. In two dimensions, it is expected that the universal superconducting fluctuations lower the symmetry of the non-Fermi liquid realized above the superconducting transition temperatures from the loop U(1) group to a proper subgroup.</description>

      <title>Tuning structural modulation and magnetic properties in metal-organic coordination polymers [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$(HCOO)$_3$</title>

Abstract: Three solid solutions of [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$(HCOO)$_3$, with $x$ = 0.25 (1), 0.50 (2) and 0.75 (3), were synthesized and their nuclear structures and magnetic properties were characterized using single crystal neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements. At room temperature, all three compounds crystallize in the Pnma orthorhombic space group, akin to the cobalt and nickel end series members. Upon cooling, each compound undergoes distinct series of structural transitions to modulated structures. Compound 1 exhibits a phase transition to a modulated structure analogous to the pure nickel compound, while compound 3 maintains the behaviour observed in the pure cobalt compound, although in both cases the temperatures at which the phase transitions occur differ slightly from the pure phases. Monochromatic neutron diffraction measurements showed that the structural evolution of 2 diverges from that of either parent compound, with the competing hydrogen bond interactions which drive the modulation throughout the series producing a unique sequence of phases. It involves two modulated phases below 96(3) K and 59(3) K, with different q vectors, similar to the pure cobalt compound (with modulated phases below 128 K and 96 K), however it maintains the modulated phase below magnetic order (at 22.5(7) K), resembling the pure nickel compound (which present magnetic order below 34 K), resulting in an improper modulated magnetic structure. Despite these large scale structural changes, magnetometry data reveal that the bulk magnetic properties of these solid solutions form a linear continuum between the end members. Notably, doping of the metal site in these solid solutions allows for tuning of bulk magnetic properties, including magnetic ordering temperature, transition temperatures, and the nature of nuclear phase transitions, through adjustment of metal ratios.</description>

      <title>Novel magnetic topological insulator FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ with controllable topological quantum phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we report a new intrinsic magnetic topological insulator FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ based on first-principles calculations and it can achieve a rich topological phase under pressure modulation. Without pressure, we predict that both FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders are non-trivial topological insulators. Furthermore, FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ of FM-z order will undergo a series of phase transitions from topological insulator to semimetals and then to trivial insulator under pressure. Finally, we further clarify and verify topological phase transitions with low-energy effective model calculations. This topological phase transition process is attributed to the synergy of the magnetic moment and the spin-orbit coupling. The unique topological properties of FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ will be of great interest in driving the development of quantum effects.</description>

      <title>More Quantum Chemistry with Fewer Qubits</title>

Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the total runtime has highly favourable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. Numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory. As such, we demonstrate that perturbation theory can help to reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Description of two-dimensional altermagnetism: Categorization using spin group theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, recently spotlighted in condensed matter physics, presents captivating physical properties and holds promise for spintronics applications. This study delves into the theoretical description and categorization of two-dimensional altermagnetism using spin group theory. Employing spin-group formalism, we establish seven distinct spin layer groups, extending beyond the conventional five spin Laue groups, to describe two-dimensional altermagnetism. Utilizing these findings, we classify previously reported two-dimensional altermagnets and identify novel materials exhibiting altermagnetism. Specifically, monolayer MnTeMoO$_6$ and VP$_2$H$_8$(NO$_4$)$_2$ are predicted to be two-dimensional altermagnets. Furthermore, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristics through symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations, substantiating their altermagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Coherence Length of Electronic Nematicity in Iron-Based Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in laser-excited photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM) advance the visualization of electronic nematicity and nematic domain structures in iron-based superconductors. In FeSe and BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.87}$P$_{0.13}$)$_2$ superconductors, it has been reported that the thickness of the electronic nematic domain walls is unexpectedly long, leading to the formation of mesoscopic nematicity wave [T. Shimojima $\textit{et al.}$, Science $\textbf{373}$ (2021) 1122]. This finding demonstrates that the nematic coherence length $\xi_{\rm nem}$ can be decoupled from the lattice domain wall. Here, we report that the electronic domain wall thickness shows a distinct variation in related materials: it is similarly long in FeSe$_{0.9}$S$_{0.1}$ whereas it is much shorter in undoped BaFe$_2$As$_2$. We find a correlation between the thick domain walls and the non-Fermi liquid properties of normal-state resistivity above the nematic transition temperature. This suggests that the nematic coherence length can be enhanced by underlying spin-orbital fluctuations responsible for the anomalous transport properties.</description>

      <title>Scalable tomography of many-body quantum environments with low temporal entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a complex many-body environment is a ubiquitous problem in quantum science. General non-Markovian environments are characterized by their influence matrix~(IM) -- a multi-time tensor arising from repeated interactions between the system and environment. While complexity of the most generic IM grows exponentially with the evolution time, recent works argued that for many instances of physical many-body environments, the IM is significantly less complex. This is thanks to area-law scaling of temporal entanglement, which quantifies the correlations between the past and the future states of the system. However, efficient classical algorithms for computing IM are only available for non-interacting environments or certain interacting 1D environments. Here, we study a learning algorithm for reconstructing IMs of large many-body environments simulated on a quantum processor. This hybrid algorithm involves experimentally collecting quantum measurement results of auxiliary qubits which are repeatedly coupled to the many-body environment, followed by a classical machine-learning construction of a matrix-product (MPS) representation of the IM. Using the example of 1D spin-chain environments, with a classically generated training dataset, we demonstrate that the algorithm allows scalable reconstruction of IMs for long evolution times. The reconstructed IM can be used to efficiently model quantum transport through an impurity, including cases with multiple leads and time-dependent controls. These results indicate the feasibility of characterizing long-time dynamics of complex environments using a limited number of measurements, under the assumption of a moderate temporal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

      <title>Fading ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) represents a breakthrough in many-body physics since it allows to link thermalization of physical observables with the applicability of random matrix theory (RMT). Recent years were also extremely fruitful in exploring possible counterexamples to thermalization, ranging, among others, from integrability, single-particle chaos, many-body localization, many-body scars, to Hilbert-space fragmentation. In all these cases the conventional ETH is violated. However, it remains elusive how the conventional ETH breaks down when one approaches the boundaries of ergodicity, and whether the range of validity of the conventional ETH coincides with the validity of RMT-like spectral statistics. Here we bridge this gap and we introduce a scenario of the ETH breakdown in many-body quantum systems, dubbed fading ergodicity regime, which establishes a link between the conventional ETH and non-ergodic behavior. We conjecture this scenario to be relevant for the description of finite many-body systems at the boundaries of ergodicity, and we provide numerical and analytical arguments for its validity in the quantum sun model of ergodicity breaking phase transition. For the latter, we provide evidence that the breakdown of the conventional ETH is not associated with the breakdown of the RMT-like spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Multiscalar Critical Models with Localised Cubic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interface localised interactions are studied for multiscalar universality classes accessible with the perturbative $\varepsilon$ expansion in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The associated beta functions at one loop and partially at two loops are derived, and a wide variety of interface conformal field theories (CFTs) is found, even in cases where the bulk universality class is free or as simple as the Wilson-Fisher description of the $O(N)$ model. For up to three scalar fields in the bulk, interface fixed points are classified for all bulk universality classes encountered in this case. Numerical results are obtained for interface CFTs that exist for larger numbers of multiscalar fields. Our analytic and numerical results indicate the existence of a vast space of interface CFTs, much larger than the space of defect CFTs found for line and surface defect deformations of multiscalar models in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. In this vast space, stable interfaces found for free and $O(N)$ bulks belong to the $F_4$ family, with global symmetries $SO(3), SU(3), Sp(6)$ and $F_4$, realised with $N=5,8,16,24$ scalar fields, respectively.</description>

      <title>Displacive Jahn--Teller transition in NaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Below its Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{JT}$, NaNiO$_2$ has a monoclinic layered structure consisting of alternating layers of edge-sharing NaO$_6$ and Jahn-Teller-distorted NiO$_6$ octahedra. Above $T_\mathrm{JT}$ where NaNiO$_2$ is rhombohedral, diffraction measurements show the absence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion, accompanied by an increase in the unit cell volume. Using neutron total scattering, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments as local probes of the structure we find direct evidence for a displacive, as opposed to order-disorder Jahn-Teller transition at $T_\mathrm{JT}$. This is supported by \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. To our knowledge this study is the first to show a displacive Jahn-Teller transition in any material using direct observations with local probe techniques.</description>
