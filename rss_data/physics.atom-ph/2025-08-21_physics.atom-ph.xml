      <title>A unified perspective of high-harmonic generation in gases and solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum optical generalization of the quantum-matter Lewenstein model of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in gases that contains two channels corresponding to the inter- and intraband HHG in solids. Both channels can be presented as a semiclassical current multiplied by the vacuum field strength, resulting in a quantitative correction and a faster roll-off of the harmonic power with order than in previous theories. In gases, like in solids, intraband HHG dominates at low orders; the switchover harmonic corresponds to a specific photon energy, independent of pump wavelength.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of five-times ionized krypton: Kr VI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes the spectral analysis of five-times ionized krypton ion (Kr VI) using a high-resolution spectrogram recorded on a 3 m normal incidence vacuum spectrograph in the wavelength 230--2075~\AA~region. For spectral excitation, a gas-puff triggered spark source was used. This work thoroughly examined all previously reported spectroscopic analyses for Kr VI. Many missing and new levels were added to the list of known energy levels with the help of several supportive transitions. The present experimental findings were theoretically supported within the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) formalism implemented in the Cowan suite of codes. A total of 52 (including eight new) energy levels were established with the help of 169 unique observed spectral lines (31 are new) assigned to 175 (6 doubly assigned) transitions. All observed and Ritz wavelengths were reported with their uncertainties, modeled intensities, and other evaluated radiative transition parameters such as transition probabilities and cancellation factors.</description>

      <title>Production of ultracold asymmetric tops from Sr atoms and SrOH molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the comprehensive theoretical investigation of the Sr-SrOH system identifying it as a promising route to production of ultracold asymmetric top molecules. Combining high-level ab initio electronic structure calculations with rigorous quantum scattering simulations, we determine strongly anisotropic, non-reactive interaction potential and an exceptionally dense spectrum of near-threshold resonances. Presented excited states, transition dipole moments, and results of the one-dimensional STIRAP model suggest the possibility of coherently transferring weakly bound complexes to the rovibrational ground state.</description>

      <title>Bright 25-attosecond light pulses reach the one atomic unit of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating ever-shorter and brighter light pulses has long been a central pursuit in ultrafast science, as it benchmarks our ability to create and manipulate the coherence on the intrinsic timescale of sub-atomic electron motion. The current state-of-the-art in attosecond pulse generation reaches durations of 40-50 attoseconds (1 as = $10^{-18}$ seconds), produced via high-order harmonic generation (HHG) driven by secondary mid-infrared light sources. However, these sources often suffer from low stability and poor HHG conversion efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of 25$\pm$2 attosecond light pulses, a new world record for the shortest light pulse, driven by a post-compressed, industrial-grade Yb-based laser system. The resulting high-harmonic spectrum spans photon energies from 50 eV to 320 eV, covering the carbon K-edge, with a calibrated photon flux exceeding $10^{12}$ photons per second, approximately three orders of magnitude higher than previous studies. The pulse duration was characterized using an angle-resolved photoelectron streaking camera on helium atoms and systematically optimized through the use of dielectric filters of varying thicknesses to compensate the attochirp. Our study reaches the threshold of one atomic unit of time (24.2 attoseconds), the boundary between atomic and ionic physics, opening the door to resolving exciting ionic quantum dynamics with tabletop lasers.</description>

      <title>Strong Confinement of a Nanoparticle in a Needle Paul Trap: Towards Matter-Wave Interferometry with Nanodiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the nanodiamond together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work, we achieve strong confinement of a levitated particle, which is crucial for angular confinement, precise positioning, and perhaps also advantageous for deep cooling. We designed a needle Paul trap with a controllable distance between the electrodes, giving rise to a strong electric gradient. By combining it with an effective charging method - electrospray - we reach a trap frequency of up to 40 kHz, which is more than twice the state of the art. We believe that the designed trap could become a significant tool in the hands of the community working towards massive matter-wave interferometry. We would be happy to make more details available upon request.</description>

      <title>Polaronic Effect in High-Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with electron-phonon coupling modeled via the Holstein interaction. The system dynamics are simulated using the tight-binding approximation, with local phonons approximated as quantum harmonic oscillators. Phononic degrees of freedom significantly expand the Hilbert space dimension. This interaction modifies the eigenenergy spectrum by introducing new states within previously existing gaps, enhancing the harmonic yield through additional allowed transitions.</description>

A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work we detail the trapping of a nanodiamond at 10^-8 mbar, which is good enough for the realization of a short-duration Stern-Gerlach interferometer. We describe in detail the cooling we have performed to sub-Kelvin temperatures, and demonstrate that the nanodiamond remains confined within the trap even under high-intensity 1560 nm laser illumination. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</description>

In this work, we review current methods for loading nanodiamonds into a Paul trap, and their capabilities and limitations regarding our application. We also present our experiments on loading and launching nanodiamonds using a vibrating piezoelectric element and by electrical forces. Finally, we present our design of a novel nanodiamond loading method for ultra-high-vacuum experiments. As the production of highly accurate, high-purity nanodiamonds with a single NV required for interferometric measurements is expected to be expensive, we put emphasis on achieving high loading efficiency, while loading the charged ND into a Paul trap in ultra-high vacuum.</description>

      <title>Realization of a fast triple-magic all-optical qutrit in strontium-88</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical clock states of alkaline earth and alkaline earth-like atoms are the fundament of state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks. An important prerequisite for the operation of optical clocks are magic trapping conditions, where electronic and motional dynamics decouple. Here, we identify and experimentally demonstrate simultaneous magic trapping for two clock transitions in strontium-88, realizing so-called triple-magic conditions at a specially chosen magic angle. Under these conditions, we operate an all-optical qutrit comprising the ground state $^1S_0$, and the two metastable clock states $^3P_0$ and $^3P_2$. We demonstrate fast optical control in an atom array using two- and three-photon couplings to realize high-fidelity manipulation between all qutrit states. At the magic angle, we probe the coherence achievable in magic-angle-tuned traps and find atom-atom coherence times between the metastable states as long as 715(30) ms. Our work opens several new directions, including qutrit-based quantum metrology on optical transitions and high-fidelity and high-coherence manipulation on the strontium-88 fine-structure qubit.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement of Cs($nF_J$) quantum defects and calculations of scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_J$ ,$nD_J$ , and $nF_J$ series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our recent work on cesium S and D states [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 233005 (2024)] to the F states. We present absolute frequency measurements of the $|6S_{1/2}, F = 3\rangle \rightarrow nF_{5/2,7/2}(n = 28-68)$ Rydberg series to measure the spectrum of $^{133}$Cs. Atomic spectra are obtained using a three-photon excitation scheme referenced to an optical frequency comb in a sample of ultracold $^{133}$Cs. By globally fitting the absolute-frequency measurements to the modified Ritz formula, we determine the quantum defects of the $nF_{5/2}$ and $nF_{7/2}$ series. The ionization potential extracted for both series from the modified Ritz formula agrees with our measurements based on the S and D series. Fine-structure intervals are calculated and parameterized. The wave functions computed for the energies from the quantum defects are used to calculate transition dipole moments. We compare the reduced electric-dipole matrix elements with available benchmarks and find agreement within the precision of those works. The scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_J$ , $nD_J$ and $nF_J$ series are calculated based on the now more accurate set of wave functions. Moreover, we report the polarizability as a series in powers of the effective principal quantum number and find the main coefficients of the expansion. The results will be useful for calculating properties of $^{133}$Cs such as collision and decay rates, polarizabilities, and magic wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Probing the spatial distribution of k-vectors in situ with Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for mapping in situ the spatial distribution of photon momentum across a laser beam using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as a moving probe. By displacing the BEC, we measure the photon recoil by atom interferometry at different positions in the laser beam and thus reconstruct a two-dimensional map of the local intensity and effective dispersion of the $k$ wave vector. Applied to a beam diffracted by a diaphragm, this method reveals a local extra recoil effect, which exceeds the magnitude $h\nu/c$ of the individual plane-waves over which the beam can be decomposed. This method offers a new way to precisely characterize wavefront distortions and to evaluate one of the major systematic bias sources in quantum sensors based on atom interferometry.</description>
