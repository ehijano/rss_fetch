      <title>Scaling Properties of ${\phi}$-Meson and Light Charged Hadron Production in Small and Large Systems at PHENIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results on the identified charged-hadron ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, $p$, $\bar{p}$) production at midrapidity region ($|\eta|&lt;$ 0.35) have been measured by the PHENIX experiment in ${\rm {\it p}+Al}$, ${\rm ^{3}He+Au}$, ${\rm Cu+Au}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN} }}$ = 200 GeV and ${\rm U+U}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN} }}$ = 193 GeV. These measurements are presented through the invariant transverse-momentum ($p_T$) and transverse-mass ($m_T$) spectra for different collision centralities. The averaged freeze-out temperature value for different systems was found to be $166.1 \pm 2.2$ MeV, and do not exhibit any dependence on the collision centrality and $\langle N_{\rm part} \rangle$ values. The particle ratios of $K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$ have been measured in different centrality ranges of large and small collision systems. The values of $K/\pi$ ratios measured in all considered collision systems were found to be consistent with those measured in $p$$+$$p$ collisions. Furthermore, the identified charged-hadron nuclear-modification factors ($R_{AB}$) are also presented. Enhancement of proton $R_{AB}$ values over meson $R_{AB}$ values was observed in central ${\rm ^{3}He+Au}$, ${\rm Cu+Au}$, and ${\rm U+U}$ collisions. The proton $R_{AB}$ values measured in ${\rm {\it p}+Al}$ collision system were found to be consistent with $R_{AB}$ values of $\phi$, $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, and $\pi^0$ mesons, suggesting that the size of the system produced in ${\rm {\it p}+Al}$ collisions is too small for recombination to cause a noticeable increase in proton production.</description>

      <title>Measurement of two-neutrino double electron capture half-life of $^{124}$Xe with PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed studies of two-neutrino double electron capture (2$\nu$DEC) is a crucial step towards searching for the neutrino-less mode to explore the Majorana nature of neutrinos. We have measured precisely the half-life of the 2$\nu$DEC process in $^{124}$Xe, utilizing a total exposure of 1.73 tonne$\cdot$year from the commissioning run and the first science run of the PandaX-4T experiment. A time-dependent background model in the $\mathcal{O}$(10 keV) energy is constructed for the first time in PandaX-4T data. With an unbinned maximum likelihood fit, we determine the half-life of the 2$\nu$DEC process to be $(1.03\pm0.15_{\rm stat}\pm0.06_{\rm sys})\times 10^{22}$$\,$yr. Furthermore, we have evaluated the branching ratio for both electrons captured from the $K$ shell ($KK$) to be $(65\pm5)\%$, which aligns with the $^{124}$Xe nuclear model calculations within 1.5$\,$$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Probing small neutron skin variations in isotope pairs by hyperon-antihyperon production in antiproton--nucleus interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to measure the evolution of the neutron skin thickness between different isotopes with small statistical and systematic uncertainties. We consider antiproton--nucleus interactions close to the production threshold of $\Lambda \overline{\Lambda }$ and $\Sigma^-\overline{\Lambda }$ pairs. At low energies, $\Lambda \overline{\Lambda }$ pairs are produced in $\overline{\text{p}} +\text{p}$ collisions, while $\Sigma^-\overline{\Lambda }$ pairs can only be produced in $\overline{\text{p}} +\text{n}$ interactions. Within a simple geometrical picture we show that the double ratio for the production of $\Sigma^-\overline{\Lambda }$ and $\Lambda \overline{\Lambda }$ pairs for two different isotopes are directly related to the variation of the neutron skin thickness between the two nuclei. Performing high statistics calculations with the Gie\ss en Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) transport model for several isotope pairs covering a wide range of elements we verify a strong correlation between the double ratio from the full transport simulations and the schematic model. This correlation enables us to quantify the high potential of the proposed method for precise studies of neutron skin variations in isotope chains.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin effects and light-quark dipole moments at lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to probe light-quark dipole interactions at lepton colliders using the azimuthal asymmetry of a collinear dihadron pair $(h_1h_2)$ produced in association with another hadron $h'$. This asymmetry, arising from quantum interference in the quark spin space, is exclusively sensitive to dipole interactions at the leading power of the new physics scale and simultaneously probes both the real and imaginary components of the dipole couplings. By combining all possible channels of $h'$, this method allows for disentangling the up and down quark dipole moments and has the potential to significantly strengthen current constraints by one to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Proton-neutron pair correlations in neutron-rich nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Background] Nuclear pairing is a well-established many-body correlation, particularly among like particles in a spin-singlet state. However, the strength of spin-triplet proton-neutron (pn) pairing in nuclei has remained a long-standing and unresolved issue. [Purpose] The relative strength of spin-triplet pn pairing compared to spin-singlet one is investigated by introducing and analyzing the polarizability of the response to pn pair transfers. [Method] The nuclear energy-density functional method is employed. The ground state of the target nucleus is described using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation, which accounts for the conventional superfluidity of like-particle pairs. The response to pn pair transfers is then analyzed using the pn quasiparticle random-phase approximation. [Results] The spin-singlet pn-pair correlation is strongest at $N=Z$ and decreases monotonically with the increasing number of excess neutrons, whereas the spin-triplet pn-pair correlation is shown to depend non-monotonically on the neutron number and can be enhanced in cases where the pn-pair transfers involving the $\pi j_&gt; \otimes \nu j_&lt;$ configuration occur at low energy. [Conclusions] The shell effect, which uniquely appears in spin-triplet pn-pair correlation, serves as a key indicator of the strength of pn-pair correlations.</description>

      <title>Direct-photon production in inelastic and high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the first measurement of direct photons at the transverse momentum of $ 1 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 6$ GeV/$c$ at midrapidity $|\eta| &lt; 0.8$ in inelastic and high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The fraction of virtual direct photons in the inclusive virtual photon spectrum is obtained from a fit to the dielectron invariant mass spectrum. In the limit of zero invariant mass, this fraction is equal to the relative contribution of real direct photons in the inclusive real photon spectrum. Contributions from decays of light-flavour neutral mesons are estimated using independent measurements in proton-proton collisions at the same energy and the same event class. The yield of direct photons in inelastic pp collisions is compared to perturbative QCD calculations. The integrated photon yield is studied as a function of charged-particle multiplicity and is compared to the results from other experiments and theoretical calculations. The results show a significant increase of direct-photon yield with charged-particle multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Precise Mass Measurement of the Longest Odd-Odd Chain of \boldmath $1^+$ Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise mass measurements of the odd-odd $^{108, 110, 112, 114, 116}$Rh ground and isomeric states were performed using the Canadian Penning Trap at Argonne National Laboratory, showing a good agreement with recent JYFLTRAP measurements. A new possible isomeric state of $^{114}$Rh was also observed. These isotopes are part of the longest odd-odd chain of identical ground state spin-parity assignment, of 1$^+$, spanning $^{104-118}$Rh, despite being in a region of deformation. Realistic phenomenological mean-field calculations using ``universal'' Wood-Saxon Hamiltonian were performed, explaining this phenomenon for the first time. In addition, multi-quasiparticle blocking calculations were conducted to study the configuration of low-lying states in the odd-odd Rh nuclei and elucidate the observed anomalous isomeric yield ratio of $^{114}$Rh.</description>

      <title>Simulating collectivity in dense baryon matter with multiple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on construction of a modern multi-fluid approach to heavy-ion collisions at FAIR/BES energies (MUFFIN) and show the reproduction of basic experimental observables in Au-Au collisions in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program. We also show the $p_T$-differential and $p_T$-integrated polarization of (anti-)$\Lambda$ hyperons. In MUFFIN simulations, we observe a strong splitting between polarizations of $\Lambda$ and anti-$\Lambda$. The splitting is driven purely by a finite baryon chemical potential.</description>
