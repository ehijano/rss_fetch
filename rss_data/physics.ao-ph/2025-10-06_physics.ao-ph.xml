      <title>The Equilibrium Response of Atmospheric Machine-Learning Models to Uniform Sea Surface Temperature Warming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models for the global atmosphere that are capable of producing stable, multi-year simulations of Earth's climate have recently been developed. However, the ability of these ML models to generalize beyond the training distribution remains an open question. In this study, we evaluate the climate response of several state-of-the-art ML models (ACE2-ERA5, NeuralGCM, and cBottle) to a uniform sea surface temperature warming, a widely used benchmark for evaluating climate change. We assess each ML model's performance relative to a physics-based general circulation model (GFDL's AM4) across key diagnostics, including surface air temperature, precipitation, temperature and wind profiles, and top-of-the-atmosphere radiation. While the ML models reproduce key aspects of the physical model response, particularly the response of precipitation, some exhibit notable departures from robust physical responses, including radiative responses and land region warming. Our results highlight the promise and current limitations of ML models for climate change applications and suggest that further improvements are needed for robust out-of-sample generalization.</description>

      <title>Global impacts of organic aerosol acidity on sulfate and cloud formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic aerosols (OA) comprise a major fraction of atmospheric particulate matter and frequently contain acidic species, yet their contribution to overall aerosol acidity has not been explicitly considered in global climate models. We implement concentration-dependent OA acid dissociation, including recently demonstrated surface-specific effects, into the ECHAM-HAMMOZ global climate model and assess the impacts on aqueous aerosol sulfate chemistry and aerosol--cloud--climate interactions. We show that enhanced aerosol acidity from OA acid dissociation drives increased sulfate formation from aqueous-phase oxidation of $\mathrm{SO_2}$. The microphysics of additional secondary sulfate aerosol changes global cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC), with enhancements up to $13.9\%$. Increased cloud formation leads to a significant global mean cooling effect with a shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCRF) up to $-0.97~\mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$. We also find that surface-specific acid dissociation effects can further modify both aerosol chemistry and resulting aerosol--cloud--climate responses, in some cases with even stronger impact than bulk acidity conditions. Our results demonstrate significant effects of considering OA acidity, as well as surface-specific phenomena, in global climate models.</description>

      <title>Multi-faceted light pollution modelling and its application to the decline of artificial illuminance in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) has been increasing steadily over the past century, particularly during the last decade. This leads to rising light pollution, which is known to have adverse effects on living organisms, including humans. We present a new software package to model light pollution from ground radiance measurements. The software is called Otus 3 and incorporates innovative ALAN diffusion models with different atmospheric profiles, cloud covers and urban emission functions. To date, light pollution modelling typically focused on calculating the zenith luminance of the skyglow produced by city lights. In Otus 3 we extend this and additionally model the horizontal illuminance on the ground, including the contributions from skyglow and the direct illumination. We applied Otus 3 to France using ground radiance data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We calibrated our models using precise sky brightness measurements we obtained over 6 years at 139 different locations and make this dataset publicly available. We produced the first artificial illuminance map for France for the periods of 2013-2018 and 2019-2024. We found that the artificial ground illuminance in the middle of the night decreased by 23 % between these two periods, in stark contrast to the global trend.</description>

      <title>Technical overview and architecture of the FastNet Machine Learning weather prediction model, version 1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present FastNet version 1.0, a data-driven medium range numerical weather prediction (NWP) model based on a Graph Neural Network architecture, developed jointly between the Alan Turing Institute and the Met Office. FastNet uses an encode-process-decode structure to produce deterministic global weather predictions out to 10 days. The architecture is independent of spatial resolution and we have trained models at 1$^{\circ}$ and 0.25$^{\circ}$ resolution, with a six hour time step. FastNet uses a multi-level mesh in the processor, which is able to capture both short-range and long-range patterns in the spatial structure of the atmosphere. The model is pre-trained on ECMWF's ERA5 reanalysis data and then fine-tuned on additional autoregressive rollout steps, which improves accuracy over longer time horizons. We evaluate the model performance at 1.5$^{\circ}$ resolution using 2022 as a hold-out year and compare with the Met Office Global Model, finding that FastNet surpasses the skill of the current Met Office Global Model NWP system using a variety of evaluation metrics on a number of atmospheric variables. Our results show that both our 1$^{\circ}$ and 0.25$^{\circ}$ FastNet models outperform the current Global Model and produce results with predictive skill approaching those of other data-driven models trained on 0.25$^{\circ}$ ERA5.</description>
