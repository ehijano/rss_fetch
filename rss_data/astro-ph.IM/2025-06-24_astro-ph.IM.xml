      <title>Identifying Anomalous DESI Galaxy Spectra with a Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tens of millions of spectra being captured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provide tremendous discovery potential. In this work we show how Machine Learning, in particular Variational Autoencoders (VAE), can detect anomalies in a sample of approximately 200,000 DESI spectra comprising galaxies, quasars and stars. We demonstrate that the VAE can compress the dimensionality of a spectrum by a factor of 100, while still retaining enough information to accurately reconstruct spectral features. We then detect anomalous spectra as those with high reconstruction error and those which are isolated in the VAE latent representation. The anomalies identified fall into two categories: spectra with artefacts and spectra with unique physical features. Awareness of the former can help to improve the DESI spectroscopic pipeline; whilst the latter can lead to the identification of new and unusual objects. To further curate the list of outliers, we use the Astronomaly package which employs Active Learning to provide personalised outlier recommendations for visual inspection. In this work we also explore the VAE latent space, finding that different object classes and subclasses are separated despite being unlabelled. We demonstrate the interpretability of this latent space by identifying tracks within it that correspond to various spectral characteristics. For example, we find tracks that correspond to increasing star formation and increase in broad emission lines along the Balmer series. In upcoming work we hope to apply the methods presented here to search for both systematics and astrophysically interesting objects in much larger datasets of DESI spectra.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of a mission to Sedna -- Nuclear propulsion and advanced solar sailing concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the outer reaches of the Solar System presents significant propulsion and mission design challenges. This study assesses the feasibility of a mission to Sedna using two advanced propulsion concepts: the Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) rocket engine, based on D-$^{3}$He thermonuclear fusion, and a solar sail utilizing thermal desorption of its coating for propulsion. Both are evaluated for a one-way Earth-to-Sedna mission; however, due to the different performances the DFD would enable orbit insertion, whereas for the solar sail a flyby is envisioned. The analysis evaluates key mission parameters, including delivered payload capacity, travel time, and potential science return. For the DFD, we assume a 1.6 MW system with constant thrust and specific impulse, while for the solar sail, we consider acceleration via thermal desorption and a gravity-assist maneuver around Jupiter. The mission analysis incorporates four key phases: departure, interplanetary acceleration, interplanetary coasting, and rendezvous. Sedna is expected to pass through the perihelion of its orbit in 2075--2076 and then move again away from the Sun. Considering the distances involved, a mission targeting the object would need to be launched "relatively" soon, especially if using conventional propulsion systems, which could require up to 30 years of deep-space travel. In our study, results indicate that the DFD could reach Sedna in approximately 10 years, with 1.5 years of thrusting, while the solar sail, assisted by Jupiter's gravity, could complete the journey in 7 years. The feasibility of science payload accommodation, power availability, and communication constraints is also considered. These findings provide a comparative foundation for future deep-space mission planning.</description>

      <title>TasVisAn and InsPy -- Python Packages for Triple-Axis Spectrometer Data Visualization, Analysis, Instrument Resolution Calculation, and Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.</description>

      <title>HAWC Performance Enhanced by Machine Learning in Gamma-Hadron Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving gamma-hadron separation is one of the most effective ways to enhance the performance of ground-based gamma-ray observatories. With over a decade of continuous operation, the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory has contributed significantly to high-energy astrophysics. To further leverage its rich dataset, we introduce a machine learning approach for gamma-hadron separation. A Multilayer Perceptron shows the best performance, surpassing traditional and other Machine Learning based methods. This approach shows a notable improvement in the detector's sensitivity, supported by results from both simulated and real HAWC data. In particular, it achieves a 19\% increase in significance for the Crab Nebula, commonly used as a benchmark. These improvements highlight the potential of machine learning to significantly enhance the performance of HAWC and provide a valuable reference for ground-based observatories, such as Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and the upcoming Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO).</description>

      <title>Systematic Biases from ARM-Based Sensitivity and Imaging in Compton Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular resolution measure (ARM) is widely used in Compton camera analyses to characterize angular uncertainty and to define event selection criteria. However, the ARM distribution is fundamentally different from the point spread function (PSF), which represents the true spatial imaging response of the system on the celestial sphere. In this study, motivated by applications in gamma-ray astrophysics, we investigated the consequences of using ARM-based definitions in sensitivity estimation and image reconstruction. Through Monte Carlo simulations of 662 keV gamma-rays, we demonstrated that the background rejection power of ARM-based region-of-interest selections with the ARM resolution of 7.0$^{\circ}$ is equivalent to that of a PSF resolution of 33$^{\circ}$. As a result, treating the ARM resolution as a surrogate for the PSF resolution leads to significant overestimation of the signal-to-noise ratio, particularly in analyses assuming isotropic backgrounds. We further show that image reconstructions at pixel scales finer than the PSF resolution introduce substantial statistical uncertainties, reducing the effective number of independent spatial degrees of freedom. These findings underscore the necessity of PSF-based analysis for accurate sensitivity evaluation and statistically robust imaging in Compton cameras, particularly in applications where the background discrimination is critical.</description>

      <title>Algorithm to extract direction in 2D discrete distributions and a continuous Frobenius norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel algorithm for determining directionality in 2D distributions of discrete data. We compare a reference dataset with a known direction to a measured dataset with an unknown direction by the Frobenius norm of the difference (FND) to find the unknown direction. To generalize this concept, we develop a continuous Frobenius norm of the difference (CFND) as a continuous analog of the FND and derive its analytical expression. By relating fitted and normalized 2D Gaussian distributions, we show that the CFND approximates the FND, and we validate this relationship with computer simulations. We find that a first-order approximation of the CFND between two similar Gaussian distributions takes the form of an absolute sine function, offering a simple analytical form with potential for specialized applications in segmented inverse beta decay (IBD) neutrino detectors, astronomy, machine learning, and more. Although this method may easily extend to 3D scalar fields, our focus here is on 2D real-valued fields as it directly applies to directionality. Our methodology consists of modeling a 2D Gaussian distribution, binning the data into a histogram, and encoding it as a square matrix. Rotating this matrix around its geometric center and comparing it to a measured dataset using the FND gives us rotational data that we fit with an absolute sine function. The location of the minimum of this fit is the angle closest to the true angle of the direction in the measured dataset. We present the derivation and discuss initial applications of the CFND in our novel algorithm, demonstrating its success in approximating directionality in 2D distributions.</description>

      <title>An array of bulk-acoustic-wave sensors as a high-frequency antenna for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their simplest form, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) devices consist of a piezoelectric crystal between two electrodes that transduce the material's vibrations into electrical signals. They are adopted in frequency control and metrology, with well-established standards at frequencies of 5~MHz and above. Their use as a resonant-mass strain antenna for high-frequency gravitational waves has been recently proposed (Goryachev and Tobar, 2014). The estimated power spectral density sensitivity at the resonant frequencies is of the order of $10^{-21}\, \textrm{strain}/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$. In this paper, after introducing the science opportunity and potential of gravitational wave detection with BAWs, we describe the two-stage BAUSCIA project plan to build a multimode antenna based on commercial BAWs, followed by an optimized array of custom BAWs. We show that commercially available BAWs already provide sensitivity comparable to current experiments around 10~MHz. Finally, we outline options for optimization of custom devices to improve sensitivity in an unexplored region, probe multiple frequencies between 0.1 and 10 MHz, and target specific signals, such as post-merger emission from neutron stars or emission from various dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Advanced Modeling for Exoplanet Detection and Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research into light curves from stars (temporal variation of brightness) has completely changed how exoplanets are discovered or characterised. This study including star light curves from the Kepler dataset as a way to discover exoplanets (planetary transits) and derive some estimate of their physical characteristics by the light curve and machine learning methods. The dataset consists of measured flux (recordings) for many individual stars and we will examine the light curve of each star and look for periodic dips in brightness due to an astronomical body making a transit. We will apply variables derived from an established method for deriving measurements from light curve data to derive key parameters related to the planet we observed during the transit, such as distance to the host star, orbital period, radius. The orbital period will typically be measured based on the time between transit of the subsequent timelines and the radius will be measured based on the depth of transit. The density of the star and planet can also be estimated from the transit event, as well as very limited information on the albedo (reflectivity) and atmosphere of the planet based on transmission spectroscopy and/or the analysis of phase curve for levels of flux. In addition to these methods, we will employ some machine learning classification of the stars (i.e. likely have an exoplanet or likely do not have an exoplanet) based on flux change. This could help fulfil both the process of looking for exoplanets more efficient as well as providing important parameters for the planet. This will provide a much quicker means of searching the vast astronomical datasets for the likelihood of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Statistical Analysis of Exoplanet Habitability: Detection Bias and Earth Analog Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive multivariate statistical analysis of 517 exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to identify potentially habitable worlds and quantify detection bias in current surveys. Using eight key parameters (planetary radius, equilibrium temperature, insolation flux, density, and stellar effective temperature, radius, mass, metallicity), we developed a classification framework that successfully identifies Earth as an "Excellent Candidate" for habitability. Our analysis reveals that only 0.6% (3 planets including Earth) meet all habitability criteria under relaxed thresholds, while 75.0% exhibit "Good Star, Poor Planet" characteristics, indicating significant observational bias toward unsuitable planetary systems. Hotelling's T2 test demonstrates that potentially habitable planets are statistically significantly different from the general exoplanet population (p = 0.015). Mahalanobis distance analysis places Earth in the 69.4th percentile for statistical unusualness, confirming that Earth-like planets are genuine outliers in parameter space. We identify Kepler-22 b as a compelling Earth analog with remarkable parameter similarity, and reveal that 1.2% of planets represent "edge cases" orbiting M-dwarf stars with suitable planetary but marginal stellar conditions. These findings demonstrate systematic detection bias in exoplanet surveys and provide quantitative evidence for the rarity of Earth-like worlds while identifying high-priority targets for atmospheric characterization with JWST.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Detection with the IceTop Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IceTop is the cosmic-ray detector located on the surface of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, consisting of 81 pairs of ice-Cherenkov tanks. The rise in the energy threshold of air-shower measurements in IceTop due to accumulating snow emphasized the need for the next generation of IceCube surface detectors. For this purpose, the Surface Array Enhancement (SAE) is set to comprise elevated scintillator panels and radio antennas controlled by hybrid DAQ systems. The detectors of the SAE are also expected to extend to the planned IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array. An initial study with a prototype station is already conducted. We briefly review the SAE and the deployment as well as the calibration status of the upcoming stations of the planned array of 32 stations. The focus of this contribution is on the radio detection of extensive air showers. A preliminary estimation of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$), that is sensitive to the primary mass, with data from the 3 antennas of the prototype station was carried out. An extension of the method from previous analyses is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Validate the bright Gaia celestial reference frame with new VLBI astrometry of radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist inconsistencies between the bright and faint Gaia Celestial Reference Frame 3 (Gaia-CRF3), which manifests as a systematic rotation and needs to be independently estimated then corrected in future data releases. We collected 64 radio stars with VLBI astrometry, of which 16 have new VLBI observations with reference epochs close to Gaia. We estimated the orientation and spin biases of the bright Gaia-CRF3 by comparing VLBI radio star astrometry with their Gaia DR3 counterparts. We also attempted to estimate orientation by utilizing the a priori magnitude-dependent spin parameters derived from Gaia internal estimation. Our independent estimation of the orientation at G&lt;10.5 is [-15\pm119, +330\pm139,+218\pm109] uas (J2016.0), and the spin ([+21\pm18, +52\pm20,-7\pm20] uas/yr) agrees with Gaia internal estimation within 1-sigma range. The orientation-only estimation suggests that the orientation bias of the bright Gaia-CRF3 may also be magnitude-dependent.</description>

      <title>A complete census of planet-hosting binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the effect binarity can have on planet-formation is of crucial importance, as almost half of field stars reside in multiple systems. One effective way to assess this effect is to get an accurate picture of the population of planet-hosting binaries and compare its characteristics to that of field star binaries. We construct an extensive database, collected from intensive literature exploration, to achieve a complete census of all planet-hosting binaries known to date. Despite the heterogeneous character of the different surveys this database is built on, and the biases and selection effects that unavoidably affect any sample of planet-hosting binaries, we look for statistically significant trends and correlations within our sample. Our database provides the characteristics for 759 systems (among which 31 circumbinaries), which is an increase by a factor of 9 with respect to the previous complete census of planet-hosting binaries. Of the 728 S-type systems, 651 are binaries, 73 are triples and 4 are quadruples. The raw distribution of planet-hosting binary separations peaks around 500\,au instead of 50\,au for field binaries. By analyzing the distribution of on-sky angular separations as a function of distance $d_b$ to the systems we argue that the observed deficit of planet-hosting close-in binaries cannot be explained solely by observational biases. Likewise, by exploring how multiplicity fractions among planet-hosts vary with $d_b$ we suggest that the subsample of known planet-hosting binaries at $&lt;500\,$pc is not bias-dominated (but not bias-free). In this $&lt;500\,$pc domain, the multiplicity fraction of planet-hosting stars is $\sim22.5\%$, approximately half of the value for field stars, and the deficit of planet-hosting binaries extends to separations of $\sim500\,$au, giving an approximate estimate of the detrimental effect binarity has on planet-formation</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for feature selection and classification of Fast Radio Bursts</title>

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, exhibiting a wide range of physical and observational properties. Distinguishing between repeating and non-repeating FRBs remains a key challenge in understanding their nature. In this work, we apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs based on both primary observables from the CHIME catalog and physically motivated derived features. We evaluate three hybrid pipelines combining dimensionality reduction with clustering: PCA + k-means, t-SNE + HDBSCAN, and t-SNE + Spectral Clustering. To identify optimal hyperparameters, we implement a comprehensive grid search using a custom scoring function that prioritizes recall while penalizing excessive cluster fragmentation and noise. Feature relevance is assessed using principal component loadings, mutual information with the known repeater label, and permutation-based F\textsubscript{2} score sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the derived features including redshift, luminosity, and spectral properties, such as the spectral index and the spectral running, significantly enhance the classification performance. Finally, we identify a set of FRBs currently labeled as non-repeaters that consistently cluster with known repeaters across all methods, highlighting promising candidates for future follow-up observations and reinforcing the utility of unsupervised approaches in FRB population studies.</description>

      <title>Analytical transit light curves for power-law limb darkening: a comprehensive framework via fractional calculus and differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete analytical framework for computing exoplanetary transit light curves with arbitrary power-law limb darkening profiles $I(\mu) \propto \mu^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ can be any real number greater than $-1/2$, including the physically important non-integer cases. While the groundbreaking work of Agol et al. (2020) provided exact analytical solutions for polynomial limb darkening through recursion relations, stellar atmosphere models often favor power-law forms with fractional exponents (particularly $\alpha = 1/2$) that remained analytically intractable until now. We solve this fundamental limitation through two complementary mathematical approaches: (1) Riemann-Liouville fractional calculus operators that naturally handle non-integer powers through exact integral representations, and (2) a continuous differential equation framework that generalizes discrete polynomial recursions to arbitrary real exponents. Our method provides exact analytical expressions for all half-integer powers ($\alpha = k/2$) essential for 4-term limb darkening law by Claret (2000), maintains machine precision even at geometric contact points where numerical methods fail, and preserves the computational speed advantages crucial for parameter fitting. We demonstrate that the square-root limb darkening ($\alpha = 1/2$) favored by recent stellar atmosphere studies can now be computed analytically with the same efficiency as traditional quadratic models, achieving 10--100$\times$ speed improvements over numerical integration while providing exact analytical derivatives.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Optics with dLux II: Optical Design Maximising Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of astronomical hardware operating at the diffraction limit requires optimisation of physical optical simulations of the instrument with respect to desired figures of merit, such as photometric or astrometric precision. System design entails many parameters some of which may entangle the fidelity of science observables with strongly nonlinear dependencies upon instrument properties. Here we present a differentiable optical simulation framework dLux, a software library designed to construct optical models that are integrated with automatic differentiation. This approach enables the direct evaluation of gradients and higher-order derivatives through the forward model, facilitating statistically principled design and optimisation of instrument configurations. The methodology leverages numerically stable second- and higher-order derivatives to directly compute Fisher information and covariance forecasts, enabling efficient Bayesian experimental design targeted toward optimising abstracted figures of merit, such as the precision of parameters recovered through complex sets of operations. The method is validated against analytical results and applied to optimise the astrometric precision achievable with a parametrised telescope model and a diffractive pupil design relevant to exoplanet detection missions. To support reproducibility and facilitate methodological extension, we provide example implementations via open-source code on the Github sharing platform.</description>

      <title>False Alarm Rate based Statistical Detection Limit for Astronomical Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultra-fast astronomical observations featuring fast transients on sub-$\mu$s time scales, the conventional Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) threshold, often fixed at $5\sigma$, becomes inadequate as observational window timescales shorten, leading to unsustainably high False Alarm Rates (FAR). We provide a basic statistical framework that captures the essential noise generation processes relevant to the analysis of time series data from photon-counting detectors. In particular, we establish a protocol of defining detection limits in astronomical photon-counting experiments, such that a FAR-based criterion is preferred over the traditional SNR-based threshold scheme. We developed statistical models that account for noise sources such as dark counts, sky background, and crosstalk, and establish a probabilistic detection criterion applicable to high-speed detectors. The model is testified against the on-site data obtained in the Single-Photon Imager for Nanosecond Astrophysics (SPINA) experiment and consistency is confirmed. We compare the performance of several detector technologies, including photon-counting CMOS/CCDs, SPADs, SiPMs, and PMTs, in detecting faint astronomical signals. These findings offer insights into optimizing detector choice for future ultra-fast astronomical instruments and suggest pathways for improving detection fidelity under rapid observational conditions.</description>

      <title>A generalised non-linear reconstructor for all Fourier-type wavefront sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art adaptive optics (AO) systems perform non-linear Fourier-type wavefront sensing for real-time corrections of dynamic wavefront aberrations. This general class of sensors uses a filtering mask in the focal plane that converts phase fluctuations of the incoming light into intensity variations in the subsequent pupil plane. Due to their high sensitivity, Fourier-type wavefront sensors (WFSs) are the sensors of choice for many current and upcoming AO systems in ophthalmic imaging, free-space optical communications (FSOC) and astronomical ground-based telescopes such as the forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes (ELTs). Conventionally, linear methods, like a matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM), are used for the inversion of Fourier-type WFSs. However, their non-linear behavior gives rise to severe performance degradations when significant channel perturbations are observed. They are expected to occur during strong atmospheric turbulence conditions, which are commonplace for non-rural sites and daytime observations.
  This study presents a novel type of iterative reconstructor to overcome non-linear wavefront sensing regimes. The underlying method is the non-linear Landweber iteration with Nesterov acceleration, well known in the field of inverse problems. A significant advantage of the new approach is its direct applicability to any Fourier-type WFS. This is implemented by adapting the filtering mask of the specific Fourier-type WFSs in the model-based algorithm.
  Several Fourier-type wavefront sensors are considered for ELT-scale instruments and their performance with the new algorithm is compared. The study goes on to concentrate on the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS), one of the most well-known Fourier-type WFSs. We demonstrate in end-to-end simulations that this novel approach outperforms linear methods in non-linear sensing regimes.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between light curves of ellipsoidal variables with massive dark companions, contact binaries, and semidetached binaries using principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photometric methods for identifying dark companion binaries - binary systems hosting quiescent black holes and neutron stars - operate by detecting ellipsoidal variations caused by tidal interactions. The limitation of this approach is that contact and semidetached binaries can produce similarly looking light curves. In this work, we address the degeneracy of ellipsoidal light curves by studying the differences between synthetically generated light curves of dark companion, semidetached, and contact binary systems. We inject the light curves with various levels of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise to simulate the effects of instrumental noise and stellar spots. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition, we construct low-dimensional representations of the light curves. We find that the first two to five PCA components are sufficient to explain $99\%$ of variance in the data. The PCA representations are generally more informative than the Fourier representation for the same number of coefficients as measured by both the silhouette scores of the representations and the macro recalls of random forest classifiers trained on the representations. The random forest classifiers reach macro recalls from $0.97$ to $0.70$, indicating that the classes remain largely separable even under adverse conditions. We find that instrumental noise significantly impacts the class separation only when its standard deviation exceeds $10^{-3}$ mag, whereas the presence of spots can markedly reduce the class separation even when they contribute as little as $1\%$ of the light curve amplitude. We discuss the application of our method to real ellipsoidal samples, and we show that we can increase the purity of a sample of dark companion candidates by a factor of up to $27$ if we assume a prior purity of $1\%$, significantly improving the cost-efficiency of follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Commensal Transient Searches with MeerKAT in Gamma-Ray Burst and Supernova Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity and field of view of the MeerKAT radio telescope provides excellent opportunities for commensal transient searches. We carry out a commensal transient search in supernova and short gamma-ray burst fields using methodologies established in~\citet{commensal1}. We search for transients in MeerKAT L-band images with 30 minute integration times, finding 13 variable sources. We compare these sources to the VLASS and RACS survey data, and examine possible explanations for the variability. Additionally, for one of these sources we examine archival \textit{Chandra} ACIS data. We find that 12 of these sources are consistent with variability due to interstellar scintillation. The remaining source could possibly have some intrinsic variability. We also split the MeerKAT L-band into an upper and lower half, and search for transients in images with an 8 second integration time. We find a source with a duration of 8 to 16 seconds that is highly polarized at the lowest frequencies. This source is spatially coincident with a star detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}). We conclude that this source may be consistent with a stellar flare. Finally, we calculate accurate upper and lower limits on the transient rate using transient simulations.</description>

      <title>Residual test to search for microlensing signatures in strongly lensed gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a gravitational wave signal encounters a massive object, such as a galaxy or galaxy cluster, it undergoes strong gravitational lensing, producing multiple copies of the original signal. These strongly lensed signals exhibit identical waveform morphology in the frequency domain, allowing analysis without the need for complex lens models. However, stellar fields and dark matter substructures within the galactic lens introduce microlensing effects that alter individual signal morphologies. Identifying these microlensing signatures is computationally challenging within Bayesian frameworks. In this study, we propose a residual test to efficiently search for microlensing signatures by leveraging the fact that current Bayesian inference pipelines are optimized solely for the strong lensing hypothesis. Using cross-correlation techniques, we investigate the microlensing-induced deviations from the strong hypothesis, which are imprinted in the residuals. Most simulated signals from our realistic microlensing populations exhibit small mismatches between the microlensed and unlensed waveforms, but a fraction show significant deviations. We find that 28% (52%) and 34% (66%)of microlensed events with mismatch &gt; 0.03 and &gt; 0.1, respectively, can be discerned with O4 (O5) detector sensitivities, which demonstrates that high-mismatch events are more likely to be identified as microlensed. Including all events from a realistic population, 11% (21.5%) are identifiable with O4 (O5) sensitivity using our approach.</description>

      <title>Survey-Wide Asteroid Discovery with a High-Performance Computing Enabled Non-Linear Digital Tracking Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern astronomical surveys detect asteroids by linking together their appearances across multiple images taken over time. This approach faces limitations in detecting faint asteroids and handling the computational complexity of trajectory linking. We present a novel method that adapts ``digital tracking" - traditionally used for short-term linear asteroid motion across images - to work with large-scale synoptic surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin/LSST). Our approach combines hundreds of sparse observations of individual asteroids across their non-linear orbital paths to enhance detection sensitivity by several magnitudes. To address the computational challenges of processing massive data sets and dense orbital phase spaces, we developed a specialized high-performance computing architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments that take advantage of the extensive computational resources at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This work enables the detection of significantly fainter asteroids in existing and future survey data, potentially increasing the observable asteroid population by orders of magnitude across different orbital families, from near-Earth objects (NEOs) to Kuiper belt objects (KBOs).</description>
