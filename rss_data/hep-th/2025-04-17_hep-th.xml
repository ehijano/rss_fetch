      <title>Geometry of soft scalars at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the soft theorems for scattering amplitudes of scalar effective field theories to one-loop order. Our analysis requires carefully accounting for the fact that the soft limit is not guaranteed to commute with evaluating IR-divergent loop integrals; new results for the soft limit of general scalar one-loop integrals are presented. The geometric soft theorem remains unmodified for any derivatively-coupled scalar effective field theory, and we conjecture that this statement holds to all orders. In contrast, the soft theorem receives nontrivial corrections in the presence of potential interactions, analogous to the case of non-Abelian gauge theories. We derive the universal leading-order correction to the scalar soft theorem arising from potential interactions at one loop. Explicit examples are provided that illustrate the general results.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-\textbf{$c$} CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <title>Scale separation on AdS$_3\times S^3$ with and without supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional chiral gauged Einstein-Maxwell supergravity admits a two-parameter rotating dyonic string solution whose near horizon limit is the direct product of AdS$_3$ and a squashed three-sphere $S^3$. For a particular relation between the two parameters, the solution preserves $1/2$ supersymmetry. We determine the complete Kaluza-Klein spectrum of the theory around these AdS$_3$ backgrounds. For the supersymmetric backgrounds, the states organize into infinite towers of long and short multiplets of OSp(2|2). In a certain limit of parameters, both the supersymmetric and the non-supersymmetric spectra exhibit scale separation. In the latter case there are five topologically massive vectors and five scalars retaining finite masses with integer conformal dimensions, and in the supersymmetric case there are supersymmetric partners with half integer conformal dimensions, while all other masses diverge.</description>

      <title>A Two-Phase Perspective on Deep Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that learning in deep neural networks proceeds in two phases: a rapid curve fitting phase followed by a slower compression or coarse graining phase. This view is supported by the shared temporal structure of three phenomena: grokking, double descent and the information bottleneck, all of which exhibit a delayed onset of generalization well after training error reaches zero. We empirically show that the associated timescales align in two rather different settings. Mutual information between hidden layers and input data emerges as a natural progress measure, complementing circuit-based metrics such as local complexity and the linear mapping number. We argue that the second phase is not actively optimized by standard training algorithms and may be unnecessarily prolonged. Drawing on an analogy with the renormalization group, we suggest that this compression phase reflects a principled form of forgetting, critical for generalization.</description>

      <title>Magnetized black holes in Kaluza-Klein theory and the Kerr/CFT correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the Kerr/CFT correspondence for magnetized black holes arising from Kaluza--Klein theory, demonstrating that Kerr/CFT holography persists beyond the traditional Einstein--Maxwell framework. Notably, unlike in the Einstein--Maxwell case, the massless neutral scalar field equation here is fully separable into radial and angular parts. This separability reveals a hidden conformal symmetry in the near--horizon, low--frequency regime, providing further support for the robustness of Kerr/CFT dualities in extended gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Quadratic gravity with propagating torsion and asymptotic freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of metric-affine gravitational theories with action quadratic in curvature and torsion tensors. Using the heat kernel technique, we compute the torsion contributions to the one-loop counterterms in the ultraviolet limit. It is found that vectorial and axial components of torsion preserve the qualitative picture of the renormalization group flow of the metric sector. However, there exists a specific nonminimal kinetic term for the pure tensorial (hook-antisymmetric traceless) component of torsion that renders the gravitational couplings asymptotically free in the absence of tachyons.</description>

      <title>Perturbed symmetric-product orbifold: first-order mixing and puzzles for integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the marginal deformation of the symmetric-product orbifold theory Sym$_N(T^4)$ which corresponds to introducing a small amount of Ramond-Ramond flux into the dual $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ background. Already at first order in perturbation theory, the dimension of certain single-cycle operators is corrected, indicating that wrapping corrections from integrability must come into play earlier than expected. We also discuss a flaw in the original derivation of the integrable structure of the perturbed orbifold. Together, these observations suggest that more needs to be done to correctly identify and exploit the integrable structure of the perturbed orbifold CFT.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Poisson and Poisson-supersymmetric sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit and construct new examples of supersymmetric 2D topological sigma models whose target space is a Poisson supermanifold. Inspired by the AKSZ construction of topological field theories, we follow a graded-geometric approach and identify two commuting homological vector fields compatible with the graded symplectic structure, which control the gauge symmetries and the supersymmetries of the sigma models. Exemplifying the general structure, we show that two distinguished cases exist, one being the differential Poisson sigma model constructed before by Arias, Boulanger, Sundell and Torres-Gomez and the other a contravariant differential Poisson sigma model. The new model features nonlinear supersymmetry transformations that are generated by the Poisson structure on the body of the target supermanifold, giving rise to a Poisson supersymmetry. Further examples are characterised by supersymmetry transformations controlled by the anchor map of a Lie algebroid, when this map is invertible, in which case we determine the geometric conditions for invariance under supersymmetry and closure of the supersymmetry algebra. Moreover, we show that the common thread through this type of models is that their supersymmetry-generating vector field is the coadjoint representation up to homotopy of a Lie algebroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we derive a closed-form analytic expression for the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between a squeezed state and the vacuum state in a free relativistic massive scalar Quantum Field Theory within wedge regions of Minkowski spacetime. Similarly to the case of coherent states, this relative entropy is proportional to the smeared Pauli-Jordan distribution. Consequently, the Araki-Uhlmann entropy between a squeezed state and the vacuum satisfies all expected properties: it remains positive, increases with the size of the Minkowski region under consideration, and decreases as the mass parameter grows.</description>

      <title>Holographic phase transitions via thermally-assisted tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the thermal bounce solution in holographic models that describes first-order phase transitions between the deconfined and confined phases in strongly-coupled gauge theories. This new, periodic Euclidean solution represents transitions that occur via thermally-assisted tunneling and interpolates between the $O(4)$-symmetric vacuum bubble at zero temperature and the high temperature $O(3)$-symmetric critical bubble associated with classical thermal fluctuations. The exact thermal bounce solution can be used to obtain the bounce action at low temperatures which allows for a more accurate determination of vacuum decay rates, significantly improving previous estimates in holographic models. In particular, provided the phase transition is sufficiently supercooled, new predictions are obtained for the gravitational wave signal strength for critical temperatures ranging from the TeV scale up to $10^{12}$ GeV, some of which are within reach of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the beta function in the functorial formulation of two-dimensional quantum field theories (FQFT). A key feature of this approach is the absence of ultraviolet divergences. We show that, nevertheless, in the FQFT perturbation theory, the local observables of deformed theories acquire logarithmic dimension, leading to a conformal anomaly. The beta function arises in the functorial approach as an infinitesimal transformation of the partition function under the variation of the metric's conformal factor, without ultraviolet divergences, UV cutoff, or the traditional renormalization procedure.</description>

      <title>Circular orbits and accretion disk around a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and electrically charged particles in the vicinity of a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To examine the motion of an electrically charged test particle, we propose an expression for electromagnetic 4-potential that contains the impacts of loop quantum gravity. This electromagnetic 4-potential satisfies approximately the covariant Maxwell's equations to first order in the loop quantum effects. We explore the effects of the loop quantum correction parameter on the particle geodesics. We investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for both neutral and electrically charged particles in detail, demonstrating that the loop quantum parameter significantly influences on the ISCO radius, causing it to shrink. Finally, we explore the accretion disk around the loop quantum black hole. We delve into the electromagnetic radiation flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and the spectral luminosity as radiation properties of the accretion disk in detail. We show that the loop quantum correction parameter shifts the profile of the electromagnetic flux and accretion disk temperature towards the central object, leading to a slight increase in these quantities.</description>

      <title>The Sky as a Killing Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more simplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental perspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper, we propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and generalizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by considering BMS-like symmetries for "asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons", or A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector field satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The construction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of the Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with different dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the results by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing horizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a larger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of "superdilations". We speculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work, including the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general relativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in terms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter spacetime and Killing horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are the extended lecture notes for a minicourse presented at the I S\~ao Paulo School on Gravitational Physics discussing the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group, the group of symmetries at null infinity on asymptotically flat spacetimes. The BMS group has found many applications in classical gravity, quantum field theory in flat and curved spacetimes, and quantum gravity. These notes build the BMS group from its most basic prerequisites (such as group theory, symmetries in differential geometry, and asymptotic flatness) up to modern developments. These include its connections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem, the memory effect, its use to construct Hadamard states in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, and other ideas. Advanced sections briefly discuss the main concepts behind the infrared triangle in electrodynamics, superrotations, and the Dappiaggi--Moretti--Pinamonti group in expanding universes with cosmological horizons (or "asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes"). New contributions by the author concerning asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons are discussed at the end.</description>

      <title>Hodge Dual Gauge Symmetry in Minimal Einstein-Aether Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether gravity is a theory that breaks the local Lorentz symmetry by introducing a preferred direction via a vector field, which is considered to play the role of an aether. The theory is identified by four coupling constants between the aether and gravity. Minimal Einstein-aether is the special case in which only one of the couplings is non-zero. We show that the aether vector field in its minimal version is Hodge dual to a gauge field. The gauge symmetry in the dual description has been known for decades and has been used to implement a cosmological constant into the Lagrangian. As a result, solutions to the well-established gauge theory can be transferred into the minimal Einstein-aether theory straightforwardly. On the other hand, some of the proposed solutions to the minimal Einstein-aether theory could be discarded as pure gauges of the vanishing aether. We prove as a theorem that this holds true for all divergence-less aether fields.</description>

      <title>Can spacetime fluctuations generate entanglement between co-moving accelerated detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies [Class. Quant. Grav. 42, 03LT01 (2025); Phys. Rev. D 111, 045023 (2025)] indicate that in a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum of former Rindler frame appears to be thermally populated for an observer in shifted Rindler frame. Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift parameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift parameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a set-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find that if their Rindler frames (consequently their trajectories) get infinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this entanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift parameter, provided it is non-vanishing. We investigate the dependence of entanglement on acceleration of the detectors. The present study indicates that the entanglement between two detectors, moving on the same Rindler wedge, is possible. Moreover, small spacetime fluctuations can lead to entanglement between detectors, moving along same classical trajectory. Hence we feel that such theoretical prediction has potential to probe the Planck length nature of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Coupling a vertex algebra to a large center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose a Lie group $G$ acts on a vertex algebra $V$. In this article we construct a vertex algebra $\tilde{V}$, which is an extension of $V$ by a big central vertex subalgebra identified with the algebra of functionals on the space of regular $\mathfrak{g}$-connections $(d+A)$.
  The category of representations of $\tilde{V}$ fibres over the set of connections, and the fibres should be viewed as $(d+A)$-twisted modules of $V$, generalizing the familiar notion of $g$-twisted modules. In fact, another application of our result is that it proposes an explicit definition of $(d+A)$-twisted modules of $V$ in terms of a twisted commutator formula, and we feel that this subject should be pursued further.
  Vertex algebras with big centers appear in practice as critical level or large level limits of vertex algebras. I particular we have in mind limits of the generalized quantum Langlands kernel, in which case $G$ is the Langland dual and $V$ is conjecturally the Feigin-Tipunin vertex algebra and the extension $\tilde{V}$ is conjecturally related to the Kac-DeConcini-Procesi quantum group with big center. With the current article, we can give a uniform and independent construction of these limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study renormalization, that is, the procedure for eliminating singularities, for a special model using both combinatorial techniques in the framework of working with formal series, and using a limit transition in a standard multidimensional integral, taking into account the removal of the singular components. Special attention is paid to the comparative analysis of the two views on the problem. It is remarkably that the divergences, which have the same form in one approach, acquire a different nature in another approach and lead to interesting consequences. A special deformation of the spectrum is used as regularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of the exact Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) analysis to two-level Floquet systems and establish a systematic procedure to calculate the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian. We show that, in the exact-WKB analysis, the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of cycle integrals (Voros symbol), which characterize monodromy matrices for Schr\"odinger-type differential equations governing two-level Floquet systems. We analytically evaluate the cycle integrals using the low-frequency expansion and derive both perturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian. To verify the accuracy of our results, we compare them with numerical calculations and analyze resonant oscillations, which reveal non-perturbative features that cannot be captured by the perturbative expansion.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the moduli space of Hermitian-Einstein connections on manifolds with a dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the moduli space of Hermitian-Einstein connections $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ of vector bundles over compact non-Gauduchon Hermitian manifolds $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$ that exhibit a dilaton field $\Phi$ admit a strong K\"ahler with torsion structure provided a certain condition is imposed on their Lee form $\theta$ and the dilaton. We find that the geometries that satisfy this condition include those that solve the string field equations or equivalently the gradient flow soliton type of equations. In addition, we demonstrate that if the underlying manifold $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$ admits a holomorphic and Killing vector field $X$ that leaves $\Phi$ also invariant, then the moduli spaces $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ admits an induced holomorphic and Killing vector field $\alpha_X$. Furthermore, if $X$ is covariantly constant with respect to the compatible connection $\hat\nabla$ with torsion a 3-form on $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$, then $\alpha_X$ is also covariantly constant with respect to the compatible connection $\hat D$ with torsion a 3-form on $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ provided that $K^\flat\wedge X^\flat$ is a $(1,1)$-form with $K^\flat=\theta+2d\Phi$ and $\Phi$ is invariant under $X$ and $IX$, where $I$ is the complex structure of $M^{2n}$.</description>

Abstract: We develop a formalism, based on spinor-helicity techniques, to generalize the formulation of partial wave unitarity bounds. We discuss unitarity bounds for $N \to M$ (with $N,M \geq 2$) scattering processes -- relevant for high-energy future colliders -- and spin-2 or higher-spin theories -- relevant for effective field theories of gravity -- that are not approachable by standard methods. Moreover, we emphasize the power and complementarity of positivity and partial wave unitarity bounds to constrain the parameter space of effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Thermodynamics and Lyapunov Exponents of Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills AdS Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills AdS black holes via the Euclidean path integral method, incorporating appropriate boundary and counterterms. By analyzing unstable timelike and null circular geodesics, we demonstrate that their Lyapunov exponents reflect the thermodynamic phase structure obtained from the Euclidean action. Specifically, the small-large black hole phase transition, analogous to a van der Waals fluid, is signaled by a discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent. Treating this discontinuity as an order parameter, we observe a universal critical exponent of $1/2$, consistent with mean-field theory. These results extend previous insights from black hole spacetimes with Abelian charges to scenarios involving nonlinear, non-Abelian gauge fields, highlighting the interplay between black hole thermodynamics and chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lee Yang edge singularities of QCD in association with Roberge-Weiss phase transition and chiral phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions in the complex chemical potential plane in the framework of Dyson-Schwinger equation approach, in the presence of a constant gluonic background field that represents confining dynamics. We solve the quark gap equation and the background field equation self consistently, which allows us to directly explore the confinement phase transition and furthermore, evaluate the impact of the back-coupling of confinement on chiral symmetry breaking. Moreover, within such a coupled framework towards the complex chemical potential region, we demonstrate the emergence of Roberge-Weiss (RW) symmetry and investigate the trajectory of Lee-Yang edge singularities (LYES). Our analysis reveals that the LYES scaling behavior is similar to our previous findings without the background field condensate. However, a significant difference from our earlier work is that the trajectory of LYES terminates when the imaginary part of the singularity becomes $1/3 \, \pi T$. We elaborate that this cut-off behavior is caused by the RW symmetry that is symmetric to the imaginary chemical potential $\mu_i=1/3 \, \pi T$.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Primordial Black Holes, Dimensionless Small Parameter, Inflationary Cosmology and Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work consideration is given to the primordial black holes ({\bf pbhs}) in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric with small mass (ultralight) in the preinflationary epoch. Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has been shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\bf qgcs}) to the characteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological parameters, shifting them compared with the semiclassical consideration. These contributions are determined by a series expansion in terms of a small parameter dependent on the hole mass (radius). For this pattern different cases have been considered (stationary, black hole evaporation...). It has been demonstrated that involvement of ({\bf qgcs}) leads to a higher probability for the occurrence of such {\bf pbhs}. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns. In the last section of this work it is introduced a study into the contributions generated by the above-mentioned {\bf qgcs} in inflationary cosmological perturbations. Besides, it has been shown that non-Gaussianity of these perturbations is higher as compared to the semi-classical pattern.</description>

      <title>Two-loop Feynman integrals for leading colour $t\bar{t}W$ production at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute a complete set of the two-loop Feynman integrals that are required for the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to on-shell top-pair production in association with a $W$ boson at hadron colliders in the leading colour approximation. These Feynman integrals also contribute to Higgs or $Z$-boson production in association with a top pair. We employ the method of differential equations (DEs), facilitated by the use of finite field methods to handle the algebraic complexity stemming from the seven-scale kinematics. The presence of the top quark in the virtual propagators, in addition to the mass of the external $W$ boson, gives rise to nested square roots and three elliptic curves. We obtain DEs that depend at most quadratically on the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$ for sectors where these analytic structures appear, and are $\epsilon$-factorised otherwise. We express the DEs in terms of a minimal set of differential one-forms, separating the logarithmic ones. We solve the DEs numerically in the physical kinematic region, with the method of generalised power series expansions.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models from a perspective of their application to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class.</description>

      <title>Radiative properties of a nonsingular black hole: Hawking radiation and gray-body factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the radiative properties of a spherical and singularity-free black-hole geometry recently proposed in the literature. Contrary to the Schwarzschild spacetime, this geometry is geodesically complete and regular, and, instead of the singularity, it presents a minimal surface that connects a trapped (black-hole) with an antitrapped (white-hole) region. The geometry is characterized by two parameters: the Schwarzschild radius and another parameter that measures the area of the minimal surface. This parameter is related to certain corrections expected in the context of loop quantum gravity to the classical general-relativistic dynamics. We explicitly compute the spectrum of the Hawking radiation and the gray-body factor. Since the gravitational potential is shallower than in Schwarzschild, the emission spectrum turns out be colder and purer (less gray). From this, we sketch the evaporation history of this geometry and conclude that, instead of completely evaporating, it naturally leads to a remnant, which provides a possible resolution of the information loss issue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, well-defined four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity by applying a dimensional regularization procedure. The resulting theory is a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class. We then consider the static spherically symmetric solutions of this theory and find black hole solutions that acquire primary hair. Notably, one of the integration constants associated with the Proca field is not manifest in the original metric, but under a disformal transformation of the seed solution, it emerges as a second, independent primary hair. This additional hair acts as an effective cosmological constant in the disformed geometry, even in the absence of a bare cosmological constant term. We further generalize these black hole solutions to include electromagnetic charges and effects related to the scalar-tensor counterparts of the regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory. We discuss the implications of our findings to observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave anisotropies from axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important prediction of inflation is the production of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background. Observing this background is challenging due to the weakness of the signal and the simultaneous presence of an astrophysical background generated by many unresolved late-time sources. One possible way to distinguish between the two is to examine their anisotropies. In this paper we calculate the primordial correlation function of gravitational wave anisotropies in the cosmological background generated by axion inflation, where the inflaton is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to gauge fields. In this scenario, tensor modes arise not only from the standard amplification of vacuum fluctuations present in any inflationary model, but also from the inverse decay process of the produced gauge fields. The correlator of gravitational wave anisotropies consists therefore of two main components: the contribution from vacuum tensor modes and the contribution from tensor modes sourced by the gauge fields. Our analysis shows that, while the former, previously studied in the literature, is negligible, the one arising from the sourced tensor modes, normalized by the fractional energy density at interferometer frequencies, can reach values as large as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This result shows that axion inflation can generate large anisotropies with the potential to be observed by gravitational wave detectors within a reasonable time frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.08934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pose and resolve a holographic puzzle regarding an apparent violation of causality in AdS/CFT. If a point in the bulk of $AdS$ moves at the speed of light, the boundary subregion that encodes it may need to move superluminally to keep up. With $AdS_3$ as our main example, we prove that the finite extent of the encoding regions prevents a paradox. We show that the length of the minimal-size encoding interval gives rise to a tortoise coordinate on $\mathrm{AdS}$ that measures the nonlocality of the encoding. We use this coordinate to explore circular and radial motion in the bulk before passing to the analysis of bulk null geodesics. For these null geodesics, there is always a critical encoding where the possible violation of causality is barely avoided. We show that in any other encoding, the possible violation is subcritical.</description>

Abstract: We investigate solutions of a new $4D$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity ($4D$ $EGB$). We first describe the bulk vacuum solution, then we add a massive probe scalar field, and we follow considering a self-interacting scalar field which acts as a source to support thick brane solutions in the four-dimensional $EGB$ scenario with a single extra dimension of infinite extent. We illustrate our results with some distinct brane-like configurations engendering controllable thickness. It is noteworthy that such configurations are simultaneous solutions in both versions of the modified theory of gravity, the original Glavan and Lin formulation and the regularized $4D$ $EGB$.</description>

      <title>Infinite Temperature is Not So Infinite: The Many Temperatures of de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several distinct concepts of temperature appear in the holographic description of de Sitter space. Conflating these has led to confusion and inconsistent claims. The double-scaled limit of SYK is a concrete model in which we can examine and explain these different concepts of temperature. This note began as an addendum to our paper ``Comments on a Paper by Narovlansky and Verlinde" but in the process of writing it we learned new things -- interesting in their own right -- that we wish to report here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that develops the mathematical framework necessary for studying field theories on ``T-Minkowski'' noncommutative spacetimes. These spacetimes constitute a class of noncommutative geometries, introduced in Part I, that are each invariant under distinct quantum group deformations of the Poincar\'e group. All these noncommutative geometries possess certain physically desirable characteristics, which allow me to develop all the tools of differential geometry and functional analysis, that are necessary in order to build consistent and T-Poincar\'e invariant noncommutative classical field theories.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dual of Crosscap Conformal Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a holographic dual for 2D CFT defined on closed non-orientable manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and the Klein bottle $\mathbb{K}^2$. Such CFT can be constructed by introducing antipodally identified cuttings, i.e. crosscaps, to a sphere and hence called crosscap CFT (XCFT). The gravity dual is AdS$_3$ spacetime with dS$_2$ end-of-the-world branes. In particular, the Lorentzian spacetime with a global dS$_2$ brane is dual to the unitary time evolution of a crosscap state in CFT, post-selected on the CFT ground state. We compute the holographic $\mathbb{RP}^2$ partition function (or the $p$-function), one-point function, and $\mathbb{K}^2$ partition function, and see that they successfully reproduce the XCFT results. We also show a holographic $p$-theorem as an application.</description>

Abstract: We compute the scalar determinants $\det(\Delta+M^{2})$ on the two-dimensional round disks of constant curvature $R=0$, $\mp 2$, for any finite boundary length $\ell$ and mass $M$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, using the $\zeta$-function prescription. When $M^{2}=\pm q(q+1)$, $q\in\mathbb N$, a simple expression involving only elementary functions and the Euler $\Gamma$ function is found. Applications to two-dimensional Liouville and Jackiw-Teitelboim quantum gravity are presented in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Holographic Hagedorn Temperature: Strong Coupling, Flavor and $\theta$-angle Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hagedorn temperature $T_H$ of strongly coupled quantum field theories admitting a holographic string or M-theory description in various regimes and scenarios.
  In the first part of the paper we propose a ``thermal scalar'' effective approach to the calculation of $T_H$ in eleven-dimensional supergravity. The proposal allows to extend the existing results for $T_H$ to the strongly coupled string regime, i.e. to a previously unexplored regime of field theory parameters where the number of colors $N$ is smaller than (some power of) the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$. We can thus extend the existing results for the $\alpha'$ expansion of the ABJM model, which have a spectacular agreement with predictions from integrability, in a different direction in parameter space. In particular, we explicitate the first non-perturbative corrections. We also apply the formalism to the Witten-Yang-Mills model, finding that the result for the ratio of $T_H$ with the deconfinement temperature is in the same ballpark of the lattice one for pure Yang-Mills. Within the same model, we study the dependence of the Hagedorn temperature on the $\theta$-angle.
  In the second part of the paper we analyze the effect of dynamical flavors on $T_H$ in confining theories. By studying the few available examples of regular backgrounds dual to confining theories with flavors, we find that generally the effects of flavors is to reduce the value of $T_H$ in units of the square root of the confining string tension. The effect turns out to be milder than the analogous reduction of the critical temperature for deconfinement when the latter is known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of us (L.S.) and H. Verlinde independently conjectured a holographic duality between the double-scaled SYK model at infinite temperature and dimensionally reduced $(2+1)$-dimensional de Sitter space [1]-[8]. Beyond the statement that such a duality exists there was deep disagreement between the two proposals [9]. In this note, we trace the origin of the disagreement to a superficial similarity between two q-deformed algebraic structures: the algebra of "chords" in DSSYK, and the algebra of line operators in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D de Sitter gravity. Assuming that these two structures are the same requires an identification of parameters [7][10] which leads to a collapse of the separation of scales [9] -- the separation being required by the semiclassical limit [3][9]. Dropping that assumption restores the separation of scales but leaves unexplained the relation between chords and Chern-Simons line operators. In this note we point out the existence of a third q-deformed algebra that appears in DSSYK: the algebra of ``wee-chords." Identifying the Chern-Simons line operators with wee-chords removes the discrepancy and leads to a satisfying relation between the two sides of the duality.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an equivariant deformation of the $B$ model on the sphere with a $U(1)$-action. We present the deformed supersymmetry transformations and corresponding Lagrangians and study observables in the supercharge cohomology. The inclusion of equivariance allows for the introduction of novel, position-dependent observables on the sphere, which have no counterparts in the conventional $B$ model. Two specific cases we explore in detail are position-dependent superpotentials and complex structure deformations. In both instances, the theory exhibits notable differences from the standard $B$ model, revealing intriguing new features.</description>

Abstract: Generalized symmetries of quantum field theories can be characterized by topological defects/operators organized into a higher category. In this paper we consider the Axion-Maxwell field theory in four dimensions and, building on the construction of its topological defects by Choi, Lam, Shao, Hidaka, Nitta and Yokokura, we discuss field theoretical methods to compute some aspects of the higher structure of such category. In particular, we determine explicitly the generalized F-symbols for the non-invertible electric 1-form symmetry of the theory. Along the way, we clarify various aspects of the bottom-up worldvolume approach towards the calculus of defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.</description>

Abstract: The sphere partition function is one of the simplest euclidean gravity computations. It is usually interpreted as count of states. However, the one loop gravity correction contains a dimension dependent phase factor, $i^{D+2}$, which seems confusing for such an interpretation. We show that, after including an observer, this phase gets mostly cancelled for the quantity that should correspond to a count of states. However, an overall minus sign remains.</description>

      <title>Analytic bootstrap bounds on masses and spins in gravitational and non-gravitational scalar theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive analytic constraints on the weakly-coupled spectrum of theories with a massless scalar under the standard assumptions of the S-matrix bootstrap program. These bootstrap bounds apply to any theory (with or without gravity) with fully crossing symmetric (i.e. $stu$-symmetric) four-point amplitudes and generalize results for color- or flavor-ordered (i.e. $su$-symmetric) planar amplitudes recently proved by one of the authors. We assume that the theory is weakly-coupled below some cut-off, that the four-point massless scalar amplitude is polynomially-bounded in the Regge limit, and that this amplitude exchanges states with a discrete set of masses and a finite set of spins at each mass level. The spins and masses must then satisfy ``Sequential Spin Constraints" (SSC) and ``Sequential Mass Constraints" (SMC). The SSC requires the lightest spin-$j$ state to be lighter than the lightest spin-$(j+1)$ state (in the $su$-symmetric case) or the lightest spin-$(j+2)$ state (in the $stu$-symmetric case). The SMC requires the mass of the lightest spin-$j$ state to be smaller than some non-linear function of the masses of lower-spin states. Our results also apply to super-gluon and super-graviton amplitudes stripped of their polarization dependence. In particular, the open and closed superstring spectra saturate the SSC with maximum spins ${J_{n,\text{open}} = n+1}$ and ${J_{n,\text{closed}} = 2n+2}$, respectively, at the $n^\text{th}$ mass level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An enhanced version of the conformal BMS$_{3}$ algebra is presented. It is shown to emerge from the asymptotic structure of an extension of conformal gravity in 3D by Pope and Townsend that consistently accommodates an additional spin-2 field, once it is endowed with a suitable set of boundary conditions. The canonical generators of the asymptotic symmetries then span a precise nonlinear W$_{(2,2,2,2,1,1,1)}$ algebra, whose central extensions and coefficients of the nonlinear terms are completely determined by the central charge of the Virasoro subalgebra. The wedge algebra corresponds to the conformal group in four dimensions $SO(4,2)$ and therefore, enhanced conformal BMS$_{3}$ can also be regarded as an infinite-dimensional nonlinear extension of the AdS$_{5}$ algebra with nontrivial central extensions. It is worth mentioning that our boundary conditions might be considered as a starting point in order to consistently incorporate either a finite or an infinite number of conformal higher spin fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two kinds of resonance soliton solutions on the Ultrahyperbolic space $\mathbb{U}$ for the G=U(2) Yang equation, which is equivalent to the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills (ASDYM) equation. We reveal and illustrate the solitonic behaviors in the four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW$_4$) model through the sigma model action densities. The Yang equation is the equation of motion of the WZW$_4$ model. In the case of $\mathbb{U}$, the WZW$_4$ model describes a string field theory action of open N=2 string theories. Hence, our solutions on $\mathbb{U}$ suggest the existence of the corresponding classical objects in the N=2 string theories. Our solutions include multiple-pole solutions and V-shape soliton solutions. The V-shape solitons suggest annihilation and creation processes of two solitons and would be building blocks to classify the ASDYM solitons, like the role of Y-shape solitons in classification of the KP (line) solitons.
  We also clarify the relationship between the Cauchy matrix approach and the binary Darboux transformation in terms of quasideterminants. Our formalism can start with a simpler input data for the soliton solutions and hence might give a suitable framework for the classification of the ASDYM solitons.</description>

      <title>Unitary Rigid Supersymmetry for the Chiral Graviton and Chiral Gravitino in de Sitter Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that a unitary supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) involving graviton and gravitino fields on fixed 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime ($dS_{4}$) cannot exist due to known challenges associated with supersymmetry (SUSY) in $dS_{4}$. In this paper, we contradict this expectation by presenting a new unitary supersymmetric QFT on $dS_{4}$: the free supersymmetric theory of the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino fields. By chiral, we mean that the corresponding field strengths are anti-self-dual, and the gauge potentials are complex, each carrying a single complex propagating degree of freedom. The global SUSY transformations are generated by the standard Dirac Killing spinors of $dS_{4}$. The theory overcomes the known obstacles to unitary global SUSY on $dS_{4}$ by closing the commutator between two SUSY transformations on $so(4,2) \oplus u(1)$ rather than the de Sitter algebra $so(4,1)$. Crucially, the $so(4,2)$ symmetry is realised through unconventional conformal-like transformations. This free theory cannot become interacting while preserving SUSY in a way that makes the spin-2 sector the true graviton sector of General Relativity, as the three-graviton coupling cannot be $u(1)$-invariant. We establish the unitarity of the free supersymmetric theory in two complementary ways. First, by studying the action of the superalgebra generators on the space of physical gravitino and graviton mode solutions. Second, by quantising the fields and explicitly constructing the complex quantum supercharges $Q_{A}$ and $Q^{A\dagger}$, we show that the trace $\sum_{A} \{ Q_{A}, Q^{A \dagger} \}$ is positive-definite.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Topological Field Theory for Flavor Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we demonstrate that the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) associated to a Quantum Field Theory (QFT) with continuous non-abelian $G$-flavor symmetry is a $BF$-theory with gauge group $G$. We show that gauging $G$-symmetry with a flat connection yields a theory with global symmetry characterized by exchanging the conjugate variables in the quantization of $BF$-theory. We construct the extended operators that generate the $G$-flavor symmetry and the $(d-2)$-form $\text{Rep}(G)$-symmetry of the gauged QFT. We demonstrate that $BF$-theory arises as the theory characterizing $G$-flavor symmetry of a QFT in the AdS/CFT setup. 't Hooft anomalies of the $G$-flavor symmetry are realized as extra terms in the action.</description>

      <title>Tame Embeddings, Volume Growth, and Complexity of Moduli Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravity is expected to impose constraints on the moduli spaces of massless fields that can arise in effective quantum field theories. A recent proposal asserts that the asymptotic volume growth of these spaces is severely restricted, and related to the existence of duality symmetries. In this work we link this proposal to a tameness criterion, by suggesting that any consistent moduli space should admit a tame isometric embedding into Euclidean space. This allows us to promote the volume growth constraint to a local condition, and give the growth coefficient a geometric interpretation in terms of complexity. We study the implications of this proposal for the emergence of dualities, as well as for the curvature and infinite distance limits of moduli spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the energy-momentum tensor of a baryon in a top-down holographic QCD. In holographic QCD, the baryons are represented as solitons in a 5-dimensional gauge theory. We obtain the soliton solution by solving the equations of motion numerically. Using this result, the energy-momentum tensor and related quantities such as the mass, mean square radii, and the D-term (druck term) are computed. The evaluated D-term is about -2.05, whose absolute value is significantly larger than that in the previous work arXiv:2206.06578.</description>

      <title>The spinning self-force EFT: 1SF waveform recursion relation and Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on recent approaches, we develop an effective field theory for the interaction of spinning particles modeling Kerr black holes within the gravitational self-force expansion. To incorporate dimensional regularization into this framework, we analyze the Myers-Perry black hole and its particle description, obtaining a novel form of the corresponding linearized stress tensor. We then derive the 1SF self-force effective action up to quadratic order in the spin expansion, identifying a new type of spinning recoil term that arises from integrating out the heavy dynamics. Next, we study the 1SF metric perturbation both from the traditional self-force perspective and through the diagrammatic background field expansion, making contact with the radiative waveform. This leads us to consider a novel recursion relation for the curved space 1SF Compton amplitude, which we study up to one-loop in the wave regime and compare with the flat space one-loop Compton amplitude for Kerr up to quadratic order in spin. Finally, we investigate the 1SF spinning Compton amplitude in the eikonal regime, clarifying how strong-field effects -- such as the location of the separatrix -- emerge from the resummation of the perturbative weak-field expansion.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>A quantum deformation of the ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unital associative algebra ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$, having $q$ and $k$ as complex parameters, generated by the elements $K^\pm_m$ ($\pm m\geq 0$), $T_m$ ($m\in \mathbb{Z}$), and $G^\pm_m$ ($m\in \mathbb{Z}+{1\over 2}$ in the Neveu-Schwarz sector, $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ in the Ramond sector), satisfying relations which are at most quartic. Calculations of some low-lying Kac determinants are made, providing us with a conjecture for the factorization property of the Kac determinants. The analysis of the screening operators gives a supporting evidence for our conjecture. It is shown that by taking the limit $q\rightarrow 1$ of ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$ we recover the ordinary ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal algebra. We also give a nontrivial Heisenberg representation of the algebra ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$, making a twist of the $U(1)$ boson in the Wakimoto representation of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$, which naturally follows from the construction of ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$ by gluing the deformed $Y$-algebras of Gaiotto and Rap$\check{\mathrm{c}}$\'{a}k.</description>

Abstract: Lie algebras formed via semi-direct sums of the Witt algebra $\text{Der}(\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}])$ and its modules have become increasingly prominent in both physics and mathematics in recent years. In this paper, we complete the study of (Leibniz) central extensions, derivations and automorphisms of the Lie algebras formed from the semi-direct sum of the Witt algebra and its indecomposable intermediate series modules (that is, graded modules with one-dimensional graded components). Our techniques exploit the internal grading of the Witt algebra, which can be applied to a wider class of graded Lie algebras.</description>

Abstract: We examine the vacuum state and its corresponding renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) in static horizonless regular spacetime in both two and four dimensions. Using the local field formulation of the anomaly-induced effective action, we show that the regularities of the spacetime and the RSET dictate the appropriate vacuum state. Furthermore, through a case study under the horizonless Bardeen-type spacetime, we demonstrate that the preferred vacuum state is not the Boulware vacuum, but a nontrivial one with a different RSET profile.</description>

      <title>Dualities between 2+1d fusion surface models from braided fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fusion surface models generalize the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, utilizing fusion 2-categories as their input. We investigate bond-algebraic dualities in these systems and show that distinct module tensor categories $\mathcal{M}$ over the same braided fusion category $\mathcal{B}$ give rise to dual lattice models. This extends the 1+1d result that dualities in anyon chains are classified by module categories over fusion categories. We analyze two concrete examples: (i) a $\text{Rep}(S_3)$ model with a constrained Hilbert space, dual to the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ XXZ model on the honeycomb lattice, and (ii) a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model, dual to a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ model with XXZ and Ising interactions. Unlike regular $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{B}$ fusion surface models, which conserve only 1-form symmetries, models constructed from $\mathcal{M} \neq \mathcal{B}$ can exhibit both 1-form and 0-form symmetries, including non-invertible ones.</description>

Abstract: We describe the scattering of particles by a sandwich gravitational wave generated during a flyby using an analytical approach. The derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking is approximated by the hyperbolic scarf potential, which allows for an exact analytic solution via the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our results confirm the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev about certain ``magical" amplitudes of the potential.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between accelerated probes in de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>

      <title>A Majorana Relativistic Quantum Spectral Approach to the Riemann Hypothesis in (1+1)-Dimensional Rindler Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the Hilbert-P\'olya approach to the Riemann Hypothesis, we present an exact spectral realization of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(z)$ with a Mellin-Barnes integral that explicitly contains it. This integral defines the spectrum of the real-valued energy eigenvalues $E_n$ of a Majorana particle in a $(1+1)$-dimensional Rindler spacetime or equivalent Kaluza-Klein reductions of $(n+1)$-dimensional geometries. We show that the Hamiltonian $H_M$ describing the particle is hermitian and the spectrum of energy eigenvalues $\{E_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is countably infinite in number in a bijective correspondence with the imaginary part of the nontrivial zeros of $\zeta(z)$ having the same cardinality as required by Hardy-Littlewood's theorem from number theory. The correspondence between the two spectra with the essential self-adjointness of $H_M$, confirmed with deficiency index analysis, boundary triplet theory and Krein's extension theorem, imply that all nontrivial zeros have real part $\Re ( z )=1/2$, i.e., lie on the ``critical line''. In the framework of noncommutative geometry, $H_M$ is interpreted as a Dirac operator $D$ in a spectral triple $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, D)$, linking these results to Connes' program for the Riemann Hypothesis. The algebra $\mathcal{A}$ encodes the modular symmetries underlying the spectral realization of $\zeta (z)$ in the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of Majorana wavefunctions, integrating concepts from quantum mechanics, general relativity, and number theory. This analysis offers a promising Hilbert-P\'olya-inspired path to prove the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>
