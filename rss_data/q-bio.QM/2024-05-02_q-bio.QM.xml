      <title>Bayesian-Guided Generation of Synthetic Microbiomes with Minimized Pathogenicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic microbiomes offer new possibilities for modulating microbiota, to address the barriers in multidtug resistance (MDR) research. We present a Bayesian optimization approach to enable efficient searching over the space of synthetic microbiome variants to identify candidates predictive of reduced MDR. Microbiome datasets were encoded into a low-dimensional latent space using autoencoders. Sampling from this space allowed generation of synthetic microbiome signatures. Bayesian optimization was then implemented to select variants for biological screening to maximize identification of designs with restricted MDR pathogens based on minimal samples. Four acquisition functions were evaluated: expected improvement, upper confidence bound, Thompson sampling, and probability of improvement. Based on each strategy, synthetic samples were prioritized according to their MDR detection. Expected improvement, upper confidence bound, and probability of improvement consistently produced synthetic microbiome candidates with significantly fewer searches than Thompson sampling. By combining deep latent space mapping and Bayesian learning for efficient guided screening, this study demonstrated the feasibility of creating bespoke synthetic microbiomes with customized MDR profiles.</description>

      <title>3D MR Fingerprinting for Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Imaging of Whole Mouse Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative MRI enables direct quantification of contrast agent concentrations in contrast-enhanced scans. However, the lengthy scan times required by conventional methods are inadequate for tracking contrast agent transport dynamically in mouse brain. We developed a 3D MR fingerprinting (MRF) method for simultaneous T1 and T2 mapping across the whole mouse brain with 4.3-min temporal resolution. We designed a 3D MRF sequence with variable acquisition segment lengths and magnetization preparations on a 9.4T preclinical MRI scanner. Model-based reconstruction approaches were employed to improve the accuracy and speed of MRF acquisition. The method's accuracy for T1 and T2 measurements was validated in vitro, while its repeatability of T1 and T2 measurements was evaluated in vivo (n=3). The utility of the 3D MRF sequence for dynamic tracking of intracisternally infused Gd-DTPA in the whole mouse brain was demonstrated (n=5). Phantom studies confirmed accurate T1 and T2 measurements by 3D MRF with an undersampling factor up to 48. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRF scans achieved a spatial resolution of 192 x 192 x 500 um3 and a temporal resolution of 4.3 min, allowing for the analysis and comparison of dynamic changes in concentration and transport kinetics of intracisternally infused Gd-DTPA across brain regions. The sequence also enabled highly repeatable, high-resolution T1 and T2 mapping of the whole mouse brain (192 x 192 x 250 um3) in 30 min. We present the first dynamic and multi-parametric approach for quantitatively tracking contrast agent transport in the mouse brain using 3D MRF.</description>

      <title>Discovering intrinsic multi-compartment pharmacometric models using Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pharmacometric models are pivotal across drug discovery and development, playing a decisive role in determining the progression of candidate molecules. However, the derivation of mathematical equations governing the system is a labor-intensive trial-and-error process, often constrained by tight timelines. In this study, we introduce PKINNs, a novel purely data-driven pharmacokinetic-informed neural network model. PKINNs efficiently discovers and models intrinsic multi-compartment-based pharmacometric structures, reliably forecasting their derivatives. The resulting models are both interpretable and explainable through Symbolic Regression methods. Our computational framework demonstrates the potential for closed-form model discovery in pharmacometric applications, addressing the labor-intensive nature of traditional model derivation. With the increasing availability of large datasets, this framework holds the potential to significantly enhance model-informed drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Hierarchical Multi-Label Classifier Based on Local Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scarcity of labeled data is a common problem in supervised classification, since hand-labeling can be time consuming, expensive or hard to label; on the other hand, large amounts of unlabeled information can be found. The problem of scarcity of labeled data is even more notorious in hierarchical classification, because the data of a node is split among its children, which results in few instances associated to the deepest nodes of the hierarchy. In this work it is proposed the semi-supervised hierarchical multi-label classifier based on local information (SSHMC-BLI) which can be trained with labeled and unlabeled data to perform hierarchical classification tasks. The method can be applied to any type of hierarchical problem, here we focus on the most difficult case: hierarchies of DAG type, where the instances can be associated to multiple paths of labels which can finish in an internal node. SSHMC-BLI builds pseudo-labels for each unlabeled instance from the paths of labels of its labeled neighbors, while it considers whether the unlabeled instance is similar to its neighbors. Experiments on 12 challenging datasets from functional genomics show that making use of unlabeled along with labeled data can help to improve the performance of a supervised hierarchical classifier trained only on labeled data, even with statistical significance.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Active Subspaces to Capture Epistemic Model Uncertainty in Deep Generative Models for Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have been accelerating the inverse design process in material and drug design. Unlike their counterpart property predictors in typical molecular design frameworks, generative molecular design models have seen fewer efforts on uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to computational challenges in Bayesian inference posed by their large number of parameters. In this work, we focus on the junction-tree variational autoencoder (JT-VAE), a popular model for generative molecular design, and address this issue by leveraging the low dimensional active subspace to capture the uncertainty in the model parameters. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the active subspace parameters to estimate the epistemic model uncertainty in an extremely high dimensional parameter space. The proposed UQ scheme does not require alteration of the model architecture, making it readily applicable to any pre-trained model. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the AS-based UQ and its potential impact on molecular optimization by exploring the model diversity under epistemic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Distinguishability of Markovian Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to distinguish between stochastic systems based on their trajectories is crucial in thermodynamics, chemistry, and biophysics. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$, quantifies the distinguishability between the two ensembles of length-$\tau$ trajectories from Markov processes A and B. However, evaluating $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$ from histograms of trajectories faces sufficient sampling difficulties, and no theory explicitly reveals what dynamical features contribute to the distinguishability. This letter provides a general formula that decomposes $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$ in space and time for any Markov processes, arbitrarily far from equilibrium or steady state. It circumvents the sampling difficulty of evaluating $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$. Furthermore, it explicitly connects trajectory KL divergence with individual transition events and their waiting time statistics. The results provide insights into understanding distinguishability between Markov processes, leading to new theoretical frameworks for designing biological sensors and optimizing signal transduction.</description>
