      <title>Bernstein polynomials: a bibliometric data analysis since the year 1949 based on the Scopus database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It's hard to imagine human life in the digital and AI age without polynomials because they are everywhere but mostly invisible to ordinary people: in data trends, on computer screens, in the shapes around us, and in the very fabric of technology. One of these, the simple but elegant Bernstein polynomials, was discovered by a scientist from the Russian Empire, Sergei Bernstein, in 1912 and plays a central role in mathematical analysis, computational and applied mathematics, geometric modelling, computer-aided geometric design, computer graphics and other areas of science and engineering. They have been the sub-ject of much research for over a hundred years. However, no work has carried out database-derived research analysis, such as bibliometric, keyword or network analysis, or more generally, data analysis of manuscript data related to Bernstein polynomials extracted from digital academic databases. This work, which appears to be the first-ever attempt at the bibliometric data analysis of Bernstein polynomials, aims to fill this gap and open researchers' eyes to potentially new or underexplored areas of mathematics and engineering where Bernstein polynomials may one day be used to make discoveries. The results may be helpful to academics researching Bernstein polynomials and looking for potential applications, collaborators, supervisors, funding or journals to publish in.</description>

      <title>Consonance in music -- the Pythagorean approach revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pythagorean school attributed consonance in music to simplicity of frequency ratios between musical tones. In the last two centuries, the consonance curves developed by Helmholtz, Plompt and Levelt shifted focus to psycho-acoustic considerations in perceiving consonances. The appearance of peaks of these curves at the ratios considered by the Pythagorean school, and which were a consequence of an attempt to understand the world by nice mathematical proportions, remained a curiosity. This paper addresses this curiosity, by describing a mathematical model of musical sound, along with a mathematical definition of consonance. First, we define pure, complex and mixed tones as mathematical models of musical sound. By a sequence of numerical experiments and analytic calculations, we show that continuous cosine similarity, abbreviated as cosim, applied to these models quantifies the elusive concept of consonance as a frequency ratio which gives a local maximum of the cosim function. We prove that these maxima occur at the ratios considered as consonant in classical music theory. Moreover, we provide a simple explanation why the number of musical intervals considered as consonant by musicians is finite, but has been increasing over the centuries. Specifically, our formulas show that the number of consonant intervals changes with the depth of the tone (the number of harmonics present).</description>
