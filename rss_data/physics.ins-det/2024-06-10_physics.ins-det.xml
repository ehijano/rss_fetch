      <title>Upgrade of the online data quality monitoring system for future PandaX experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PandaX-4T is a xenon-based multi-purpose experiment, focusing on particle and astrophysics research. The data quality monitoring system plays a crucial role in the experiment. This system enables the prompt detection of potential issues during data collection. In order to meet the upgrade requirements of the experiment, we have implemented several updates to improve overall data throughput and provide users with more comprehensive information. As a result, the system is capable of monitoring half of the collected data in future operations of the PandaX-4T experiment. Furthermore, with updated hardware, the system is also well-equipped to meet the requirements of the future multi-ten-tonne level PandaX-xT experiment.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of 400 GeV/c proton interactions with the SHiP-charm project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SHiP-charm project was proposed to measure the associated charm production induced by 400 GeV/c protons in a thick target, including the contribution from cascade production. An optimisation run was performed in July 2018 at CERN SPS using a hybrid setup. The high resolution of nuclear emulsions acting as vertex detector was complemented by electronic detectors for kinematic measurements and muon identification. Here we present first results on the analysis of nuclear emulsions exposed in the 2018 run, which prove the capability of reconstructing proton interaction vertices in a harsh environment, where the signal is largely dominated by secondary particles produced in hadronic and electromagnetic showers within the lead target.</description>

      <title>ALICE upgrades during the LHC Long Shutdown 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) has been conceived and constructed as a heavy-ion experiment at the LHC. During LHC Runs 1 and 2, it has produced a wide range of physics results using all collision systems available at the LHC. In order to best exploit new physics opportunities opening up with the upgraded LHC and new detector technologies, the experiment has undergone a major upgrade during the LHC Long Shutdown 2 (2019-2022). This comprises the move to continuous readout, the complete overhaul of core detectors, as well as a new online event processing farm with a redesigned online-offline software framework. These improvements will allow to record Pb-Pb collisions at rates up to 50 kHz, while ensuring sensitivity for signals without a triggerable signature.</description>

      <title>The ATLAS Experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider: A Description of the Detector Configuration for Run 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ATLAS detector is installed in its experimental cavern at Point 1 of the CERN Large Hadron Collider. During Run 2 of the LHC, a luminosity of $\mathcal{L}=2\times 10^{34}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ was routinely achieved at the start of fills, twice the design luminosity. For Run 3, accelerator improvements, notably luminosity levelling, allow sustained running at an instantaneous luminosity of $\mathcal{L}=2\times 10^{34}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, with an average of up to 60 interactions per bunch crossing. The ATLAS detector has been upgraded to recover Run 1 single-lepton trigger thresholds while operating comfortably under Run 3 sustained pileup conditions. A fourth pixel layer 3.3 cm from the beam axis was added before Run 2 to improve vertex reconstruction and $b$-tagging performance. New Liquid Argon Calorimeter digital trigger electronics, with corresponding upgrades to the Trigger and Data Acquisition system, take advantage of a factor of 10 finer granularity to improve triggering on electrons, photons, taus, and hadronic signatures through increased pileup rejection. The inner muon endcap wheels were replaced by New Small Wheels with Micromegas and small-strip Thin Gap Chamber detectors, providing both precision tracking and Level-1 Muon trigger functionality. Tile Calorimeter scintillation counters were added to improve electron energy resolution and background rejection. Upgrades to Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators and Forward Detectors improve luminosity monitoring and enable total proton-proton cross section, diffractive physics, and heavy ion measurements. These upgrades are all compatible with operation in the much harsher environment anticipated after the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC and are the first steps towards preparing ATLAS for the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC. This paper describes the Run 3 configuration of the ATLAS detector.</description>

      <title>Front-end electronics development of large-area SiPM arrays for high-precision single-photon time measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT) plans to incorporate silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) with superior time resolution in addition to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) into its detection units, namely hybrid Digital Optical Modules (hDOMs), to improve its angular resolution. However, the time resolution significantly degrades for large-area SiPMs due to the large detector capacitance, posing significant challenges for the readout electronics of SiPMs in hDOM. We analyzed the influences of series and parallel connections when constructing a large-area SiPM array and designed a series-parallel connection SiPM array with differential output. We also designed a high-speed pre-amplifier based on transformers (MABA-007159) and radio frequency amplifiers (BGA2803), and an analog multi-channel summing circuit based on operational amplifiers (LMH6629). We measured the single photon time resolution (SPTR) of a $4\times4$ SiPM (Hamamatsu S13360-3050PE) array ($12\times12~\mathrm{mm}^2$) of approximately 300 ps FWHM. This front-end readout design enables the large-area SiPM array to achieve high-precision single photon time measurement in one readout channel.</description>
