      <title>Equitable Connected Partition and Structural Parameters Revisited: N-fold Beats Lenstra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Equitable Connected Partition (ECP for short) problem, where we are given a graph G=(V,E) together with an integer p, and our goal is to find a partition of V into p parts such that each part induces a connected sub-graph of G and the size of each two parts differs by at most 1. On the one hand, the problem is known to be NP-hard in general and W[1]-hard with respect to the path-width, the feedback-vertex set, and the number of parts p combined. On the other hand, fixed-parameter algorithms are known for parameters the vertex-integrity and the max leaf number.
  As our main contribution, we resolve a long-standing open question [Enciso et al.; IWPEC '09] regarding the parameterisation by the tree-depth of the underlying graph. In particular, we show that ECP is W[1]-hard with respect to the 4-path vertex cover number, which is an even more restrictive structural parameter than the tree-depth. In addition to that, we show W[1]-hardness of the problem with respect to the feedback-edge set, the distance to disjoint paths, and NP-hardness with respect to the shrub-depth and the clique-width. On a positive note, we propose several novel fixed-parameter algorithms for various parameters that are bounded for dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parallel Algorithms for Dendrogram Computation and Single-Linkage Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing a Single-Linkage Dendrogram (SLD) is a key step in the classic single-linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm. Given an input edge-weighted tree $T$, the SLD of $T$ is a binary dendrogram that summarizes the $n-1$ clusterings obtained by contracting the edges of $T$ in order of weight. Existing algorithms for computing the SLD all require $\Omega(n\log n)$ work where $n = |T|$. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge no prior work provides a parallel algorithm obtaining non-trivial speedup for this problem.
  In this paper, we design faster parallel algorithms for computing SLDs both in theory and in practice based on new structural results about SLDs. In particular, we obtain a deterministic output-sensitive parallel algorithm based on parallel tree contraction that requires $O(n \log h)$ work and $O(\log^2 n \log^2 h)$ depth, where $h$ is the height of the output SLD. We also give a deterministic bottom-up algorithm for the problem inspired by the nearest neighbor chain algorithm for hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and show that it achieves $O(n\log h)$ work and $O(h \log n)$ depth. Our results are based on a novel divide-and-conquer framework for building SLDs, inspired by divide-and-conquer algorithms for Cartesian trees. Our new algorithms can quickly compute the SLD on billion-scale trees, and obtain up to 150x speedup over the highly-efficient Union-Find algorithm typically used to compute SLDs in practice.</description>

      <title>$(\Delta + 1)$ Vertex Coloring in $O(n)$ Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the communication complexity of $(\Delta + 1)$ vertex coloring, where the edges of an $n$-vertex graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ are partitioned between two players. We provide a randomized protocol which uses $O(n)$ bits of communication and ends with both players knowing the coloring. Combining this with a folklore $\Omega(n)$ lower bound, this settles the randomized communication complexity of $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring up to constant factors.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Earliest and Fastest Paths in Public Transport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public transport administrators rely on efficient algorithms for various problems that arise in public transport networks. In particular, our study focused on designing linear-time algorithms for two fundamental path problems: the earliest arrival time (\textsc{eat}) and the fastest path duration (\textsc{fpd}) on public transportation data. We conduct a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art algorithms. The results are quite promising, indicating substantial efficiency improvements. Specifically, the fastest path problem shows a remarkable 34-fold speedup, while the earliest arrival time problem exhibits an even more impressive 183-fold speedup. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our algorithms to solve \textsc{eat} and \textsc{fpd} problems in public transport, and eventually help public administrators to enrich the urban transport experience.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology generalizations for Social Media Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study details an approach for the analysis of social media collected political data through the lens of Topological Data Analysis, with a specific focus on Persistent Homology and the political processes they represent by proposing a set of mathematical generalizations using Gaussian functions to define and analyze these Persistent Homology categories. Three distinct types of Persistent Homologies were recurrent across datasets that had been plotted through retweeting patterns and analyzed through the k-Nearest-Neighbor filtrations. As these Persistent Homologies continued to appear, they were then categorized and dubbed Nuclear, Bipolar, and Multipolar Constellations. Upon investigating the content of these plotted tweets, specific patterns of interaction and political information dissemination were identified, namely Political Personalism and Political Polarization. Through clustering and application of Gaussian density functions, I have mathematically characterized each category, encapsulating their distinctive topological features. The mathematical generalizations of Bipolar, Nuclear, and Multipolar Constellations developed in this study are designed to inspire other political science digital media researchers to utilize these categories as to identify Persistent Homology in datasets derived from various social media platforms, suggesting the broader hypothesis that such structures are bound to be present on political scraped data regardless of the social media it's derived from. This method aims to offer a new perspective in Network Analysis as it allows for an exploration of the underlying shape of the networks formed by retweeting patterns, enhancing the understanding of digital interactions within the sphere of Computational Social Sciences.</description>

      <title>A logarithmic approximation of linearly-ordered colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. We present a simple polynomial-time algorithm that finds an LO colouring with $\log_2(n)$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>

      <title>Small-Space Algorithms for the Online Language Distance Problem for Palindromes and Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the online variant of the language distance problem for two classical formal languages, the language of palindromes and the language of squares, and for the two most fundamental distances, the Hamming distance and the edit (Levenshtein) distance. In this problem, defined for a fixed formal language $L$, we are given a string $T$ of length $n$, and the task is to compute the minimal distance to $L$ from every prefix of $T$. We focus on the low-distance regime, where one must compute only the distances smaller than a given threshold $k$. In this work, our contribution is twofold:
  - First, we show streaming algorithms, which access the input string $T$ only through a single left-to-right scan. Both for palindromes and squares, our algorithms use $O(k \cdot\mathrm{poly}~\log n)$ space and time per character in the Hamming-distance case and $O(k^2 \cdot\mathrm{poly}~\log n)$ space and time per character in the edit-distance case. These algorithms are randomised by necessity, and they err with probability inverse-polynomial in $n$.
  - Second, we show deterministic read-only online algorithms, which are also provided with read-only random access to the already processed characters of $T$. Both for palindromes and squares, our algorithms use $O(k \cdot\mathrm{poly}~\log n)$ space and time per character in the Hamming-distance case and $O(k^4 \cdot\mathrm{poly}~\log n)$ space and amortised time per character in the edit-distance case.</description>

      <title>Edge-coloring sparse graphs with $\Delta$ colors in quasilinear time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that every graph $G$ of bounded maximum average degree ${\rm mad}(G)$ and with maximum degree $\Delta$ can be edge-colored using the optimal number of $\Delta$ colors in quasilinear time, whenever $\Delta\ge 2{\rm mad}(G)$. The maximum average degree is within a multiplicative constant of other popular graph sparsity parameters like arboricity, degeneracy or maximum density. Our algorithm extends previous results of Chrobak and Nishizeki [J. Algorithms, 1990] and Bhattacharya, Costa, Panski and Solomon [arXiv, 2023].</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for group testing in arbitrary hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent papers initiated the study of a generalization of group testing where the potentially contaminated sets are the members of a given hypergraph F=(V,E). This generalization finds application in contexts where contaminations can be conditioned by some kinds of social and geographical clusterings. The paper focuses on few-stage group testing algorithms, i.e., slightly adaptive algorithms where tests are performed in stages and all tests performed in the same stage should be decided at the very beginning of the stage. In particular, the paper presents the first two-stage algorithm that uses o(dlog|E|) tests for general hypergraphs with hyperedges of size at most d, and a three-stage algorithm that improves by a d^{1/6} factor on the number of tests of the best known three-stage algorithm. These algorithms are special cases of an s-stage algorithm designed for an arbitrary positive integer s&lt;= d. The design of this algorithm resort to a new non-adaptive algorithm (one-stage algorithm), i.e., an algorithm where all tests must be decided beforehand. Further, we derive a lower bound for non-adaptive group testing. For E sufficiently large, the lower bound is very close to the upper bound on the number of tests of the best non-adaptive group testing algorithm known in the literature, and it is the first lower bound that improves on the information theoretic lower bound Omega(log |E|).</description>

      <title>Problems in NP can Admit Double-Exponential Lower Bounds when Parameterized by Treewidth or Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treewidth (tw) is an important parameter that, when bounded, yields tractability for many problems. For example, graph problems expressible in Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic and QUANTIFIED SAT or, more generally, QUANTIFIED CSP, are FPT parameterized by the tw of the input's (primal) graph plus the length of the MSO-formula [Courcelle, Information &amp; Computation 1990] and the quantifier rank [Chen, ECAI 2004], resp. The algorithms from these (meta-)results have running times whose dependence on tw is a tower of exponents. A conditional lower bound by Fichte et al. [LICS 2020] shows that, for QUANTIFIED SAT, the height of this tower is equal to the number of quantifier alternations. Lower bounds showing that at least double-exponential factors in the running time are necessary are rare: there are very few (for tw and vertex cover vc parameterizations) and they are for problems that are complete for #NP, $\Sigma_2^p$, $\Pi_2^p$, or higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.
  We show, for the first time, that it is not necessary to go higher up in the polynomial hierarchy to obtain such lower bounds. We design a novel, yet simple versatile technique based on Sperner families to obtain such lower bounds and apply it to 3 problems: METRIC DIMENSION, STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, and GEODETIC SET. We prove that they do not admit $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithms, even on bounded diameter graphs, unless the ETH fails. For STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, the lower bound holds even for vc. We complement our lower bounds with matching upper bounds.</description>
