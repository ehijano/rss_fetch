      <title>A Self-Consistent Model of Kinetic Alfven Solitons in Pulsar Wind Plasma: Linking Soliton Characteristics to Pulsar Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent model for the formation and propagation of kinetic Alfven (KA) solitons in the pulsar wind zone, where a relativistic, magnetized electron positron ion plasma flows along open magnetic field lines beyond the light cylinder. Using a reductive perturbation approach, we derive a Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation that governs the nonlinear evolution of KA solitons in this environment. The soliton amplitude and width are shown to depend sensitively on key pulsar observables, including spin period, spin-down rate, and pair multiplicity as well as plasma composition and suprathermal particle distributions. Our analysis reveals that soliton structures are strongly influenced by the presence of heavy ions, kappa-distributed pairs, and oblique propagation angles. Heavier ion species such as Fe26+ produce significantly broader solitons due to enhanced inertia and dispersion, while increasing pair multiplicity leads to smaller solitons through stronger screening. Oblique propagation (larger theta) results in wider but lower-amplitude solitons, and more thermalized pair plasmas (higher kappa) support taller and broader structures. A population-level analysis of 1174 pulsars shows a clear positive correlation between soliton width and spin period, with millisecond pulsars hosting the narrowest solitons. By linking soliton dynamics to measurable pulsar parameters, this work provides a framework for interpreting magnetospheric microphysics and its role in shaping pulsar emission signatures.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the Compact Stellarator with Simple Coils at finite-beta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimized stellarator at finite plasma beta is realized by single-stage optimization of simply modifying the coil currents of the Compact Stellarator with Simple Coils (CSSC)[Yu et al., J. Plasma Physics 88,905880306 (2022)]. The CSSC is an optimized stellarator obtained by direct optimization via coil shapes, with its coil topology similar to that of the Columbia Non-neutral Torus (CNT) [Pederson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 205002 (2002)]. Due to its vacuum-based optimization, the CSSC exhibits detrimental finite beta effects on neoclassical confinement. The results of optimization show that the finite beta effects can be largely mitigated by reducing the coil currents of CSSC.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of a Fast-Sweeping Langmuir Probe Diagnostic for DC Arc Jet Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Langmuir probe diagnostics are a cornerstone of plasma characterization, providing critical measurements of electron temperature, electron density, and plasma potential. However, conventional swept Langmuir probes and other traditional electrostatic probes often lack the temporal resolution necessary to capture transient plasma behavior in dynamic environments. This paper presents the design and implementation of a fast-sweeping Langmuir probe system that is open-source, low-cost, and adaptable for a wide range of plasma applications. The probe system incorporates voltage sweeping to resolve rapid fluctuations in plasma parameters at a temporal resolution of up to 200 kHz. To validate its performance, the system was implemented in the 30 kW miniature Arc jet Research Chamber (mARC II), a high-enthalpy DC arc jet facility designed for prototype testing and development. Experimental results demonstrate the probe's capability to operate in extreme aerothermal conditions, providing time-resolved electron temperature and density along the flow's radial profile. This work establishes a robust and accessible Langmuir diagnostic solution for researchers studying transient plasma behavior in high-enthalpy environments.</description>

      <title>High-order Mie resonance and transient field enhancement in laser-driven plasma nanoshells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate substantial field enhancement in plasma nanoshells through high-order Mie resonances using combined Mie theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Optimal shell geometries yield approximately threefold electric field enhancement for 800 nm irradiation, with transient buildup times of tens of femtoseconds before plasma expansion disrupts resonance. Few-cycle pulses produce reduced enhancement due to insufficient resonance establishment. These findings enable optimized laser-plasma interactions for applications including diagnostics of laser-cluster interaction and energetic ion production from engineered core-shell targets, highlighting the critical role of temporal dynamics in nanoplasma resonances.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Model for Electron Heat Flux and Self-generated Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling of electron heat conduction and magnetic field takes significant effects in inertial confinement fusion (ICF). As the nonlocal models for electron heat conduction have been developed for modeling kinetic effects on heat flux in hydrodynamic scale, modeling kinetic effects on magnetic field are still restricted to flux limiters instead of nonlocal corrections. We propose a new nonlocal model which can recover the kinetic effects for heat conduction and magnetic field in hydrodynamic scale simultaneously. We clarify the necessity of self-consistently considering the electric field corrections in nonlocal models to get reasonable physical quantities. Using the new nonlocal model, the nonlocal corrections of transport coefficients in magnetized plasma and the magnetic field generation without density gradients are systematically studied. We find nonlocal effects significantly change the magnetic field distribution in laser ablation, which potentially influences the hydrodynamic instabilities in ICF.</description>

      <title>Spectral Deconvolution without the Deconvolution: Extracting Temperature from X-ray Thomson Scattering Spectra without the Source-and-Instrument Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) probes the dynamic structure factor of the system, but the measured spectrum is broadened by the combined source-and-instrument function (SIF) of the setup. In order to extract properties such as temperature from an XRTS spectrum, the broadening by the SIF needs to be removed. Recent work [Dornheim et al. Nature Commun. 13, 7911 (2022)] has suggested that the SIF may be deconvolved using the two-sided Laplace transform. However, the extracted information can depend strongly on the shape of the input SIF, and the SIF is in practice challenging to measure accurately. Here, we propose an alternative approach: we demonstrate that considering ratios of Laplace-transformed XRTS spectra collected at different scattering angles is equivalent to performing the deconvolution, but without the need for explicit knowledge of the SIF. From these ratios, it is possible to directly extract the temperature from the scattering spectra, when the system is in thermal equilibrium. We find the method to be generally robust to spectral noise and physical differences between the spectrometers, and we explore situations in which the method breaks down. Furthermore, the fact that consistent temperatures can be extracted for systems in thermal equilibrium indicates that non-equilibrium effects could be identified by inconsistent temperatures of a few eV between the ratios of three or more scattering angles.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Simulations of Weakly Collisional Plasmas with Braginskii Viscosity in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of an anisotropic viscosity solver within the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) framework of the TreeSPH code OpenGadget3. The solver models anisotropic viscous transport along magnetic field lines following the Braginskii formulation and includes physically motivated limiters based on the mirror and firehose instability thresholds, which constrain the viscous stress in weakly collisional plasmas. To validate the implementation, we performed a suite of standard test problems -- including two variants of the sound-wave test, circularly and linearly polarized Alfven waves, fast magnetosonic wave, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability -- both with and without the plasma-instability limiters. The results show excellent agreement with the AREPO implementation of a similar anisotropic viscosity model (Berlok et al. 2019), confirming the accuracy and robustness of our method. Our formulation integrates seamlessly within the individual adaptive timestepping framework of OpenGadget3, avoiding the need for subcycling. This provides efficient and stable time integration while maintaining physical consistency. Finally, we applied the new solver to a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy cluster, demonstrating its capability to model anisotropic transport and plasma microphysics in realistic large-scale environments. Our implementation offers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying anisotropic viscosity in magnetized astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Water activation using $\rm{Ar-H_2}$ atmospheric pressure plasma jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether for materials processing or medical applications, the use of atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) has emerged as a relevant alternative to conventional methods. Within the APPJs research field, the search for innovation aims not only to solve existing problems but also to explore novel options for generating plasma jets and find new possible applications. In this work, the properties of $\rm{Ar-H_2}$ APPJs generated using two plasma sources that differ in the frequency, amplitude, and waveform of the generated voltage signal were studied through electrical, thermal, and optical characterization. The discharge parameters were analyzed as a function of the $\rm{H_2}$ content in the gas mixture, with this parameter varying from 0\% to 3.5\%. Optical emission spectroscopy revealed that the same reactive species were produced for both plasma sources, except nitric oxide ($\rm{NO}$), which was observed only for the source operated at a higher frequency (PS \#1). Applications for water activation were performed without $\rm{H_2}$ and with 3.5\% $\rm{H_2}$ in the gas mixture. The results of water treatment revealed that ammonia is also produced when $\rm{H_2}$ is added to the working gas. This finding suggests that the water treated by a $\rm{Ar-H_2}$ plasma jet can be an attractive option for use in agriculture.</description>

      <title>Comparison of high-order moment models for the ion dynamics in a bounded low-temperature plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasmas often present non-equilibrium ion distribution functions due to the collisions with the background gas and the presence of strong electric fields. This non-equilibrium is beyond classical fluid models, often requiring computationally-intensive kinetic simulations. In our work, we study high-order moment models in order to capture the non-equilibrium state with a macroscopic set of equations, which is more computationally efficient than kinetic simulations. We compare numerical simulations of different moment closures: Grad's closure, the hyperbolic quadrature method of moments (HyQMOM), the extended quadrature method of moments, and a method based on entropy maximization. We assess the different closures for plasma applications and propose efficient numerical discretizations. The numerical solution of the high-order moment models is compared to kinetic simulations of an argon plasma between two floating walls at different pressure regimes, from nearly collisionless to collisionally-dominated. In general, all the high-order moment closures capture the ion transport with high fidelity as compared to the kinetic simulations, providing an improvement as compared to classical fluid models. Classical fluid closures such as the Fourier law for the heat flux is shown to be not suitable to capture the sheath or the low pressure regime. In addition, the ability of each moment method to reconstruct the velocity distribution function from the moments is assessed. The high-order moment models are able to capture the non-equilibrium distributions in the bulk and sheath with remarkable fidelity, dramatically improving classical fluid models while having comparable computational cost. In particular, the HyQMOM shows to be a robust method that provides an excellent comparison with the kinetic simulations of both the moments and the distribution function in the bulk and the sheath.</description>

      <title>Field enhancement of intense laser pulses in a subwavelength plasma aperture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of intense, ultra-short laser pulses with nanostructures offers promising avenues for spatiotemporal light control. While enhanced optical transmission through subwavelength apertures has been extensively studied in the linear regime, its extension to ultrashort, high-intensity pulses remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate, through three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, significant field enhancement of intense laser pulses in subwavelength plasma apertures. The enhancement exhibits a non-resonant character, remaining robust across a wide range of plasma densities and saturating above approximately $20n_c$, while showing minimal dependence on wall thickness. Analysis of the Poynting vector reveals that energy concentration arises from interference between the incident field and back-scattered longitudinal field components. This size-dependent enhanced transmission in plasma apertures enables potential applications such as plasma-based dichroic filters operating at extreme intensities.</description>

      <title>Planar Collisionless Shock Simulations with Semi-Implicit Particle-in-Cell Model FLEKS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the applicability of the semi-implicit particle-in-cell code FLEKS to heliospheric shock simulations. We examine one- and two-dimensional local planar shock simulations, initialized using MHD states with upstream conditions representative of plasmas in the hypersonic, $\beta\sim 1$ regime, for both quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel configurations. The refined algorithm in FLEKS proves robust, enabling accurate shock simulations with a grid resolution on the order of the electron inertial length $d_e$. Our simulations successfully capture key shock features, including shock structures (foot, ramp, overshoot, and undershoot), upstream and downstream waves (fast magnetosonic, whistler, Alfv\'en ion-cyclotron, and mirror modes), and non-Maxwellian particle distributions. Crucially, we find that at least two spatial dimensions are critical for accurately reproducing downstream wave physics in quasi-perpendicular shocks and capturing the complex dynamics of quasi-parallel shocks, including surface rippling, shocklets, SLAMS, magnetic reconnection and jets. Furthermore, our parameter studies demonstrate the impact of mass ratio and grid resolution on shock physics. This work provides valuable guidance for selecting appropriate physical and numerical parameters for shock simulations using a semi-implicit PIC method, paving the way for incorporating kinetic shock processes into large-scale collisionless plasma simulations with the MHD-AEPIC model.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Heavy Ions at Non-Relativistic Collisionless Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the process of Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) of particles with mass number to charge number ratios $A/Q &gt; 1$, e.g., partially-ionized heavy ions. To this end, we introduce helium- and carbon-like ions at solar abundances into two-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations of non-relativistic collisionless shocks. This study yields three main results: 1) Heavy ions are preferentially accelerated compared to hydrogen. For typical solar abundances, the energy transferred to accelerated helium ions is comparable to, or even exceeds, that of hydrogen, thereby enhancing the overall shock acceleration efficiency. 2) Accelerated helium ions contribute to magnetic field amplification, which increases the maximum attainable particle energy and steepen the spectra of accelerated particles. 3) The efficient acceleration of helium significantly enhances the production of hadronic gamma rays and neutrinos, likely dominating the one due to hydrogen. These effects should be taken into account, especially when modeling strong space and astrophysical shocks.</description>
