      <title>A going-down principle for {\'e}tale groupoids and the Baum-Connes conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a going-down principle for {\'e}tale groupoids and its applications, extending the earlier results for locally compact groups by Chabert, Echterhoff and Oyono-Oyono, and for ample groupoids by B{\"o}nicke and by B{\"o}nicke-Dell'Aiera. The proof in the general {\'e}tale groupoid setting is based on a more detailed study of groupoid simplicial complexes. We also study a bicategorical functoriality involving the induction functors from {\'e}tale groupoid correspondences, which was introduced by Miller. This yields a bicategorical interpretation of the induction-restriction adjunction. As an application of the going-down principle, we provide a proof of the split injectivity of Baum-Connes assembly map for {\'e}tale groupoids that are strongly amenable at infinity, recovering a result obtained by B{\"o}nicke and Proietti via a categorical approach. The going-down principle is also applied on the proof of continuity of topological K-theory of {\'e}tale groupoids and the study of scope of validity of K{\"u}nneth formulas.</description>

      <title>Ganea decompositions of classifying spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study homotopy decompositions of the classifying spaces $BG$ of compact connected Lie groups obtained by (relative) fiber-cofiber construction. Given a pair of Borel fibrations $ F \to E \to BG $ and $F' \to E' \to BG $, this construction yields a tower (telescope) of spaces $ X_{m}(F,F') $ over $BG$ indexed by $ \mathbb{Z}_+ $ that converges in the sense that $\text{hocolim} \,(X_{m})\,$ is weakly homotopy equivalent to $BG$. We determine cohomological conditions on the fibrations that produce the spaces $X_{m}(F,F')$ with properties similar to those of the spaces of quasi-invariants of Weyl groups constructed by the first and third authors. We prove that, under these conditions, the resulting homotopy decompositions of $BG$ are sharp (over $\mathbb{Q}$), the spaces $X_{m}(F,F')$ are rationally formal and Cohen-Macaulay, their cohomology rings being finite rank free modules over $H^*(BG, \mathbb{Q})$. We construct many examples which include the fundamental (maximal torus) fibration $ G/T \to BT \to BG $ as well as the universal fibration $\, E_{\rm com}G_{\bf 1} \to B_{\rm com}G_{\bf 1} \to BG \,$ for the classifying space $B_{\rm com}G$ of commuting elements in $G$ introduced by Adem and G\'{o}mez, as the first fibration in the pair. In most cases, we give an explicit presentation for the (equivariant) cohomology rings in terms of characteristic classes and compute the (equivariant) $K$-theory of the spaces involved. The paper contains an Appendix, where we re-examine the topological fiber-cofiber construction in an abstract setting, proving an $\infty$-categorical extension of the classical Ganea Theorem.</description>

      <title>Localizing invariants of constructible sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an open-closed decomposition of the stratifying poset, we construct a new semi-orthogonal decomposition of the $\infty$-category of constructible sheaves on a stratified space admitting an exit-path $\infty$-category. From this we obtain a direct sum decomposition of the localizing invariants of the $\infty$-category of constructible sheaves. Since the $\ast$-pullback to the open stratum in the usual (recollement) semi-orthogonal decomposition is not strongly left adjoint, this splitting does not follow from pure sheaf theory considerations. Instead, the splitting crucially relies on the exodromy equivalence: it implies that on the level of constructible sheaves, the $\ast$-pullback to a closed stratum and the $!$-pushforward from an open stratum admit left adjoints. These new functors provide an additional semi-orthogonal decomposition (with the roles of open and closed reversed) in which the relevant functors are strongly left adjoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field, let $A$ be a finite-dimensional semisimple $K$-algebra, and let $\Lambda$ be an $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-order in $A$. We give practical algorithms that determine whether $\Lambda$ has stably free cancellation (SFC). As an application, we determine all finite groups $G$ of order at most $383$ such that the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ has SFC.</description>

      <title>Conformal transformations and equivariance in unbounded KK-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend unbounded Kasparov theory to encompass conformal group and quantum group equivariance. This new framework allows us to treat conformal actions on both manifolds and noncommutative spaces. As examples, we present unbounded representatives of Kasparov's $\gamma$-element for the real and complex Lorentz groups and display the conformal $SL_q(2)$-equivariance of the standard spectral triple of the Podle\'s sphere. In pursuing descent for conformally equivariant cycles, we are led to a new framework for representing Kasparov classes. Our new representatives are unbounded, possess a dynamical quality, and also include known twisted spectral triples. We define an equivalence relation on these new representatives whose classes form an abelian group surjecting onto KK. The technical innovation which underpins these results is a novel multiplicative perturbation theory. By these means, we obtain Kasparov classes from the bounded transform with minimal side conditions.</description>

      <title>Homology and cohomology of crossed products by inverse monoid actions and Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a unital action $\theta $ of an inverse monoid $S$ on an algebra $A$ over a filed $K$ we produce (co)homology spectral sequences which converge to the Hochschild (co)homology of the crossed product $A\rtimes_\theta S$ with values in a bimodule over $A\rtimes_\theta S$. The spectral sequences involve a new kind of (co)homology of the inverse monoid $S,$ which is based on $KS$-modules. The spectral sequences take especially nice form, when $(A\rtimes_\theta S)^e $ is flat as a left (homology case) or right (cohomology case) $A^e$-module, involving also the Hochschild (co)homology of $A.$ Same nice spectral sequences are also obtained if $K$ is a commutative ring, over which $A$ is projective, and $S$ is $E$-unitary. We apply our results to the Steinberg algebra $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ over a field $K$ of an ample groupoid $\mathscr{G},$ whose unit space $\mathscr{G} ^{(0)}$ is compact. In the homology case our spectral sequence collapses on the $p$-axis, resulting in an isomorphism between the Hochschild homology of $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ with values in an $A_K(\mathscr{G})$-bimodule $M$ and the homology of the inverse semigroup of the compact open bisections of $\mathscr{G}$ with values in the invariant submodule of $M.$</description>

      <title>On the algebraic $K$-theory of smooth schemes over truncated Witt vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algebraic $K$-theory of smooth schemes over $W_n(\Bbbk)$, where $\Bbbk$ is a perfect field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. For a $p$-adic smooth scheme $X_{\centerdot}$ over $W_{\centerdot}(k)$, we introduce complexes $p^{r,m}_{r,n}\Omega^{\bullet}_{X_{\centerdot}}$ and infinitesimal motivic complexes $\mathbb{Z}_{X_n}(r)$, and for $0 \leq i \leq p-4$, we establish a Chern character isomorphism between the sheaf $\mathcal{K}_{X_n,X_{m},i}$ and the direct sum of certain cohomology sheaves of $p^{r,m}_{r,n}\Omega^{\bullet}_{X_{\centerdot}}$ with $1\leq r\leq i$. This leads to a criterion for $K$-theoretic infinitesimal deformations, which is related to Emerton's $p$-adic variational Hodge conjecture. By taking the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$ with $m=1$, we recover a theorem of Bloch, Esnault, and Kerz on continuous relative algebraic $K$-theory.
  The proof combines Brun's isomorphism relating $K$-theory to derived cyclic homology, computations of relative cyclic homology over $W(\Bbbk)$, and an analysis of multiplicative structures of the mod $p$ relative $K$-theory.</description>
