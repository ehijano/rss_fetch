      <title>Multilevel Picard approximations overcome the curse of dimensionality when approximating semilinear heat equations with gradient-dependent nonlinearities in $L^p$-sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that multilevel Picard approximations are capable of approximating solutions of semilinear heat equations in $L^{p}$-sense, ${p}\in [2,\infty)$, in the case of gradient-dependent, Lipschitz-continuous nonlinearities, while the computational effort of the multilevel Picard approximations grow at most polynomially in both dimension $d$ and prescribed reciprocal accuracy $\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Transient subtraction: A control variate method for computing transport coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics, transport coefficients measure the sensitivity of the invariant probability measure of the stochastic dynamics at hand with respect to some perturbation. They are typically computed using either the linear response of nonequilibrium dynamics, or the Green--Kubo formula. The estimators for both approaches have large variances, which motivates the study of variance reduction techniques for computing transport coefficients. We present an alternative approach, called the \emph{transient subtraction technique} (inspired by early work by Ciccotti and Jaccucci in 1975), which amounts to simulating a transient dynamics, from which we subtract a sensibly coupled equilibrium trajectory, resulting in an estimator with smaller variance. We present the mathematical formulation of the transient subtraction technique, give error estimates on the bias and variance of the associated estimator, and demonstrate the relevance of the method through numerical illustrations for various systems.</description>

      <title>Split Bregman Isotropic and Anisotropic Image Deblurring with Kronecker Product Sum Approximations using Single Precision Enlarged-GKB or RSVD Algorithms to provide low rank truncated SVDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the solution of the $\ell_1$ regularized image deblurring problem using isotropic and anisotropic regularization implemented with the split Bregman algorithm. For large scale problems, we replace the system matrix $A$ using a Kronecker product approximation obtained via an approximate truncated singular value decomposition for the reordered matrix $\mathcal{R}(A)$. To obtain the approximate decomposition for $\mathcal{R}(A)$ we propose the enlarged Golub Kahan Bidiagonalization algorithm that proceeds by enlarging the Krylov subspace beyond either a given rank for the desired approximation, or uses an automatic stopping test that provides a suitable rank for the approximation. The resultant expansion is contrasted with the use of the truncated and the randomized singular value decompositions with the same number of terms. To further extend the scale of problem that can be considered we implement the determination of the approximation using single precision, while performing all steps for the regularization in standard double precision. The reported numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of applying the approximate single precision Kronecker product expansion for $A$, combined with either isotropic or anisotropic regularization implemented using the split Bregman algorithm, for the solution of image deblurring problems. As the size of the problem increases, our results demonstrate that the major costs are associated with determining the Kronecker product approximation, rather than with the cost of the regularization algorithm. Moreover, the enlarged Golub Kahan Bidiagonalization algorithm competes favorably with the randomized singular value decomposition for estimating the approximate singular value decomposition.</description>

      <title>Neural network approaches for variance reduction in fluctuation formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method utilizing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve Poisson equations that serve as control variates in the computation of transport coefficients via fluctuation formulas, such as the Green--Kubo and generalized Einstein-like formulas. By leveraging approximate solutions to the Poisson equation constructed through neural networks, our approach significantly reduces the variance of the estimator at hand. We provide an extensive numerical analysis of the estimators and detail a methodology for training neural networks to solve these Poisson equations. The approximate solutions are then incorporated into Monte Carlo simulations as effective control variates, demonstrating the suitability of the method for moderately high-dimensional problems where fully deterministic solutions are computationally infeasible.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Considerations for Effective Global Search of Robust Low-Thrust Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in the cislunar domain over the past decade has led to an increasing demand for low-thrust missions to key orbits within this region. These low-thrust missions, typically characterized by long thrust arcs, are highly susceptible to operational disruptions such as unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficient trajectory design frameworks which incorporate robustness against such anomalies. In this study, we utilize a robust trajectory design framework to explore the solution space for the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module to the Earth-Moon L2 Southern 9:2 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We propose algorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and present a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach which involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional approach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the non-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions as initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of the final solutions.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving implicit exponential time differencing scheme for Maxwell-Amp`ere Nernst-Planck model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of charged particles, which can be described by the Maxwell-Ampere Nernst-Planck (MANP) framework, is essential in various applications including ion channels and semiconductors. We propose a decoupled structure-preserving numerical scheme for the MANP model in this work. The Nernst-Planck equations are treated by the implicit exponential time differencing method associated with the Slotboom transform to preserve the positivity of the concentrations. In order to be effective with the Fast Fourier Transform, additional diffusive terms are introduced into Nernst-Planck equations. Meanwhile, the correction is introduced in the Maxwell-Ampere equation to fulfill Gauss's law. The curl-free condition for electric displacement is realized by a local curl-free relaxation algorithm whose complexity is O(N). We present sufficient restrictions on the time and spatial steps to satisfy the positivity and energy dissipation law at a discrete level. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the expected numerical accuracy and demonstrate the structure-preserving properties of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving parametric finite element method for solid-state dewetting on curved substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional sharp-interface model for solid-state dewetting of thin films with anisotropic surface energies on curved substrates, where the film/vapor interface and substrate surface are represented by an evolving and a static curve, respectively. The model is governed by the anisotropic surface diffusion for the evolving curve, with appropriate boundary conditions at the contact points where the two curves meet. The continuum model obeys an energy decay law and preserves the enclosed area between the two curves. We introduce an arclength parameterization for the substrate curve, which plays a crucial role in a structure-preserving approximation as it straightens the curved substrate and tracks length changes between contact points. Based on this insight, we introduce a symmetrized weak formulation which leads to an unconditional energy stable parametric approximation in terms of the discrete energy. We also provide an error estimate of the enclosed area, which depends on the substrate profile and can be zero in the case of a flat substrate. Furthermore, we introduce a correction to the discrete normals to enable an exact area preservation for general curved substrates. The resulting nonlinear system is efficiently solved using a hybrid iterative algorithm which combines both Picard and Newton's methods. Numerical results are presented to show the robustness and good properties of the introduced method for simulating solid-state dewetting on various curved substrates.</description>

      <title>Order Reduction of Exponential Runge--Kutta Methods: Non-Commuting Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear parabolic equations are central to numerous applications in science and engineering, posing significant challenges for analytical solutions and necessitating efficient numerical methods. Exponential integrators have recently gained attention for handling stiff differential equations. This paper explores exponential Runge--Kutta methods for solving such equations, focusing on the simplified form $u^{\prime}(t)+A u(t)=B u(t)$, where $A$ generates an analytic semigroup and $B$ is relatively bounded with respect to $A$. By treating $A$ exactly and $B$ explicitly, we derive error bounds for exponential Runge--Kutta methods up to third order. Our analysis shows that these methods maintain their order under mild regularity conditions on the initial data $u_0$, while also addressing the phenomenon of order reduction in higher-order methods. Through a careful convergence analysis and numerical investigations, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the applicability and limitations of exponential Runge--Kutta methods in solving linear parabolic equations involving two unbounded and non-commuting operators.</description>

      <title>Exponential Runge-Kutta methods for delay equations in the sun-star abstract framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponential Runge-Kutta methods for semilinear ordinary differential equations can be extended to abstract differential equations, defined on Banach spaces. Thanks to the sun-star theory, both delay differential equations and renewal equations can be recast as abstract differential equations, which motivates the present work. The result is a general approach that allows us to define the methods explicitly and analyze their convergence properties in a unifying way.</description>

      <title>Improving sampling by modifying the effective diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a preliminary version. Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers based on discretizations of (overdamped) Langevin dynamics are commonly used in the Bayesian inference and computational statistical physics literature to estimate high-dimensional integrals. One can introduce a non-constant diffusion matrix to precondition these dynamics, and recent works have optimize it in order to sooner reach stationarity by overcoming entropic and energy barriers. However, the methodology introduced to compute these optimal diffusions is not suited to high-dimensional settings, as it relies on costly optimization procedures. In this work, we propose a class of diffusion matrices, based on one-dimensional collective variables (CVs), which helps dynamics explore the latent space defined by the CV. The form of the diffusion matrix is such that the effective dynamics, which are approximations of the processes as observed on the latent space, are governed by the optimal effective diffusion coefficient in a homogenized limit, which possesses an analytical expression. We describe how this class of diffusion matrices can be constructed and learned during the simulation. We provide implementations of the Metropolis--Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Riemman Manifold (Generalized) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, and discuss numerical optimizations in the case when the CV depends only on a few number of components of the position of the system. We illustrate the efficiency gains of using this class of diffusion by computing mean transition durations between two configurations of a dimer in a solvent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an interpolatory high-order cubature rule to compute integrals of smooth functions over self-affine sets with respect to an invariant measure. The main difficulty is the computation of the cubature weights, which we characterize algebraically, by exploiting a self-similarity property of the integral. We propose an $h$-version and a $p$-version of the cubature, present an error analysis and conduct numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Warped geometries of Segre-Veronese manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segre-Veronese manifolds are smooth manifolds consisting of partially symmetric rank-$1$ tensors. They are naturally viewed as submanifolds of a Euclidean space of tensors. However, they can also be equipped with other metrics than their induced metrics, such as warped product metrics. We investigate a one-parameter family of warped geometries, which includes the standard Euclidean geometry, and whose parameter controls by how much spherical tangent directions are weighted relative to radial tangent directions. We compute the exponential and logarithmic maps of these warped Segre-Veronese manifolds, including the corresponding starting and connecting geodesics. A closed formula for the intrinsic distance between points on the warped Segre-Veronese manifold is presented. We determine for which warping parameters Segre-Veronese manifolds are geodesically connected and show that they are not geodesically connected in the standard Euclidean geometry. The benefits of connecting geodesics may outweigh using the Euclidean geometry in certain applications. One such application is presented: numerically computing the Riemannian center of mass for averaging rank-$1$ tensors.</description>

      <title>On high-order/low-order and micro-macro methods for implicit time-stepping of the BGK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a high-order/low-order (HOLO) method is combined with a micro-macro (MM) decomposition to accelerate iterative solvers in fully implicit time-stepping of the BGK equation for gas dynamics. The MM formulation represents a kinetic distribution as the sum of a local Maxwellian and a perturbation. In highly collisional regimes, the perturbation away from initial and boundary layers is small and can be compressed to reduce the overall storage cost of the distribution. The convergence behavior of the MM methods, the usual HOLO method, and the standard source iteration method is analyzed on a linear BGK model. Both the HOLO and MM methods are implemented using a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization in phase space, which naturally preserves the consistency between high- and low-order models required by the HOLO approach. The accuracy and performance of these methods are compared on the Sod shock tube problem and a sudden wall heating boundary layer problem. Overall, the results demonstrate the robustness of the MM and HOLO approaches and illustrate the compression benefits enabled by the MM formulation when the kinetic distribution is near equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition on domains with curved boundaries. We consider the Raviart-Thomas element (RTk ) of degree $k \geq 1 $on triangular mesh. on a triangular mesh. A key feature of our boundary value correction method is the shift from the true boundary to a surrogate boundary. We present a high-order version of the method, achieving an $O(h^k+1/2)$ convergence in $L^2$-norm estimate for the velocity field and an $O(h^k )$ convergence in $H^1$-norm estimate for the pressure. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoresonance is a phenomenon of physical interest that may take place when a nonlinear oscillator is forced at a frequency that varies slowly. The stroboscopic averaging method (SAM), which provides an efficient numerical technique for the integration of highly oscillatory systems, cannot be used directly to study autoresonance due to the slow changes of the forcing frequency. We study how to modify SAM to cater for such slow variations. Numerical experiments show the computational advantages of using SAM.</description>

      <title>Solving High-Dimensional Partial Integral Differential Equations: The Finite Expression Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new finite expression method (FEX) to solve high-dimensional partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). This approach builds upon the original FEX and its inherent advantages with new advances: 1) A novel method of parameter grouping is proposed to reduce the number of coefficients in high-dimensional function approximation; 2) A Taylor series approximation method is implemented to significantly improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the evaluation of the integral terms of PIDEs. The new FEX based method, denoted FEX-PG to indicate the addition of the parameter grouping (PG) step to the algorithm, provides both high accuracy and interpretable numerical solutions, with the outcome being an explicit equation that facilitates intuitive understanding of the underlying solution structures. These features are often absent in traditional methods, such as finite element methods (FEM) and finite difference methods, as well as in deep learning-based approaches. To benchmark our method against recent advances, we apply the new FEX-PG to solve benchmark PIDEs in the literature. In high-dimensional settings, FEX-PG exhibits strong and robust performance, achieving relative errors on the order of single precision machine epsilon.</description>

      <title>Hybridized Projected Differential Transform Method For collisional-breakage equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-linear collision induced fragmentation plays a crucial role in modeling several engineering and physical problems. In contrast to linear breakage, it has not been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. This study introduces an innovative method that leverages the Elzaki integral transform as a preparatory step to enhance the accuracy and convergence of domain decomposition, used alongside the projected differential transform method to obtain closed-form or series approximations of solutions for the collisional breakage equation (CBE). A significant advantages of this technique is its capability to directly address both linear and nonlinear differential equations without the need for discretization or linearization. The mathematical framework is reinforced by a thorough convergence analysis, applying fixed point theory within an adequately defined Banach space. Additionally, error estimates for the approximated solutions are derived, offering more profound insights into the accuracy and dependability of the proposed method. The validity of this approach is demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with exact or finite volume approximated solutions considering several physical examples. Interestingly, the proposed algorithm yields accurate approximations for the number density functions as well as moments with fewer terms and maintains higher precision over extended time periods.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning for Accelerated Gradient Descent Optimization and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerated training algorithms, such as adaptive learning rates and various normalization methods, are widely used but not fully understood. When regularization is introduced, standard optimizers like adaptive learning rates may not perform effectively. This raises the need for alternative regularization approaches and the question of how to properly combine regularization with preconditioning. In this paper, we address these challenges using the theory of preconditioning as follows: (1) We explain how preconditioning with AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam accelerates training; (2) We explore the interaction between regularization and preconditioning, outlining different options for selecting the variables for regularization, and in particular we discuss how to implement that for the gradient regularization; and (3) We demonstrate how normalization methods accelerate training by improving Hessian conditioning, and discuss how this perspective can lead to new preconditioning training algorithms. Our findings offer a unified mathematical framework for understanding various acceleration techniques and deriving appropriate regularization schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding eigenvalue distributions for a number of sparse random matrix ensembles can be reduced to solving nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. While a systematic mathematical theory of such equations exists, it has not been previously applied to sparse matrix problems. We close this gap in the literature by showing how one can employ numerical solutions of Hammerstein equations to accurately recover the spectra of adjacency matrices and Laplacians of random graphs. While our treatment focuses on random graphs for concreteness, the methodology has broad applications to more general sparse random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for simulation of incompressible viscous flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering method in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Numerical simulations are carried out for both laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Geometric shape matching for recovering protein conformations from single-particle Cryo-EM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address recovery of the three-dimensional backbone structure of single polypeptide proteins from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-SPA) data. Cryo-SPA produces noisy tomographic projections of electrostatic potentials of macromolecules. From these projections, we use methods from shape analysis to recover the three-dimensional backbone structure. Thus, we view the reconstruction problem as an indirect matching problem, where a point cloud representation of the protein backbone is deformed to match 2D tomography data. The deformations are obtained via the action of a matrix Lie group. By selecting a deformation energy, the optimality conditions are obtained, which lead to computational algorithms for optimal deformations. We showcase our approach on synthetic data, for which we recover the three-dimensional structure of the backbone.</description>

      <title>Empirical Perturbation Analysis of Linear System Solvers from a Data Poisoning Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perturbation analysis of linear solvers applied to systems arising broadly in machine learning settings -- for instance, when using linear regression models -- establishes an important perspective when reframing these analyses through the lens of a data poisoning attack. By analyzing solvers' responses to such attacks, this work aims to contribute to the development of more robust linear solvers and provide insights into poisoning attacks on linear solvers. In particular, we investigate how the errors in the input data will affect the fitting error and accuracy of the solution from a linear system-solving algorithm under perturbations common in adversarial attacks. We propose data perturbation through two distinct knowledge levels, developing a poisoning optimization and studying two methods of perturbation: Label-guided Perturbation (LP) and Unconditioning Perturbation (UP). Existing works mainly focus on deriving the worst-case perturbation bound from a theoretical perspective, and the analysis is often limited to specific kinds of linear system solvers. Under the circumstance that the data is intentionally perturbed -- as is the case with data poisoning -- we seek to understand how different kinds of solvers react to these perturbations, identifying those algorithms most impacted by different types of adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Dropout Ensemble Kalman inversion for high dimensional inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) is an ensemble-based method to solve inverse problems. Its gradient-free formulation makes it an attractive tool for problems with involved formulation. However, EKI suffers from the ''subspace property'', i.e., the EKI solutions are confined in the subspace spanned by the initial ensemble. It implies that the ensemble size should be larger than the problem dimension to ensure EKI's convergence to the correct solution. Such scaling of ensemble size is impractical and prevents the use of EKI in high dimensional problems. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach using dropout regularization to mitigate the subspace problem. We prove that dropout-EKI converges in the small ensemble settings, and the computational cost of the algorithm scales linearly with dimension. We also show that dropout-EKI reaches the optimal query complexity, up to a constant factor. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Reducing polynomial degree by one for inner-stage operators affects neither stability type nor accuracy order of the Runge--Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Runge--Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is a mainstream numerical algorithm for solving hyperbolic equations. In this paper, we use the linear advection equation in one and two dimensions as a model problem to prove the following results: For an arbitrarily high-order RKDG scheme in Butcher form, as long as we use the $P^k$ approximation in the final stage, even if we drop the $k$th-order polynomial modes and use the $P^{k-1}$ approximation for the DG operators at all inner RK stages, the resulting numerical method still maintains the same type of stability and convergence rate as those of the original RKDG method. Numerical examples are provided to validate the analysis. The numerical method analyzed in this paper is a special case of the Class A RKDG method with stage-dependent polynomial spaces proposed in arXiv:2402.15150. Our analysis provides theoretical justifications for employing cost-effective and low-order spatial discretization at specific RK stages for developing more efficient DG schemes without affecting stability and accuracy of the original method.</description>

      <title>An AI-aided algorithm for multivariate polynomial reconstruction on Cartesian grids and the PLG finite difference method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polynomial reconstruction on Cartesian grids is fundamental in many scientific and engineering applications, yet it is still an open problem how to construct for a finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{Z}^{\textsf{D}}$ a lattice $\mathcal{T}\subset K$ so that multivariate polynomial interpolation on this lattice is unisolvent. In this work, we solve this open problem of poised lattice generation (PLG) via an interdisciplinary research of approximation theory, abstract algebra, and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, we focus on the triangular lattices in approximation theory, study group actions of permutations upon triangular lattices, prove an isomorphism between the group of permutations and that of triangular lattices, and dynamically organize the AI state space of permutations so that a depth-first search of poised lattices has optimal efficiency. Based on this algorithm, we further develop the PLG finite difference method that retains the simplicity of Cartesian grids yet overcomes the disadvantage of legacy finite difference methods in handling irregular geometries. Results of various numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and the simplicity, efficiency, and fourth-order accuracy of the PLG finite difference method.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fast simulation of dynamical systems is a key challenge in many scientific and engineering applications, such as weather forecasting, disease control, and drug discovery. With the recent success of deep learning, there is increasing interest in using neural networks to solve differential equations in a data-driven manner. However, existing methods are either limited to specific types of differential equations or require large amounts of data for training. This restricts their practicality in many real-world applications, where data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal foundation model, named \textbf{FMint} (\textbf{F}oundation \textbf{M}odel based on \textbf{In}i\textbf{t}ialization), to bridge the gap between human-designed and data-driven models for the fast simulation of dynamical systems. Built on a decoder-only transformer architecture with in-context learning, FMint utilizes both numerical and textual data to learn a universal error correction scheme for dynamical systems, using prompted sequences of coarse solutions from traditional solvers. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of 40K ODEs, and we perform extensive experiments on challenging ODEs that exhibit chaotic behavior and of high dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of both accuracy and efficiency compared to classical numerical solvers, highlighting FMint's potential as a general-purpose solver for dynamical systems. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms. The code for FMint is available at \url{https://github.com/margotyjx/FMint}.</description>

      <title>Volume-preserving geometric shape optimization of the Dirichlet energy using variational neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19064v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the numerical solution of geometric shape optimization problems using neural network-based approaches. This involves minimizing a numerical criterion that includes solving a partial differential equation with respect to a domain, often under geometric constraints like a constant volume. We successfully develop a proof of concept using a flexible and parallelizable methodology to tackle these problems. We focus on a prototypal problem: minimizing the so-called Dirichlet energy with respect to the domain under a volume constraint, involving Poisson's equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We use variational neural networks to approximate the solution to Poisson's equation on a given domain, and represent the shape through a neural network that approximates a volume-preserving transformation from an initial shape to an optimal one. These processes are combined in a single optimization algorithm that minimizes the Dirichlet energy. A significant advantage of this approach is its inherent parallelizability, which makes it easy to handle the addition of parameters. Additionally, it does not rely on shape derivative or adjoint calculations. Our approach is tested on Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions, parametric right-hand sides, and extended to Bernoulli-type free boundary problems. The source code for solving the shape optimization problem is open-source and freely available.</description>

      <title>Alternating Maximization Algorithm for Mismatch Capacity with Oblivious Relaying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An approach is established for maximizing the Lower bound on the Mismatch capacity (hereafter abbreviated as LM rate), a key performance bound in mismatched decoding, by optimizing the channel input probability distribution. Under a fixed channel input probability distribution, the computation of the corresponding LM rate is a convex optimization problem. When optimizing the channel input probability distribution, however, the corresponding optimization problem adopts a max-min formulation, which is generally non-convex and is intractable with standard approaches. To solve this problem, a novel dual form of the LM rate is proposed, thereby transforming the max-min formulation into an equivalent double maximization formulation. This new formulation leads to a maximization problem setup wherein each individual optimization direction is convex. Consequently, an alternating maximization algorithm is established to solve the resultant maximization problem setup. Each step of the algorithm only involves a closed-form iteration, which is efficiently implemented with standard optimization procedures. Numerical experiments show the proposed approach for optimizing the LM rate leads to noticeable rate gains.</description>

Abstract: Multiphase flows are an important class of fluid flow and their study facilitates the development of diverse applications in industrial, natural and biomedical systems. Simulating such flows requires significant computational resources, making it prudent to devise an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method to mitigate this burden. We use a mathematical model that takes a continuum mechanical approach to describe multiphase mixture flows. The resulting system of equations poses numerical challenges due to the presence of multiple non-linear terms and a co-incompressibility condition, while the resulting fluid dynamics necessitate the development of an adaptive mesh refinement technique to accurately capture regions of interest while keeping computational costs low. We present an accurate, robust, and efficient computational method for simulating multiphase mixtures on adaptive grids, and utilize a multigrid solver to precondition the saddle-point system. We demonstrate that the AMR solver asymptotically approaches second order accuracy in $L^1$, $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms for all solution variables of the Newtonian and non-Newtonian models. All experiments demonstrate the solver is stable provided the time step size satisfies the imposed CFL condition. The solver can accurately resolve sharp gradients in the solution and, with the multigrid preconditioner, the solver behavior is independent of grid spacing. Our AMR solver offers a major cost savings benefit, providing up to 10x speedup in the numerical experiments presented here, with greater speedup possible depending on the problem set-up.</description>
