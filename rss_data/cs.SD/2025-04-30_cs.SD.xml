      <title>Design, analysis, and experimental validation of a stepped plate parametric array loudspeaker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the design and analysis of a stepped plate parametric array loudspeaker (SPPAL) as an alternative to conventional array-based parametric loudspeakers. The SPPAL utilizes a single Langevin-type ultrasonic transducer coupled with a flexural stepped plate to generate narrow-beam audible sound via nonlinear acoustic interaction. To evaluate and optimize the performance of the SPPAL, an integrated modeling framework is developed, consisting of an approximate analytical 3D model for transducer dynamics, an equivalence ratio formulation to relate stepped plate and rigid piston behavior, and a spherical wave expansion method for nonlinear sound field simulation. The dual-resonance behavior of the transducer is optimized through multi-objective analysis to enhance low-frequency audio performance. Experimental validation includes frequency response and modal analysis of the transducer, as well as sound field measurements. The analytical methods are further verified through comparison with experimental data. Furthermore, combination resonance--an unintended structural excitation resulting from intermodulation--is identified as an inherent phenomenon in SPPAL operation. The findings offer practical guidance for the development of efficient, compact, and manufacturable parametric array loudspeakers employing plate-based flexural vibration.</description>

      <title>DGFNet: End-to-End Audio-Visual Source Separation Based on Dynamic Gating Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Audio-Visual Source Separation methods primarily adopt two design strategies. The first strategy involves fusing audio and visual features at the bottleneck layer of the encoder, followed by processing the fused features through the decoder. However, when there is a significant disparity between the two modalities, this approach may lead to the loss of critical information. The second strategy avoids direct fusion and instead relies on the decoder to handle the interaction between audio and visual features. Nonetheless, if the encoder fails to integrate information across modalities adequately, the decoder may be unable to effectively capture the complex relationships between them. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dynamic fusion method based on a gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the modality fusion degree. This approach mitigates the limitations of solely relying on the decoder and facilitates efficient collaboration between audio and visual features. Additionally, an audio attention module is introduced to enhance the expressive capacity of audio features, thereby further improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements on two benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness and advantages in Audio-Visual Source Separation tasks.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Room Acoustic Rendering with Multi-View Vision Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An immersive acoustic experience enabled by spatial audio is just as crucial as the visual aspect in creating realistic virtual environments. However, existing methods for room impulse response estimation rely either on data-demanding learning-based models or computationally expensive physics-based modeling. In this work, we introduce Audio-Visual Differentiable Room Acoustic Rendering (AV-DAR), a framework that leverages visual cues extracted from multi-view images and acoustic beam tracing for physics-based room acoustic rendering. Experiments across six real-world environments from two datasets demonstrate that our multimodal, physics-based approach is efficient, interpretable, and accurate, significantly outperforming a series of prior methods. Notably, on the Real Acoustic Field dataset, AV-DAR achieves comparable performance to models trained on 10 times more data while delivering relative gains ranging from 16.6% to 50.9% when trained at the same scale.</description>

      <title>Let Network Decide What to Learn: Symbolic Music Understanding Model Based on Large-scale Adversarial Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a crucial aspect of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), Symbolic Music Understanding (SMU) has garnered significant attention for its potential to assist both musicians and enthusiasts in learning and creating music. Recently, pre-trained language models have been widely adopted in SMU due to the substantial similarities between symbolic music and natural language, as well as the ability of these models to leverage limited music data effectively. However, some studies have shown the common pre-trained methods like Mask Language Model (MLM) may introduce bias issues like racism discrimination in Natural Language Process (NLP) and affects the performance of downstream tasks, which also happens in SMU. This bias often arises when masked tokens cannot be inferred from their context, forcing the model to overfit the training set instead of generalizing. To address this challenge, we propose Adversarial-MidiBERT for SMU, which adaptively determines what to mask during MLM via a masker network, rather than employing random masking. By avoiding the masking of tokens that are difficult to infer from context, our model is better equipped to capture contextual structures and relationships, rather than merely conforming to the training data distribution. We evaluate our method across four SMU tasks, and our approach demonstrates excellent performance in all cases. The code for our model is publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/Adversarial-MidiBERT .</description>

      <title>End-to-end Audio Deepfake Detection from RAW Waveforms: a RawNet-Based Approach with Cross-Dataset Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio deepfakes represent a growing threat to digital security and trust, leveraging advanced generative models to produce synthetic speech that closely mimics real human voices. Detecting such manipulations is especially challenging under open-world conditions, where spoofing methods encountered during testing may differ from those seen during training. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for audio deepfake detection that operates directly on raw waveforms. Our model, RawNetLite, is a lightweight convolutional-recurrent architecture designed to capture both spectral and temporal features without handcrafted preprocessing. To enhance robustness, we introduce a training strategy that combines data from multiple domains and adopts Focal Loss to emphasize difficult or ambiguous samples. We further demonstrate that incorporating codec-based manipulations and applying waveform-level audio augmentations (e.g., pitch shifting, noise, and time stretching) leads to significant generalization improvements under realistic acoustic conditions. The proposed model achieves over 99.7% F1 and 0.25% EER on in-domain data (FakeOrReal), and up to 83.4% F1 with 16.4% EER on a challenging out-of-distribution test set (AVSpoof2021 + CodecFake). These findings highlight the importance of diverse training data, tailored objective functions and audio augmentations in building resilient and generalizable audio forgery detectors. Code and pretrained models are available at https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/mfs/Deepfakes/PaperRawNet2025/.</description>

      <title>Addressing Emotion Bias in Music Emotion Recognition and Generation with Frechet Audio Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complex nature of musical emotion introduces inherent bias in both recognition and generation, particularly when relying on a single audio encoder, emotion classifier, or evaluation metric. In this work, we conduct a study on Music Emotion Recognition (MER) and Emotional Music Generation (EMG), employing diverse audio encoders alongside Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), a reference-free evaluation metric. Our study begins with a benchmark evaluation of MER, highlighting the limitations of using a single audio encoder and the disparities observed across different measurements. We then propose assessing MER performance using FAD derived from multiple encoders to provide a more objective measure of musical emotion. Furthermore, we introduce an enhanced EMG approach designed to improve both the variability and prominence of generated musical emotion, thereby enhancing its realism. Additionally, we investigate the differences in realism between the emotions conveyed in real and synthetic music, comparing our EMG model against two baseline models. Experimental results underscore the issue of emotion bias in both MER and EMG and demonstrate the potential of using FAD and diverse audio encoders to evaluate musical emotion more objectively and effectively.</description>

      <title>Revise, Reason, and Recognize: LLM-Based Emotion Recognition via Emotion-Specific Prompts and ASR Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Annotating and recognizing speech emotion using prompt engineering has recently emerged with the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its efficacy and reliability remain questionable. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on this topic, beginning with the proposal of novel prompts that incorporate emotion-specific knowledge from acoustics, linguistics, and psychology. Subsequently, we examine the effectiveness of LLM-based prompting on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription, contrasting it with ground-truth transcription. Furthermore, we propose a Revise-Reason-Recognize prompting pipeline for robust LLM-based emotion recognition from spoken language with ASR errors. Additionally, experiments on context-aware learning, in-context learning, and instruction tuning are performed to examine the usefulness of LLM training schemes in this direction. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs to minor prompt variations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the emotion-specific prompts, ASR error correction, and LLM training schemes for LLM-based emotion recognition. Our study aims to refine the use of LLMs in emotion recognition and related domains.</description>

      <title>Cross-Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition: Humans vs. Self-Supervised Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has proven effective, yet limited research has explored cross-lingual scenarios. This study presents a comparative analysis between human performance and SSL models, beginning with a layer-wise analysis and an exploration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies in monolingual, cross-lingual, and transfer learning contexts. We further compare the SER ability of models and humans at both utterance- and segment-levels. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dialect on cross-lingual SER through human evaluation. Our findings reveal that models, with appropriate knowledge transfer, can adapt to the target language and achieve performance comparable to native speakers. We also demonstrate the significant effect of dialect on SER for individuals without prior linguistic and paralinguistic background. Moreover, both humans and models exhibit distinct behaviors across different emotions. These results offer new insights into the cross-lingual SER capabilities of SSL models, underscoring both their similarities to and differences from human emotion perception.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Cognitive State Classification from Speech with Multi-View Pseudo-Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lack of labeled data is a common challenge in speech classification tasks, particularly those requiring extensive subjective assessment, such as cognitive state classification. In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling method that leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the most confident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeled data are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculated from embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, large language models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognition transcriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specific knowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both sources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodal classifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until a predefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotion recognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised learning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms two selected baselines.</description>

      <title>Exploring Acoustic Similarity in Emotional Speech and Music via Self-Supervised Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech and music shares similarities due to their acoustic overlap, which has led to interest in transferring knowledge between these domains. However, the shared acoustic cues between speech and music, particularly those encoded by Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models, remain largely unexplored, given the fact that SSL models for speech and music have rarely been applied in cross-domain research. In this work, we revisit the acoustic similarity between emotion speech and music, starting with an analysis of the layerwise behavior of SSL models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Music Emotion Recognition (MER). Furthermore, we perform cross-domain adaptation by comparing several approaches in a two-stage fine-tuning process, examining effective ways to utilize music for SER and speech for MER. Lastly, we explore the acoustic similarities between emotional speech and music using Frechet audio distance for individual emotions, uncovering the issue of emotion bias in both speech and music SSL models. Our findings reveal that while speech and music SSL models do capture shared acoustic features, their behaviors can vary depending on different emotions due to their training strategies and domain-specificities. Additionally, parameter-efficient fine-tuning can enhance SER and MER performance by leveraging knowledge from each other. This study provides new insights into the acoustic similarity between emotional speech and music, and highlights the potential for cross-domain generalization to improve SER and MER systems.</description>

      <title>Ditto: Motion-Space Diffusion for Controllable Realtime Talking Head Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have endowed talking head synthesis with subtle expressions and vivid head movements, but have also led to slow inference speed and insufficient control over generated results. To address these issues, we propose Ditto, a diffusion-based talking head framework that enables fine-grained controls and real-time inference. Specifically, we utilize an off-the-shelf motion extractor and devise a diffusion transformer to generate representations in a specific motion space. We optimize the model architecture and training strategy to address the issues in generating motion representations, including insufficient disentanglement between motion and identity, and large internal discrepancies within the representation. Besides, we employ diverse conditional signals while establishing a mapping between motion representation and facial semantics, enabling control over the generation process and correction of the results. Moreover, we jointly optimize the holistic framework to enable streaming processing, real-time inference, and low first-frame delay, offering functionalities crucial for interactive applications such as AI assistants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Ditto generates compelling talking head videos and exhibits superiority in both controllability and real-time performance.</description>

      <title>FleSpeech: Flexibly Controllable Speech Generation with Various Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controllable speech generation methods typically rely on single or fixed prompts, hindering creativity and flexibility. These limitations make it difficult to meet specific user needs in certain scenarios, such as adjusting the style while preserving a selected speaker's timbre, or choosing a style and generating a voice that matches a character's visual appearance. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textit{FleSpeech}, a novel multi-stage speech generation framework that allows for more flexible manipulation of speech attributes by integrating various forms of control. FleSpeech employs a multimodal prompt encoder that processes and unifies different text, audio, and visual prompts into a cohesive representation. This approach enhances the adaptability of speech synthesis and supports creative and precise control over the generated speech. Additionally, we develop a data collection pipeline for multimodal datasets to facilitate further research and applications in this field. Comprehensive subjective and objective experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FleSpeech. Audio samples are available at https://kkksuper.github.io/FleSpeech/</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Corrupted Prediction for Learning Robust Audio-Visual Speech Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) incorporates auditory and visual modalities to improve recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments where audio-only speech systems are insufficient. While previous research has largely addressed audio disruptions, few studies have dealt with visual corruptions, e.g., lip occlusions or blurred videos, which are also detrimental. To address this real-world challenge, we propose CAV2vec, a novel self-supervised speech representation learning framework particularly designed to handle audio-visual joint corruption. CAV2vec employs a self-distillation approach with a corrupted prediction task, where the student model learns to predict clean targets, generated by the teacher model, with corrupted input frames. Specifically, we suggest a unimodal multi-task learning, which distills cross-modal knowledge and aligns the corrupted modalities, by predicting clean audio targets with corrupted videos, and clean video targets with corrupted audios. This strategy mitigates the dispersion in the representation space caused by corrupted modalities, leading to more reliable and robust audio-visual fusion. Our experiments on robust AVSR benchmarks demonstrate that the corrupted representation learning method significantly enhances recognition accuracy across generalized environments involving various types of corruption. Our code is available at https://github.com/sungnyun/cav2vec.</description>
