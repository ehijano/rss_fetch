      <title>Optimal Risk-Sensitive Scheduling Policies for Remote Estimation of Autoregressive Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design scheduling policies that minimize a risk-sensitive cost criterion for a remote estimation setup. Since risk-sensitive cost objective takes into account not just the mean value of the cost, but also higher order moments of its probability distribution, the resulting policy is robust to changes in the underlying system's parameters. The setup consists of a sensor that observes a discrete-time autoregressive Markov process, and at each time $t$ decides whether or not to transmit its observations to a remote estimator using an unreliable wireless communication channel after encoding these observations into data packets. We model the communication channel as a Gilbert-Elliott channel \cite{10384144}. Sensor probes the channel \cite{laourine2010betting} and hence knows the channel state at each time $t$ before making scheduling decision. The scheduler has to minimize the expected value of the exponential of the finite horizon cumulative cost that is sum of the following two quantities (i) the cumulative transmission power consumed, (ii) the cumulative squared estimator error. We pose this dynamic optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the system state at time $t$ is composed of (i) the instantaneous error $\Delta(t):= x(t)-a\hat{x}(t-1)$, where $x(t),\hat{x}(t-1)$ are the system state and the estimate at time $t,t-1$ respectively, and (ii) the channel state $c(t)$. We show that there exists an optimal policy that has a threshold structure, i.e., at each time $t$, for each possible channel state $c$, there is a threshold $\D\ust(c)$ such that if the current channel state is $c$, then it transmits only when the error $\D(t)$ exceeds $\D\ust(c)$.</description>

      <title>High Accuracy Numerical Optimal Control for Rigid Bodies with Patch Contacts through Equivalent Contact Points -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the Finite Elements with Switch Detection and Jumps (FESD-J) [1] method to problems of rigid body dynamics involving patch contacts. The FESD-J method is a high accuracy discretization scheme suitable for use in direct optimal control of nonsmooth mechanical systems. It detects dynamic switches exactly in time and, thereby, maintains the integration order of the underlying Runge- Kutta (RK) method. This is in contrast to commonly used time-stepping methods which only achieve first-order accuracy. Considering rigid bodies with possible patch contacts results in nondifferentiable signed distance functions (SDF), which introduces additional nonsmoothness into the dynamical system. In this work, we utilize so-called equivalent contact points (ECP), which parameterize force and impulse distributions on contact patches by evaluation at single points. We embed a nondifferentiable SDF into a complementarity Lagrangian system (CLS) and show that the determined ECP are well-defined. We then extend the FESD-J discretization to the considered CLS such that its integration accuracy is maintained. The functionality of the method is illustrated for both a simulation and an optimal control example.</description>

      <title>Towards a connection between the capacitated vehicle routing problem and the constrained centroid-based clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently solving a vehicle routing problem (VRP) in a practical runtime is a critical challenge for delivery management companies. This paper explores both a theoretical and experimental connection between the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and the Constrained Centroid-Based Clustering (CCBC). Reducing a CVRP to a CCBC is a synonym for a transition from an exponential to a polynomial complexity using commonly known algorithms for clustering, i.e K-means. At the beginning, we conduct an exploratory analysis to highlight the existence of such a relationship between the two problems through illustrative small-size examples and simultaneously deduce some mathematically-related formulations and properties. On a second level, the paper proposes a CCBC based approach endowed with some enhancements. The proposed framework consists of three stages. At the first step, a constrained centroid-based clustering algorithm generates feasible clusters of customers. This methodology incorporates three enhancement tools to achieve near-optimal clusters, namely: a multi-start procedure for initial centroids, a customer assignment metric, and a self-adjustment mechanism for choosing the number of clusters. At the second step, a traveling salesman problem (T SP) solver is used to optimize the order of customers within each cluster. Finally, we introduce a process relying on routes cutting and relinking procedure, which calls upon solving a linear and integer programming model to further improve the obtained routes. This step is inspired by the ruin &amp; recreate algorithm. This approach is an extension of the classical cluster-first, route-second method and provides near-optimal solutions on well-known benchmark instances in terms of solution quality and computational runtime, offering a milestone in solving VRP.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Objective Gap and Gradient Norm Convergence for Gradient Descent via Long Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers gradient descent for L-smooth convex optimization with stepsizes larger than the classic regime where descent can be ensured. The stepsize schedules considered are similar to but differ slightly from the concurrently developed silver stepsizes of Altschuler and Parillo. For one of our stepsize sequences, we prove a $O\left(\frac{1}{N^{1.2716\dots}}\right)$ convergence rate in terms of objective gap decrease and for the other, we show the same rate of decrease for the squared-gradient-norm. This first result improves on the recent result of Altschuler and Parillo by a constant factor, while the second results improve on the exponent of the prior best squared-gradient-norm convergence guarantee of $O(\frac{1}{N})$.</description>

      <title>Addressing complex boundary conditions of miscible flow and transport in two and three dimensions with application to optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate complex boundary conditions of the miscible displacement system in two and three space dimensions with the commonly-used Bear-Scheidegger diffusion-dispersion tensor, which describes, e.g., the porous medium flow processes in petroleum reservoir simulation or groundwater contaminant transport. Specifically, we incorporate the no-flux boundary condition for the Darcy velocity to prove that the general no-flux boundary condition for the transport equation is equivalent to the normal derivative boundary condition of the concentration, based on which we further prove several complex boundary conditions by the Bear-Scheidegger tensor and its derivative. The derived boundary conditions not only provide new insights and distinct properties of the Bear-Scheidegger diffusion-dispersion tensor, but accommodate the coupling and the nonlinearity of the miscible displacement system and the Bear-Scheidegger tensor in deriving the first-order optimality condition of the corresponding optimal control problem for practical application.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Design for Quickest Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of quickest change detection (QCD) concerns design and analysis of algorithms to estimate in real time the time at which an important event takes place, and identify properties of the post-change behavior. It is shown in this paper that approaches based on reinforcement learning (RL) can be adapted based on any "surrogate information state" that is adapted to the observations. Hence we are left to choose both the surrogate information state process and the algorithm. For the former, it is argued that there are many choices available, based on a rich theory of asymptotic statistics for QCD. Two approaches to RL design are considered: (i) Stochastic gradient descent based on an actor-critic formulation. Theory is largely complete for this approach: the algorithm is unbiased, and will converge to a local minimum. However, it is shown that variance of stochastic gradients can be very large, necessitating the need for commensurately long run times; (ii) Q-learning algorithms based on a version of the projected Bellman equation. It is shown that the algorithm is stable, in the sense of bounded sample paths, and that a solution to the projected Bellman equation exists under mild conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate these findings, and provide a roadmap for algorithm design in more general settings.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of Uplink-Downlink Networked Control Systems with Energy Harvesting Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a wireless networked control system (WNCS) consisting of a plant, a battery-operated sensor, a controller, and an actuator. The battery in the sensor harvests energy from the environment. The sensor then uses this energy for packet transmissions. There are two types of wireless communication channels, (i) sensor--controller channel (also called uplink channel), and (ii) controller--actuator channel (also called downlink channel). The controller is \emph{half-duplex}, and this prevents it from simultaneously receiving an update from the sensor, and also transmitting a control packet to the actuator. Though frequent transmissions via uplink channel improve controller's estimate of the plant state, but this also reduces the timely control of the plant. Hence, in order to strike a balance between these two, we consider the problem of designing an optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the expected cumulative infinite horizon discounted cost, where the instantaneous cost is equal to the square of the plant state. At each time $t$, the scheduler at the sensor has to decide whether it should activate the uplink channel, or downlink. We pose this dynamic optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the state at time $t$ is composed of (i) the plant state $x(t)$, (ii) the age of the data packet available at the controller, denoted by $\tau(t)$, (iii) a binary variable $y(t)$ which indicates the availability of a control packet at the controller, and (iv) the energy level of the battery at the sensor $b(t)$. We show that there exists an optimal scheduling policy that exhibits a threshold structure, meaning that for each time $t$, if there is a control packet available with the controller, then the sensor activates the downlink channel in case $|x(t)|$ exceeds a threshold $x\ust(\tau(t),b(t))$.</description>

      <title>Multi Methods of Matrix Analysis Use for Control and Optimization system in Control Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix analysis plays a crucial role in the field of control engineering, providing a powerful mathematical framework for the analysis and design of control systems. This research report explores various applications of matrix analysis in control engineering, focusing on its contributions to system modeling, stability analysis, controllablity, observability, and optimization. The report also discusses specific examples and case studies to illustrate the practical significance of matrix analysis in addressing real-world control engineering challenges Analyze controllability. Informally, a system is controllable if we can construct a set of inputs that will drive the system to any given state. Analyze observability. Informally, observability means that by controlling the inputs and watching the outputs of a system we can determine what the states were. Optimal Control is a control method that aims to find the optimal control input to achieve the best performance of the system under certain constraints. This performance index can be the system output, energy consumption, time, etc.</description>

      <title>On unifying control barrier and Lyapunov functions using QP and Sontag's formula with an application to tumor dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common tool in system theory for formulating control laws that achieve local asymptotic stability are Control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), while Control Barrier functions (CBFs) are typically employed to enforce safety constraints. Combining these two types of functions is of interest, because it leads to stabilizing controllers with safety guarantees. A common approach to merge CLFs and CBFs is to solve an optimization problem where both CLF and CBF inequalities are imposed as constraints. In this paper, we show via an example from the literature that this approach can lead to undesirable behavior (i.e., slow convergence and oscillating inputs). Then, we propose a novel cost function that penalizes the deviation from Sontag's formula by using a state-dependent weighting matrix. We show that by minimizing the developed cost function subject to a CBF constraint, local asymptotic stability is obtained with an explicit domain of attraction, without using a CLF constraint. To deal with vanishing properties of the weight matrix as the state approaches the equilibrium, we introduce a hybrid continuous control law that recovers Sontag's formula locally. The effectiveness of the developed hybrid stabilizing control law based on CLFs and CBFs is illustrated in stabilization of a 3D tumor model, subject to physiological constraints (i.e., all states must be positive), which yields useful insights into optimal cancer treatment design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we work with Linear Switched Systems (LSS). We show the existence of minimality in innovation form for such systems. We also present a realization algorithm to compute a minimal LSS in innovation form, by calculating the covariances of the state-pace matrices. Finally, a system identification algorithm statically consistent is presented. The later, based on the realization algorithm, uses the collected data in order to compute the covariances of the inputs and outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of infinite horizon fully coupled McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). We propose a generalized monotonicity condition involving two flexible functions. Under this condition, we establish the well-posedness results for infinite horizon McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs by the method of continuation, including the unique solvability, an estimate of the solution, and the related continuous dependence property of the solution on the coefficients. Based on the solvability result, we study an infinite horizon mean field control problem. Moreover, by choosing appropriate form of the flexible functions, we can eliminate the different phenomenon between the linear-quadratic (LQ) problems on infinite horizon and finite horizon proposed in Wei and Yu (SIAM J. Control Optim. 59: 2594-2623, 2021).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CBXPy and ConsensusBasedX.jl, Python and Julia implementations of consensus-based interacting particle systems (CBX), which generalise consensus-based optimization methods (CBO) for global, derivative-free optimisation. The raison d'\^etre of our libraries is twofold: on the one hand, to offer high-performance implementations of CBX methods that the community can use directly, while on the other, providing a general interface that can accommodate and be extended to further variations of the CBX family. Python and Julia were selected as the leading high-level languages in terms of usage and performance, as well as their popularity among the scientific computing community. Both libraries have been developed with a common ethos, ensuring a similar API and core functionality, while leveraging the strengths of each language and writing idiomatic code.</description>

      <title>Modeling and optimization for arrays of water turbine OWC devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave energy conversion is emerging as a promising technology for generating energy from renewable sources. Large-scale implementation of this technology requires the installation of parks of devices. We study the problem of optimizing the park layout and control for wave energy converters of the oscillating water column type. As a test case, we consider a device with a semi-submerged chamber and a Wells turbine working in the liquid phase. First, a novel model based on a nonlinear ordinary differential equation is derived to describe the behavior of the water column and used to estimate the power matrix of an isolated device. Then, its linearization is derived in order to enable the fast simulation of large parks with a high number of devices. The choice of the hydrodynamic model allows obtaining the gradient of the power with respect to the positions through an adjoint approach, making it especially convenient for optimization. We consider in particular the case of interaction with the piles of a floating wind energy plant. The results from the developed computational framework allow us to draw interesting conclusions that are useful when designing the layout of a park. In particular, we observe that interaction effects can be significant even in parks made up of devices of small size, which would exhibit negligible diffraction and radiation properties in isolated conditions, if the number of devices is large enough. Moreover, results show that wave reflection from the piles of an offshore platform can have positive effects on energy production.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Indicators for Strength of Inequalities with Respect to a Polyhedron, Part I: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strength of inequalities used in mixed-integer programming, and in branch-and-cut algorithms that solve such problems. Strength is an ethereal property lacking good formal definition, but crucial for computational speed. We review several quantitative indicators proposed in the literature we claim provide a measure of the relative strength of inequalities with respect to a given polyhedron. We evaluate two of these indicators (extreme point ratio (EPR) and centroid distance (CD)) on various facet classes for both the traveling salesman polytope TSP, and spanning tree in hypergraph polytope STHGP, obtaining closed-forms for EPR and CD on each facet class. Within each facet class, the two indicators yield strikingly similar strength rankings, with excellent agreement on which facets are strongest and which are weakest. Both indicators corroborate all known computational experience with both polytopes. The indicators also reveal previously unknown properties of STHGP subtours. We also evaluate EPR and CD for the subtour inequalities of the spanning tree in graphs polytope STGP, obtaining surprising and unexpected results that (at least for STGP and STHGP subtours) lead us to believe EPR to be a more accurate estimate of strength than CD. Applications include: comparing the relative strength of different classes of inequalities; design of rapidly-converging separation algorithms; design or justification for constraint strengthening procedures.
  The companion paper exploits one of the newly revealed properties of STHGP subtours in GeoSteiner, with detailed computational results. Across all distance metrics and instances studied, these results are remarkable -- culminating with an optimal solution of a 1,000,000 terminal random Euclidean instance. This confirms these indicators to be highly predictive and strongly correlated with actual computational strength.</description>

Abstract: The first paper explored two strength indicators (extreme point ratio (EPR) and centroid distance (CD)), both of which predict that subtours of the spanning tree in hypergraph polytope STHGP having large cardinality are significantly stronger than the corresponding subtours of small cardinality. In this second paper, we exploit this previously unknown property algorithmically within GeoSteiner, presenting strong computational evidence that the EPR and CD indicators are highly predictive of actual computational strength, at least for subtour inequalities of STHGP. The GeoSteiner package for geometric Steiner trees in the plane uses STHGP to solve the Full Steiner Tree (FST) concatenation problem. The separation algorithms in previous versions of GeoSteiner find violated subtours of only relatively small cardinality, and we examine the underlying algorithmic causes. We present improvements in GeoSteiner specifically designed to strengthen violated subtours by augmentation (instead of reduction), yielding violated subtours of large cardinality. Across all distance metrics and instance classes studied, the computational results are remarkable -- culminating with an optimal solution of a 1,000,000 terminal random Euclidean instance. The conclusion is that the EPR and CD strength indicators presented in the first paper have strong predictive power regarding actual computational strength (at least regarding STHGP subtours). The ability to accurately measure the strength of inequalities has numerous applications of great importance, both in theory and practice.</description>

      <title>A Joint Optimization Approach for Power-Efficient Heterogeneous OFDMA Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous networks have emerged as a popular solution for accommodating the growing number of connected devices and increasing traffic demands in cellular networks. While offering broader coverage, higher capacity, and lower latency, the escalating energy consumption poses sustainability challenges. In this paper a novel optimization approach for OFDMA heterogeneous networks is proposed to minimize transmission power while respecting individual users throughput constraints. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer geometric program, and optimizes at once multiple system variables such as user association, working bandwidth, and base stations transmission powers. Crucially, the proposed approach becomes a convex optimization problem when user-base station associations are provided. Evaluations in multiple realistic scenarios from the production mobile network of a major European operator and based on precise channel gains and throughput requirements from measured data validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Overall, our original solution paves the road for greener connectivity by reducing the energy footprint of heterogeneous mobile networks, hence fostering more sustainable communication systems.</description>

      <title>Rescue Craft Allocation in Tidal Waters of the North and Baltic Sea</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the average response time for naval accidents in the North and Baltic Sea. To do this we optimize the strategic distribution of the vessel fleet used by the Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Rettung Schiffbr\"uchiger (German Maritime Search and Rescue Service) (DGzRS) across several home stations. Based on these locations, in case of an incoming distress call the vessel with the lowest response time is dispatched. A particularity of the region considered is the fact that due to low tide, at predictable times some vessels and stations are not operational. In our work, we build a corresponding mathematical model for the allocation of rescue crafts to multiple stations. Thereafter, we show that the problem is NP-hard. Next, we provide an Integer Programming (IP) formulation. Finally, we propose several methods of simplifying the model and do a case study to compare their effectiveness. For this, we generate test instances based on real-world data.</description>

      <title>Control of Medical Digital Twins with Artificial Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of personalized medicine is to tailor interventions to an individual patient's unique characteristics. A key technology for this purpose involves medical digital twins, computational models of human biology that can be personalized and dynamically updated to incorporate patient-specific data collected over time. Certain aspects of human biology, such as the immune system, are not easily captured with physics-based models, such as differential equations. Instead, they are often multi-scale, stochastic, and hybrid. This poses a challenge to existing model-based control and optimization approaches that cannot be readily applied to such models. Recent advances in automatic differentiation and neural-network control methods hold promise in addressing complex control problems. However, the application of these approaches to biomedical systems is still in its early stages. This work introduces dynamics-informed neural-network controllers as an alternative approach to control of medical digital twins. As a first use case for this method, the focus is on agent-based models, a versatile and increasingly common modeling platform in biomedicine. The effectiveness of the proposed neural-network control method is illustrated and benchmarked against other methods with two widely-used agent-based model types. The relevance of the method introduced here extends beyond medical digital twins to other complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A necessary condition for non-monotonic dose response, with an application to a kinetic proofreading model -- Extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steady state non-monotonic ("biphasic") dose responses are often observed in experimental biology, which raises the control-theoretic question of identifying which possible mechanisms might underlie such behaviors. It is well known that the presence of an incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL) in a network may give rise to a non-monotonic response. It has been conjectured that this condition is also necessary, i.e. that a non-monotonic response implies the existence of an IFFL. In this paper, we show that this conjecture is false, and in the process prove a weaker version: that either an IFFL must exist or both a positive loop and a negative feedback loop must exist. Towards this aim, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for when minors of a symbolic matrix have mixed signs. Finally, we study in full generality when a model of immune T-cell activation could exhibit a steady state non-monotonic dose response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent works on the theory of machine learning, it has been observed that heavy tail properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) can be studied in the probabilistic framework of stochastic recursions. In particular, G\"{u}rb\"{u}zbalaban et al. (arXiv:2006.04740) considered a setup corresponding to linear regression for which iterations of SGD can be modelled by a multivariate affine stochastic recursion $X_k=A_k X_{k-1}+B_k$, for independent and identically distributed pairs $(A_k, B_k)$, where $A_k$ is a random symmetric matrix and $B_k$ is a random vector. In this work, we will answer several open questions of the quoted paper and extend their results by applying the theory of irreducible-proximal (i-p) matrices.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of optimization problems involving the optimal operation of a single lossy energy storage system that incurs energy loss when charging or discharging. Such inefficiencies in the energy storage dynamics are known to result in a nonconvex set of feasible charging and discharging power profiles. In this letter, we provide an equivalent reformulation for this class of optimization problems, along with sufficient conditions for the convexity of the proposed reformulation. The conditions provided generalize existing conditions for convexity in the literature.</description>

      <title>Performance-Guaranteed Solutions for Multi-Agent Optimal Coverage Problems using Submodularity, Curvature, and Greedy Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of multi-agent optimal coverage problems where the goal is to determine the optimal placement of a group of agents in a given mission space such that they maximize a joint ``coverage'' objective. This class of problems is extremely challenging due to the non-convex nature of the mission space and of the coverage objective. With this motivation, we propose to use a greedy algorithm as a means of getting feasible coverage solutions efficiently. Even though such greedy solutions are suboptimal, the submodularity (diminishing returns) property of the coverage objective can be exploited to provide performance bound guarantees - not only for the greedy solutions but also for any subsequently improved solutions. Moreover, we show that improved performance bound guarantees (beyond the standard (1-1/e) performance bound) can be established using various curvature measures that further characterize the considered coverage problem. In particular, we provide a brief review of all existing popular curvature measures found in the submodular maximization literature, including a recent curvature measure that we proposed, and discuss in detail their applicability, practicality, and effectiveness in the context of optimal coverage problems. Moreover, we characterize the dependence of the effectiveness of different curvature measures (in providing improved performance bound guarantees) on the agent sensing capabilities. Finally, we provide several numerical results to support our findings and propose several potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>Automatic Outlier Rectification via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel conceptual framework to detect outliers using optimal transport with a concave cost function. Conventional outlier detection approaches typically use a two-stage procedure: first, outliers are detected and removed, and then estimation is performed on the cleaned data. However, this approach does not inform outlier removal with the estimation task, leaving room for improvement. To address this limitation, we propose an automatic outlier rectification mechanism that integrates rectification and estimation within a joint optimization framework. We take the first step to utilize an optimal transport distance with a concave cost function to construct a rectification set in the space of probability distributions. Then, we select the best distribution within the rectification set to perform the estimation task. Notably, the concave cost function we introduced in this paper is the key to making our estimator effectively identify the outlier during the optimization process. We discuss the fundamental differences between our estimator and optimal transport-based distributionally robust optimization estimator. finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over conventional approaches in extensive simulation and empirical analyses for mean estimation, least absolute regression, and the fitting of option implied volatility surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a stochastic/robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to enhance the robustness of legged locomotion against contact uncertainties. We integrate the contact uncertainties into the covariance propagation of stochastic/robust NMPC framework by leveraging the guard saltation matrix and an extended Kalman filter-like covariance update. We achieve fast stochastic/robust NMPC computation by utilizing the zero-order stochastic/robust NMPC algorithm with additional improvements in computational efficiency concerning the feedback gains. We conducted numerical experiments and demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately forecast future state covariance and generate trajectories that satisfies constraints even in the presence of the contact uncertainties. Hardware experiments on the perceptive locomotion of a wheeled-legged robot were also carried out, validating the feasibility of the proposed method in a real-world system with limited on-board computation.</description>

      <title>Conservative Linear Envelopes for High-Dimensional, Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability for Nonlinear Systems via the Hopf Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) analysis provides a value function that encodes (1) the set of states from which a nonlinear system with bounded control inputs can reach a goal (or avoid a failure set) despite any bounded disturbance, and (2) the corresponding optimal control policy to reach (or avoid). Though powerful, traditional methods for HJR rely on dynamic programming and suffer from exponential computation growth with respect to state dimension. The recently favored Hopf formula mitigates this ''curse of dimensionality'' by providing an efficient and space-parallelizable approach for solving the reachability problem. However, the Hopf formula can only be applied to linear time-varying systems. To overcome this limitation, we show that the error between a nonlinear system and a linear model can be transformed into an adversarial bounded artificial disturbance, making an envelope of the true value. One may then solve the dimension-robust Hopf formula for a linear game with this ''antagonistic error" to perform guaranteed conservative reachability analysis and control synthesis of nonlinear systems; this can be done for problem formulations in which no other HJR method is both computationally feasible and guaranteed. In addition, we offer several technical methods for reducing conservativeness in the analysis. We demonstrate the theory by solving the safe linear envelope in the controlled Van der Pol system, where the true reachable set may be observed, and by solving a 5 agent (15D) pursuit-evasion game with Dubins cars.</description>

      <title>Regularized Adaptive Momentum Dual Averaging with an Efficient Inexact Subproblem Solver for Training Structured Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Regularized Adaptive Momentum Dual Averaging (RAMDA) algorithm for training structured neural networks. Similar to existing regularized adaptive methods, the subproblem for computing the update direction of RAMDA involves a nonsmooth regularizer and a diagonal preconditioner, and therefore does not possess a closed-form solution in general. We thus also carefully devise an implementable inexactness condition that retains convergence guarantees similar to the exact versions, and propose a companion efficient solver for the subproblems of both RAMDA and existing methods to make them practically feasible. We leverage the theory of manifold identification in variational analysis to show that, even in the presence of such inexactness, the iterates of RAMDA attain the ideal structure induced by the regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence. This structure is locally optimal near the point of convergence, so RAMDA is guaranteed to obtain the best structure possible among all methods converging to the same point, making it the first regularized adaptive method outputting models that possess outstanding predictive performance while being (locally) optimally structured. Extensive numerical experiments in large-scale modern computer vision, language modeling, and speech tasks show that the proposed RAMDA is efficient and consistently outperforms state of the art for training structured neural network. Implementation of our algorithm is available at http://www.github.com/ismoptgroup/RAMDA/.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for end-to-end learning of Koopman surrogate models for optimal performance in control. In contrast to previous contributions that employ standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, we use a training algorithm that exploits the potential differentiability of environments based on mechanistic simulation models. We evaluate the performance of our method by comparing it to that of other controller type and training algorithm combinations on a literature known eNMPC case study. Our method exhibits superior performance on this problem, thereby constituting a promising avenue towards more capable controllers that employ dynamic surrogate models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose and investigate a strategy to prevent consensus in kinetic models for opinion formation. We consider a large interacting agent system, and assume that agent interactions are driven by compromise as well as self-thinking dynamics and also modulated by an underlying static social network. This network structure is included using so-called graphons, which modulate the interaction frequency in the corresponding kinetic formulation. We then derive the corresponding limiting Fokker Planck equation, and analyze its large time behavior. This microscopic setting serves as a starting point for the proposed control strategy, which steers agents away from mean opinion and is characterised by a suitable penalization depending on the properties of the graphon. We show that this minimalist approach is very effective by analyzing the quasi-stationary solutions mean-field model in a plurality of graphon structures. Several numerical experiments are also provided the show the effectiveness of the approach in preventing the formation of consensus steering the system towards a declustered state.</description>

Abstract: The problem of quantum state preparation is one of the main challenges in achieving the quantum advantage. Furthermore, classically, for multi-level problems, our ability to solve the corresponding quantum optimal control problems is rather limited. The ability of the latter to feed into the former may result in significant progress in quantum computing. To address this challenge, we propose a formulation of quantum optimal control that makes use of artificial boundary conditions for the Schr\"odinger equation in combination with spectral methods. The resulting formulations are well suited for investigating periodic potentials and lend themselves to direct numerical treatment using conventional methods for bounded domains.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a memory efficient, first-order method for low multi-linear rank approximation of high-order, high-dimensional tensors. In our method, we exploit the second-order information of the cost function and the constraints to suggest a new Riemannian metric on the Grassmann manifold. We use a Riemmanian coordinate descent method for solving the problem, and also provide a global convergence analysis matching that of the coordinate descent method in the Euclidean setting. We also show that each step of our method with the unit step-size is actually a step of the orthogonal iteration algorithm. Experimental results show the computational advantage of our method for high-dimensional tensors.</description>

      <title>Application of tropical optimization for solving multicriteria problems of pairwise comparisons using log-Chebyshev approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a decision-making problem to find absolute ratings of alternatives that are compared in pairs under multiple criteria, subject to constraints in the form of two-sided bounds on ratios between the ratings. Given matrices of pairwise comparisons made according to the criteria, the problem is formulated as the log-Chebyshev approximation of these matrices by a common consistent matrix (a symmetrically reciprocal matrix of unit rank) to minimize the approximation errors for all matrices simultaneously. We rearrange the approximation problem as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem of finding a vector that determines the approximating consistent matrix. The problem is then represented in the framework of tropical algebra, which deals with the theory and applications of idempotent semirings and provides a formal basis for fuzzy and interval arithmetic. We apply methods and results of tropical optimization to develop a new approach for handling the multiobjective optimization problem according to various principles of optimality. New complete solutions in the sense of the max-ordering, lexicographic ordering and lexicographic max-ordering optimality are obtained, which are given in a compact vector form ready for formal analysis and efficient computation. We present numerical examples of solving multicriteria problems of rating four alternatives from pairwise comparisons to illustrate the technique and compare it with others.</description>

Abstract: Suppose that the origin is globally asymptotically stable under a set of continuous vector fields on Euclidean space and suppose that all those vector fields come equipped with -- possibly different -- convex Lyapunov functions. We show that this implies there is a homotopy between any two of those vector fields such that the origin remains globally asymptotically stable along the homotopy. Relaxing the assumption on the origin to any compact convex set or relaxing convexity to geodesic convexity does not alter the conclusion. Imposing the same convexity assumptions on control Lyapunov functions leads to a Hautus-like stabilizability test. These results ought to be of interest in the context of learning stability certificates, policy gradient methods and switched systems.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Methods for Multi-Block Optimization Problems over Transport Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on multi-block optimization problems over transport polytopes, which underlie various applications including strongly correlated quantum physics and machine learning. Conventional block coordinate descent-type methods for the general multi-block problems store and operate on the matrix variables directly, resulting in formidable expenditure for large-scale settings. On the other hand, optimal transport problems, as a special case, have attracted extensive attention and numerical techniques that waive the use of the full matrices have recently emerged. However, it remains nontrivial to apply these techniques to the multi-block, possibly nonconvex problems with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we leverage the benefits of both sides and develop novel sampling-based block coordinate descent-type methods, which are equipped with either entropy regularization or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Each iteration of these methods solves subproblems restricted on the sampled degrees of freedom. Consequently, they involve only sparse matrices, which amounts to considerable complexity reductions. We explicitly characterize the sampling-induced errors and establish convergence and asymptotic properties for the methods equipped with the entropy regularization. Numerical experiments on typical strongly correlated electron systems corroborate their superior scalability over the methods utilizing full matrices. The advantage also enables the first visualization of approximate optimal transport maps between electron positions in three-dimensional contexts.</description>

      <title>An efficient sieving based secant method for sparse optimization problems with least-squares constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient sieving based secant method to address the computational challenges of solving sparse optimization problems with least-squares constraints. A level-set method has been introduced in [X. Li, D.F. Sun, and K.-C. Toh, SIAM J. Optim., 28 (2018), pp. 1842--1866] that solves these problems by using the bisection method to find a root of a univariate nonsmooth equation $\varphi(\lambda) = \varrho$ for some $\varrho &gt; 0$, where $\varphi(\cdot)$ is the value function computed by a solution of the corresponding regularized least-squares optimization problem. When the objective function in the constrained problem is a polyhedral gauge function, we prove that (i) for any positive integer $k$, $\varphi(\cdot)$ is piecewise $C^k$ in an open interval containing the solution $\lambda^*$ to the equation $\varphi(\lambda) = \varrho$; (ii) the Clarke Jacobian of $\varphi(\cdot)$ is always positive. These results allow us to establish the essential ingredients of the fast convergence rates of the secant method. Moreover, an adaptive sieving technique is incorporated into the secant method to effectively reduce the dimension of the level-set subproblems for computing the value of $\varphi(\cdot)$. The high efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by extensive numerical results.</description>

      <title>An iterative sample scenario approach for the dynamic dispatch waves problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A challenge in same-day delivery operations is that delivery requests are typically not known beforehand, but are instead revealed dynamically during the day. This uncertainty introduces a trade-off between dispatching vehicles to serve requests as soon as they are revealed to ensure timely delivery, and delaying the dispatching decision to consolidate routing decisions with future, currently unknown requests. In this paper, we study the dynamic dispatch waves problem, a same-day delivery problem in which vehicles are dispatched at fixed decision moments. At each decision moment, the system operator must decide which of the known requests to dispatch, and how to route these dispatched requests. The operator's goal is to minimize the total routing cost while ensuring that all requests are served on time. We propose iterative conditional dispatch (ICD), an iterative solution construction procedure based on a sample scenario approach. ICD iteratively solves sample scenarios to classify requests to be dispatched, postponed, or undecided. The set of undecided requests shrinks in each iteration until a final dispatching decision is made in the last iteration. We develop two variants of ICD: one variant based on thresholds, and another variant based on similarity. A significant strength of ICD is that it is conceptually simple and easy to implement. This simplicity does not harm performance: through rigorous numerical experiments, we show that both variants efficiently navigate the large state and action spaces of the dynamic dispatch waves problem and quickly converge to a high-quality solution. Finally, we demonstrate that the threshold-based ICD variant achieves excellent results on instances from the EURO meets NeurIPS 2022 vehicle routing competition, nearly matching the performance of the winning machine learning-based strategy.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a problem of simultaneous input-output feedback linearization and decoupling (non-interacting) for mechanical control systems with outputs. We show that the natural requirement of preserving mechanical structure of the system and of transformations imposes supplementary conditions when compared to the classical solution of the same problem for general control systems. These conditions can be expressed using objects on the configuration space only. We illustrate our results with several examples of mechanical control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conflict graph represents logical relations between binary variables, and effective use of the graph can significantly accelerate branch-and-cut solvers for mixed-integer programming (MIP). In this paper we develop efficient parallel conflict graph management: conflict detection; maximal clique generation; clique extension; and clique merging. We leverage parallel computing in order to intensify computational effort on the conflict graph, thereby generating a much larger pool of cutting planes than what can be practically achieved in serial. Computational experiments demonstrate that the expanded pool of cuts enabled by parallel computing lead to substantial reductions in total MIP solve time, especially for more challenging cases.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Lookahead Strong Branching via a Stochastic Abstract Branching Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong Branching (SB) is a cornerstone of all modern branching rules used in the Branch-and-Bound (BnB) algorithm, which is at the center of Mixed-Integer Programming solvers. In its full form, SB evaluates all variables to branch on and then selects the one producing the best relaxation, leading to small trees, but high runtimes. State-of-the-art branching rules therefore use SB with working limits to achieve both small enough trees and short run times. So far, these working limits have been established empirically. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical approach to guide how much SB to use at each node within the BnB. We first define an abstract stochastic tree model of the BnB algorithm where the geometric mean dual gains of all variables follow a given probability distribution. This model allows us to relate expected dual gains to tree sizes and explicitly compare the cost of sampling an additional SB candidate with the reward in expected tree size reduction. We then leverage the insight from the abstract model to design a new stopping criterion for SB, which fits a distribution to the dual gains and, at each node, dynamically continues or interrupts SB. This algorithm, which we refer to as Probabilistic Lookahead Strong Branching, improves both the tree size and runtime over MIPLIB instances, providing evidence that the method not only changes the amount of SB, but allocates it better.</description>

      <title>Complexity of trust-region methods with unbounded Hessian approximations for smooth and nonsmooth optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a worst-case evaluation complexity bound for trust-region methods in the presence of unbounded Hessian approximations. We use the algorithm of arXiv:2103.15993v3 as a model, which is designed for nonsmooth regularized problems, but applies to unconstrained smooth problems as a special case. Our analysis assumes that the growth of the Hessian approximation is controlled by the number of successful iterations. We show that the best known complexity bound of $\epsilon^{-2}$ deteriorates to $\epsilon^{-2/(1-p)}$, where $0 \le p &lt; 1$ is a parameter that controls the growth of the Hessian approximation. The faster the Hessian approximation grows, the more the bound deteriorates. We construct an objective that satisfies all of our assumptions and for which our complexity bound is attained, which establishes that our bound is sharp. Numerical experiments conducted in double precision arithmetic are consistent with the analysis.</description>

      <title>Tropical modeling of battery swapping and charging station</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a queueing model of a battery swapping and charging station (BSCS) for electric vehicles (EVs). A new approach to the analysis of the queueing model is developed, which combines the representation of the model as a stochastic dynamic system with the use of the methods and results of tropical algebra, which deals with the theory and applications of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. We describe the dynamics of the queueing model by a system of recurrence equations that involve random variables (RVs) to represent the interarrival time of incoming EVs. A performance measure for the model is defined as the mean operation cycle time of the station. Furthermore, the system of equations is represented in terms of the tropical algebra in vector form as an implicit linear state dynamic equation. The performance measure takes on the meaning of the mean growth rate of the state vector (the Lyapunov exponent) of the dynamic system. By applying a solution technique of vector equations in tropical algebra, the implicit equation is transformed into an explicit one with a state transition matrix with random entries. The evaluation of the Lyapunov exponent reduces to finding the limit of the expected value of norms of tropical matrix products. This limit is then obtained using results from the tropical spectral theory of deterministic and random matrices. With this approach, we derive a new exact formula for the mean cycle time of the BSCS, which is given in terms of the expected value of the RVs involved. We present the results of the Monte Carlo simulation of the BSCS's operation, which show a good agreement with the exact solution. The application of the obtained solution to evaluate the performance of one BSCS and to find the optimal distribution of battery packs between stations in a network of BSCSs is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) are a highly expressive class of nonconvex optimization problems. While QCQPs are NP-hard in general, they admit a natural convex relaxation via the standard semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation. In this paper we study when the convex hull of the epigraph of a QCQP coincides with the projected epigraph of the SDP relaxation. We present a sufficient condition for convex hull exactness and show that this condition is further necessary under an additional geometric assumption. The sufficient condition is based on geometric properties of $\Gamma$, the cone of convex Lagrange multipliers, and its relatives $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma^\circ$.</description>

Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to establish the Ahlfors regularity of minimizers of set functions that satisfy a suitable maxitive condition on disjoint unions of sets. Our analysis focuses on minimizers within continua of the plane with finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Through quantitative estimates, we prove that the length of a minimizer inside the ball centered at one of its points is comparable to the radius of the ball. By operating within an abstract framework, we are able to encompass a diverse range of entities, including spectral functionals defined in terms of the eigenvalues of elliptic operators, the inradius, and the maximum of the torsion function. These entities are of interest for several applications, such as structural engineering, urban planning, and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Callable convertible bonds under liquidity constraints and hybrid priorities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the callable convertible bond problem in the presence of a liquidity constraint modelled by Poisson signals. We assume that neither the bondholder nor the firm has absolute priority when they stop the game simultaneously, but instead, a proportion $m\in[0,1]$ of the bond is converted to the firm's stock and the rest is called by the firm. The paper thus generalizes the special case studied in [Liang and Sun, Dynkin games with Poisson random intervention times, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 57 (2019), 2962-2991] where the bondholder has priority ($m=1$), and presents a complete solution to the callable convertible bond problem with liquidity constraint. The callable convertible bond is an example of a Dynkin game, but falls outside the standard paradigm since the payoffs do not depend in an ordered way upon which agent stops the game. We show how to deal with this non-ordered situation by introducing a new technique which may be of interest in its own right, and then apply it to the bond problem.</description>

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations describe how to modify a feature vector in order to flip the outcome of a trained classifier. Obtaining robust counterfactual explanations is essential to provide valid algorithmic recourse and meaningful explanations. We study the robustness of explanations of randomized ensembles, which are always subject to algorithmic uncertainty even when the training data is fixed. We formalize the generation of robust counterfactual explanations as a probabilistic problem and show the link between the robustness of ensemble models and the robustness of base learners. We develop a practical method with good empirical performance and support it with theoretical guarantees for ensembles of convex base learners. Our results show that existing methods give surprisingly low robustness: the validity of naive counterfactuals is below $50\%$ on most data sets and can fall to $20\%$ on problems with many features. In contrast, our method achieves high robustness with only a small increase in the distance from counterfactual explanations to their initial observations.</description>

      <title>Neural Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Maximum Mean Discrepancies with Riesz Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flows of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) functionals with non-smooth Riesz kernels show a rich structure as singular measures can become absolutely continuous ones and conversely. In this paper we contribute to the understanding of such flows. We propose to approximate the backward scheme of Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto for computing such Wasserstein gradient flows as well as a forward scheme for so-called Wasserstein steepest descent flows by neural networks (NNs). Since we cannot restrict ourselves to absolutely continuous measures, we have to deal with transport plans and velocity plans instead of usual transport maps and velocity fields. Indeed, we approximate the disintegration of both plans by generative NNs which are learned with respect to appropriate loss functions. In order to evaluate the quality of both neural schemes, we benchmark them on the interaction energy. Here we provide analytic formulas for Wasserstein schemes starting at a Dirac measure and show their convergence as the time step size tends to zero. Finally, we illustrate our neural MMD flows by numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose conditional flows of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with the negative distance kernel for posterior sampling and conditional generative modeling. This MMD, which is also known as energy distance, has several advantageous properties like efficient computation via slicing and sorting. We approximate the joint distribution of the ground truth and the observations using discrete Wasserstein gradient flows and establish an error bound for the posterior distributions. Further, we prove that our particle flow is indeed a Wasserstein gradient flow of an appropriate functional. The power of our method is demonstrated by numerical examples including conditional image generation and inverse problems like superresolution, inpainting and computed tomography in low-dose and limited-angle settings.</description>

Abstract: Consider a matroid where all elements are labeled with an element in $\mathbb{Z}$. We are interested in finding a base where the sum of the labels is congruent to $g \pmod m$. We show that this problem can be solved in $\tilde{O}(2^{4m} n r^{5/6})$ time for a matroid with $n$ elements and rank $r$, when $m$ is either the product of two primes or a prime power. The algorithm can be generalized to all moduli and, in fact, to all abelian groups if a classic additive combinatorics conjecture by Schrijver and Seymour holds true. We also discuss the optimization version of the problem.</description>
