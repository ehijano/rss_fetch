      <title>Nonlinear Spectroscopy as a Magnon Breakdown Diagnosis and its Efficient Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying quantum spin liquids, magnon breakdown, or fractionalized excitations in quantum magnets is an ongoing challenge due to the ambiguity of possible origins of excitation continua occurring in linear response probes. Recently, it was proposed that techniques measuring higher-order response, such as two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), could resolve such ambiguities. Numerically simulating nonlinear response functions can, however, be computationally very demanding. We present an efficient Lanczos-based method to compute second-order susceptibilities $\chi^{2}\omega_t,\omega_\tau)$ directly in the frequency domain. Applying this to extended Kitaev models describing $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, we find qualitatively different nonlinear responses between intermediate magnetic field strengths and the high-field regime. To put these results into context, we derive the general 2DCS response of partially-polarized magnets within the linear spin-wave approximation, establishing that $\chi^2(\omega_t,\omega_\tau)$ is restricted to a distinct universal form if the excitations are conventional magnons. Deviations from this form, as predicted in our (Lanczos-based) simulations for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, can hence serve in 2DCS experiments as direct criteria to determine whether an observed excitation continuum is of conventional two-magnon type or of different nature.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum oscillations, linear magnetoresistance, and crystalline electric field effect in quasi-two-dimensional PrAgBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties with electronic band structure calculation of the Bi square net system PrAgBi$_2$. The magnetization and heat capacity data confirm the presence of a crystalline electric field (CEF) effect in PrAgBi$_2$. Analysis of the CEF effect using a multilevel energy scheme reveals that the ground state of PrAgBi$_2$ consists of five singlets and two doublets. The de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillations data show a single frequency with a very small cyclotron effective mass of approximately 0.11 $m_e$. A nontrivial Berry phase is also observed from the quantum oscillations data. The magnetotransport data shows linear and unsaturated magnetoresistance, reaching up to 1060\% at 2 K and 9 T. Notably, there is a crossover from a weak-field quadratic dependence to a high-field linear dependence in the field-dependent magnetoresistance data. The crossover critical field $B^*$ follows the quadratic temperature dependence, indicating the existence of Dirac fermions. The band structure calculation shows several Dirac-like linear band dispersions near the Fermi level and a Dirac point close to the Fermi level, located at the Brillouin zone boundary. \textit{Ab inito} calculations allowed us to ascribe the observed dHvA oscillation frequency to a particular feature of the Fermi surface. Our study suggests layered PrAgBi$_2$ is a plausible candidate for hosting the CEF effect and Dirac fermion in the Bi square net.</description>

      <title>High-pressure modulation of breathing kagome lattice: Cascade of Lifshitz transitions and evolution of the electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between electronic correlations, density wave orders, and magnetism gives rise to several fascinating phenomena. In recent years, kagome metals have emerged as an excellent platform for investigating these unique properties, which stem from their itinerant carriers arranged in a kagome lattice. Here, we show that electronic structure of the prototypical kagome metal, Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, can be tailored by manipulating the breathing distortion of its kagome lattice with external pressure. The breathing distortion is suppressed around 15 GPa and reversed at higher pressures. These changes lead to a series of Lifshitz transitions that we detect using broadband and transient optical spectroscopy. Remarkably, the strength of the electronic correlations and the tendency to carrier localization are enhanced as the kagome network becomes more regular, suggesting that breathing distortion can be a unique control parameter for the microscopic regime of the kagome metals and their electron dynamics.</description>

      <title>Charge Order Driven Multiferroic Behaviour in Sr$_4$Fe$_6$O$_{12}$: An $\textit{Ab-initio}$ Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we report the structural, electronic and ferroelectric properties of the layered mixed-valent transition-metal compound, Sr$_{4}$Fe$_{6}$O$_{12}$ (SFO). We demonstrate how SFO undergoes a phase transition from a high-temperature (T) centrosymmetric tetragonal phase ($P4_{2}/mnm$) to a low-T polar orthorhombic phase ($Pmn2_{1}$). The transition is primarily driven by charge ordering at tetrahedral Fe-layer creating Fe$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$ cations between two edge sharing tetrahedra. This charge ordering induces electronic polarization, which is remarkably larger (3.5 times) in magnitude than ionic polarization and oppositely directed, giving a net polarization of 0.05 C/m$^2$ which is comparable to the state-of-the-art rare-earth nickelets and manganite perovskites. The direction of structural distortion, governed by the polar mode irrep $\Gamma_{5}^{-}$, depends sensitively on the type of magnetic ordering in the Fe-octahedral layer. Consequently, both the ionic and electronic polarization directions are influenced by magnetic ordering, suggesting the potential for multiferroic behavior with strong magneto-electric coupling in this material.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced Dynamics and Momentum Distribution of Chiral Charge Density Waves in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the photoinduced dynamics of chiral states offers promising avenues for advanced control of condensed matter systems. Photoinduced or photoenhanced chirality in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$ has been suggested as a fascinating platform for optical manipulation of chiral states. However, the mechanisms underlying chirality training and its interplay with the charge density wave (CDW) phase remain elusive. Here, we use time-resolved X-ray diffraction (tr-XRD) with circularly polarized pump lasers to probe the photoinduced dynamics of chirality in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$. We observe a notable ($\sim$20%) difference in CDW intensity suppression between left- and right-circularly polarized pumps. Additionally, we reveal momentum-resolved circular dichroism arising from domains of different chirality, providing a direct link between CDW and chirality. An immediate increase in CDW correlation length upon laser pumping is detected, suggesting the photoinduced expansion of chiral domains. These results both advance the potential of light-driven chirality by elucidating the mechanism driving chirality manipulation in TiSe$_2$, and they demonstrate that tr-XRD with circularly polarized pumps is an effective tool for chirality detection in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions of two magnetic impurities in twisted bilayer graphene away from the magic angle. We apply the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of two graphene layers twisted with respect to each other by a small angle. By reducing the model to the Dirac-type one with modified Fermi velocity, we derive expressions for the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin interactions using perturbation theory for the free energy. The biquadratic interaction is suppressed by a larger power of the interaction constant and decreases faster with a the distance between impurities comparing to the quadratic one. Nevertheless, due to the different period of oscillations with impurity separation distance, chemical potential, twist angle and temperature, it is possible to fine-tune the system to the regime of dominating biquadratic interaction. Such a regime might be characterized by non-conventional spin order parameters such as quadrupole order.</description>

      <title>Suppression of ferromagnetism in rippled La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane with process-induced strain prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal oxides are a platform for exploring strain-engineered intriguing physical properties and developing spintronic or flexible electronic functionalities owing to strong coupling of spin, charge and lattice degrees of freedom. In this study, we exemplify the strain-engineered magnetism of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ in freestanding and rippled membrane forms without and with process-induced strain, respectively, prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique. We find that the deposition of Pt/Ti stressor suppresses the crack formation in the lift-off process and induces a ripple structure in the La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane. Laser micrograph and Raman spectroscopy show a ripple period of about 30 um and a height of a few um, where alternating convex and concave structures are subjected to tensile strain of 0.6% and compressive strain of 0.5%, respectively. While the freestanding La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, the macroscopic magnetic transition temperature (TC) of the rippled membrane is reduced by as large as 27%. Temperature-variable Kerr microscopy observation in the rippled membrane reveals that the spatial variation of TC to be approximately 4% of the macroscopic TC, which coincides with the local strains at convex and concave structures. The large reduction of macroscopic TC in the rippled membrane may be ascribed to the lattice disorders due to strain gradient. Our demonstration of tuning ferromagnetism by the ripple structure validates the high potential of the process-induced strain in epitaxial lift-off technique and paves the way for strain-mediated emerging physical properties in various transition metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced structural and superconducting transitions in black arsenic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report high-pressure Raman spectra and resistance measurements of black arsenic (b-As) up to 58 GPa, along with phonon density of states (DOS) and enthalpy calculations for four reported arsenic phases up to 50 GPa. It is found that metastable b-As transforms into gray arsenic (g-As) phase at a critical pressure of 1.51 GPa, followed by subsequent transitions to simple cubic arsenic (c-As) and incommensurate host-guest arsenic (hg-As) phases at 25.9 and 44.8 GPa, respectively. Superconductivity emerges above 25 GPa in the c-As phase, with the superconducting transition temperature ($T$$\rm_c$) remaining nearly a constant of 3 K. Upon further compression, $T$$\rm_c$ steeply increases to a higher value around 4.5 K in the incommensurate hg-As phase above 43 GPa. We use our results to update the structural and superconducting phase diagrams under pressure for the novel semiconductor, black arsenic.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle interference on the surface of Bi$_{\mathbf{2}}$Se$_{\mathbf{3}}$ terminated (PbSe)$_{\mathbf 5}$(Bi$_{\mathbf 2}$Se$_{\mathbf 3}$)$_{\mathbf 6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of topological superconductors derived from $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$, $\mathrm{Cu}_x(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ is unique in its surface termination of a single quintuple layer (QL) of the topological insulator (TI) $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$ on an ordinary insulator PbSe. Here, we report a combined scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) characterization of the cleaved surface of the parent compound $(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ (PSBS). Interestingly, the potential disorder due to the random distribution of native defects is only $\Gamma \sim 4~\mathrm{meV}$, comparable to the smallest reported for TIs. Performing high-resolution quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) near the Fermi energy ($E-E_\mathrm{F} = -1~\mathrm{eV}$ to $0.6~\mathrm{eV}$) we reconstruct the dispersion relation of the dominant spectral feature and our $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations show that this surface feature originates from two bands with Rashba-like splitting due to strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking. Moreover, a small hexagonal distortion of the calculated Fermi surface is seen in the full momentum space distribution of the measured scattering data. Interestingly, the scattering pattern at lower energies transforms into a flower-like shape with suppressed intensity along the $\overline{\Gamma K}$ direction. However, this effect is not due to the forbidden backscattering in the spin-momentum locked surface state in $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$ but reflects the threefold symmetry of the scattering potential.</description>

      <title>Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <title>The Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in strain-induced ferroelectric transition in SrTiO$_3$ membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical strain presents an effective control over symmetry-breaking phase transitions. In quantum paralelectric SrTiO3, strain can induce the ferroelectric transition via modification of local Ti potential landscape. However, brittle bulk materials can only withstand limited strain range (~0.1%). Taking advantage of nanoscopically-thin freestanding membranes, we demonstrated in-situ strain-induced reversible ferroelectric transition in a single freestanding SrTiO3 membranes. We measure the ferroelectric order by detecting the local anisotropy of the Ti 3d orbital using X-ray linear dichroism at the Ti-K pre-edge, while the strain is determined by X-ray diffraction. With reduced thickness, the SrTiO3 membranes remain elastic with &gt;1% tensile strain cycles. A robust displacive ferroelectricity appears beyond a temperature-dependent critical strain. Interestingly, we discover a crossover from a classical ferroelectric transition to a quantum regime at low temperatures, which enhances strain-induced ferroelectricity. Our results offer a new opportunities to strain engineer functional properties in low dimensional quantum materials and provide new insights into the role of the ferroelectric fluctuations in quantum paraelectric SrTiO3.</description>

      <title>Simulating Spin Dynamics of Supersolid States in a Quantum Ising Magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experimental study on the quantum Ising magnet $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$ that presented spectroscopic evidence of zero-field supersolidity (Chen et al., arXiv:2402.15869), we simulate the excitation spectrum of the corresponding microscopic $XXZ$ model for the compound, using the recently developed excitation ansatz for infinite projected entangled-pair states. We map out the ground state phase diagram and compute the dynamical spin structure factors across a range of magnetic field strengths, focusing especially on the two supersolid phases found near zero and saturation fields. Our simulated excitation spectra for the zero-field supersolid "Y" phase are in excellent agreement with the experimental data - recovering the low-energy branches and integer quantized excited energy levels $\omega_n=nJ_{zz}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the nonlocal multi-spin-flip features for modes at $\omega_2$, indicative of their multi-magnon nature. Additionally, we identify characteristics of the high-field supersolid "$\Psi$" phase in the simulated spectra, which should be compared with future experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the synthesis and properties of (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$, which is shown to be a $J_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{2}$ system made out of Ru$^{3+}$ moments in a honeycomb geometry. Bulk magnetization, heat capacity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) rule out the presence of static moments or any spin glass phase down to 500 mK. All techniques suggest a crossover to a liquid-like state below about 40 K. The $^{7}$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shift data suggest a non-zero $T$-independent spin susceptibility at low $T$. In zero field, $C_m/T$ shows $T^{-1}$ divergence which is consistent with vacancy-induced effects on low-energy excitations of the pristine Kitaev spin liquid. With field, power-law variations in the $^{7}$Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T$_{1}$ and magnetic heat capacity $C_{m}$ show quantitatively new scaling behaviors. A two-step entropy release in heat capacity is also observed putatively from $Z_{2}$ flux (low-$T$ step) and itinerant Majorana fermions (high-$T$ step). Based on these findings, we propose that (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ realizes a Kitaev spin liquid with no evidence of inherent magnetic ordering in zero field unlike $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ where approximately $8$ Tesla field is required to suppress magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall Effect of Magnons from Many-Body Skew Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of magnonic thermal Hall transport driven by many-body skew scattering. In field-polarized chiral magnets, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces three-magnon interactions that violate time-reversal symmetry and interfere with the four-magnon scattering, thereby breaking microscopic detailed balance and causing thermal Hall currents. This mechanism operates without disorder or Berry curvature and is intrinsic to interacting spin systems. We argue that it can be as significant as the band-geometric anomalous velocity, highlighting the importance of magnon interactions in thermal Hall physics.</description>

      <title>Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin-flop phases on the honeycomb lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kitaev magnets with bond-dependent interactions have garnered considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated by nonzero Chern number that can enhance the thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto, topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less studied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct in-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model, both of which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev interaction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively. We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction, topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.</description>

Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetric ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) magnets have garnered much attention due to their spin-charge coupled dynamics enriched by the parity-symmetry breaking. By real-time simulations, we study how localized spin dynamics can affect the nonlinear Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnets. To identify the leading-order term, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order optical response and classify the contributions by considering their transformation properties under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. Notably, our results reveal that the sizable contribution is attributed to the mixed dipole effect, which is analogous to the Berry curvature dipole term.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Fully-frustrated octahedral antiferromagnets: emergent complexity in external field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Octahedral antiferromagnets are distinguished by crystal lattices composed of octahedra of magnetic ions. In the fully frustrated case, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can be represented as a sum of squares of total spins for each octahedral block. We study the fully frustrated spin model for a lattice of edge-shared octahedra, which corresponds to the J1-J2 fcc antiferromagnet with J2/J1 = 1/2. The magnetization process at this strongly frustrated point features a remarkably rich sequence of different magnetic phases that include fractional plateaus at m = 1/3 and 2/3 values of the total magnetization. By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations we construct the H-T phase diagram of the classical model with eight field-induced states, which acquire stability via the order by disorder mechanism. These antiferromagnetic states have distinct spin configurations of their octahedral blocks. The same spin configurations are also relevant for the fully frustrated corner-shared model bringing an apparent similarity to their field-induced states.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquids in noise magnetormetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification of isolated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is a key step towards the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Here we show how the $T_1$-based noise magnetormetry of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit can reveal the unique signatures of Majorana fermions attached to vacancies in a non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL). The $1/T_1$ of the NV center is found to be increased significantly when the working frequency of the NV center matches the energy difference between a MZM and a low-energy hybridized mode involving dangling Majorana fermions adjacent to vacancies. In experiments, this energy difference can be tuned by an external Zeeman field. Because of the large excitation gap of flipping a local $Z_2$ gauge field, the $1/T_1$ spectrum is robust against other fluctuations in KQSLs. Our study presents a promising pathway for identifying the non-Abelian phase in Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical dynamics of N\'eel vector and magnetization accompanied by THz and high-harmonic radiation from ultrafast-light-driven NiO antiferromagnet insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast-light-driven strongly correlated antiferromagnetic insulators, such as prototypical NiO with large energy gap 4 eV, have recently attracted experimental attention using either above-gap [K. Gillmeister et al., Nat. Commun. 11, 4095 (2020)] or subgap [H. Qiu et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 388 (2021)] energy photons that are of fundamental interest in far-from-equilibrium quantum matter or spintronic applications, respectively. In the latter context, emission of THz radiation is also observed from NiO/Pt bilayers, where heavy metal (HM) Pt introduces strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, microscopic mechanisms of such emission remain obscure because spintronic THz emitters have been amply studied using FM/HM (FM-ferromagnetic metal of conventional type) bilayers, where ultrafast demagnetization takes place and is directly related to THz emission. Conversely, in NiO total magnetization is zero prior to the fs laser pulse (fsLP) application. Here we employ the two-orbital Hubbard-Hund-Heisenberg model and study, via numerically exact nonequilibrium quantum many-body methods, the dynamics of its Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization. Additionally, we compute electromagnetic radiation by both time-dependent magnetization and local charge currents arising in either plain NiO or NiO with proximity SOC introduced by HM layer. Our analysis reveals nonclassical dynamics of Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization, changing only in length while not rotating, where the former is substantially reduced only in the case above-gap fsLP. In the plain NiO case, THz radiation of interest to applications is insignificant, but adding SOC enhances both current and magnetic dipole contributions to it. Above THz range, we find integer high-harmonic generation, as well as unusual noninteger harmonics for above-gap fsLP pump.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility anisotropy and absence of ferroelectric order in the Kitaev spin liquid candidate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the magnetic, magnetodielectric, and electric polarization properties of single crystals of the Co-based Kitaev Spin Liquid (KSL) candidate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ (NCTO). The sample shows magnetic transitions at 26 K, 16 K, and 5 K, consistent with the literature. The magnetic measurements along and perpendicular to the Co-honeycomb planes show a strong anisotropy in susceptibility and in Curie-Weiss (C-W) temperatures. The experimental anisotropic C-W temperatures of NCTO qualitatively match with the theoretical C-W temperatures, calculated using the HKTF model [C. Kim \textit{et al.}, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter \textbf{34}, 045802 (2021)]. We find from our temperature- and field-dependent dielectric and pyroelectric ($I_p$) current studies ($H\parallel ab$ and $E\perp ab$) that our single crystal NCTO samples do not have a finite electric polarization below 100 K. These $I_p$ studies confirm the absence of a magnetoelectric coupling and electric polarization properties in the title compound and suggest that the zig-zag AFM structure is more favorable than the triple-$Q$ structure with AFM Kitaev interactions.</description>

Abstract: A deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying many-body quantum chaos is one of the big challenges in contemporary theoretical physics. We tackle this problem in the context of a set of perturbed quadratic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) Hamiltonians defined on graphs. This allows us to disentangle the geometrical properties of the underlying single-particle problem and the importance of the interaction terms, showing that the former is the dominant feature ensuring the single-particle to many-body chaotic transition. Our results are verified numerically with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, capable of extracting eigenvalues in a desired energy window of very large Hamiltonians. Our approach essentially provides a new way of viewing many-body chaos from a single-particle perspective.</description>

Abstract: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting nontrivial Euler class, a multigap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to dc conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multiband invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.</description>

Abstract: Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi et al., Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards its ground state. In this work, we develop a kinetic theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations for the examples of a 1d transverse-field Ising model, the transverse-field Ising model with an additional integrability-breaking field, and a non-integrable antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder. In all cases we are able to efficiently cool into the many-body ground state. The effects of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, are investigated through the lens of the kinetic theory: we show how the steady state quasiparticle populations depend on the noise rate, and we establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Unconventional p-wave and finite-momentum superconductivity induced by altermagnetism through the formation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnet is an exotic class of magnetic materials wherein the Fermi surface exhibits a momentum-dependent spin-splitting while maintaining a net zero magnetization. Previous studies have shown that this distinctive spin-splitting can induce chiral p-wave superconductors or Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting states carrying finite momentum. However, the underlying mechanisms of such unconventional superconductivities remain elusive. Here, we propose that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) through the exchange field can play a significant role in such phenomena. Through a systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with the d-wave spin-splitting induced by the exchange field, as observed in RuO2, we demonstrate that the formation of the BFS suppresses conventional spin-singlet superconducting states with s-wave characteristics. In contrast, the chiral p-wave state maintains a fully gapped spectrum without the Fermi surface, thereby becoming the ground state in the strong field regime. In the intermediate regime, we find that the FF state becomes the predominant state through the optimization of available channels for Cooper pairing. Moreover, we illustrate how the prevalence of the chiral p-wave and FF states over the s-wave state changes under the variation of the field strength or chemical potential. Our findings provide valuable insights into potential pathways for realizing sought-after topological p-wave superconductivity and finite momentum pairing facilitated by altermagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional $d$-wave ($j=2$) superconducting state may result from Cooper pairing in channels with different angular momenta and spin, such as $(l=0, s=2)$ or $(l=2, s=0)$. We consider spin-3/2 Luttinger fermions in the limit of small spin-orbit coupling parameter and with weak attractive interactions in both of these channels, and demonstrate that the stable $d$-wave superconducting phase of the system below critical temperature depends critically on the ratio of two interactions. When a weak inversion-breaking term in the kinetic energy is included, all three of the real, ferromagnetic, and cyclic phases can be realized within a narrow range around unit ratio. The result shows how models of multicomponent superconductors can be surprisingly sensitive to precise values of some of its parameters and display radically different superconducting ground states with their variation.</description>

      <title>Evolution and Instability of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces under Zeeman Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the evolution and instability of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) in the spherical $j=3/2$ model under a Zeeman field. The applied field induces a pronounced expansion in the BFS with $j_z = \pm 3/2$ component. Such behavior can be detected by spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Interestingly, the Pauli susceptibility exhibits behavior that appears discontinuous just below the transition temperature at zero field, even though it is a second-order transition. This is due to spontaneous magnetization. Furthermore, the analysis of the bogolon correlations in the superconducting phase suggests the possibility of the chiral $p$- or $f$-wave bogolon pairing instabilities rather than the Pomeranchuk instability. These chiral states coexist with the chiral $d$-wave superconducting state, spontaneously break inversion symmetry, and lead to the disappearance of the torus-shaped BFS structure.</description>

      <title>Fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with affine $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ algebra symmetry. Their bosonic modular-invariant partition functions have been fully classified based on the ADE classification. In this work, we extend the classification to include fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with the same affine symmetries, utilizing techniques of fermionization and parafermionization. We find that the fermionic and parafermionic $\widehat{su}(2)$ models are related to non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$ via the generalized Fr\"ohlich and deformation potential mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism behind electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that long-range electron-phonon interactions described by a generalized multi-phonon Fr\"ohlich mechanism result in phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broader range of materials.</description>
