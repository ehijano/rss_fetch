      <title>Analytical Approach to Wave Scattering in Waveguide Junction with Conducting Cylindrical Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach for analyzing waveguide junctions containing conductive cylindrical objects is proposed. The algorithm is based on mode matching technique using local projection functions, which improves the numerical conditioning of the problem. Moreover, the approach enhances computational efficiency by reducing the boundary where the numerical integration is required. Both convergence and accuracy of the method were tested by using several examples, including multi-section microwave filters, and validated through comparison with results obtained using the finite element method implemented in a commercial full-wave simulator.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models for Interpretable Credit Card Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms and payment solution providers face increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, ranging from identity theft and account takeovers to complex money laundering operations that exploit the speed and anonymity of digital transactions. However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.</description>

      <title>Development and Experimental Validation of Novel Evaluation Criteria for Turbulent Two-Phase VOF Simulations in High-Pressure Die Casting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air entrapment during mold filling critically affects porosity and overall casting quality in High Pressure Die Casting. This study assesses the feasibility of applying the vof method within OpenFOAM to simulate compressible, turbulent mold filling in a thin-walled geometry. Three-dimensional simulations with the "compressibleInterFoam" solver were carried out under ambient initial cavity conditions, using both laminar flow and the k-e turbulence model. The free surface dynamics were examined across a range of inlet velocities to evaluate their influence on interface morphology, cavity pressurization, and gas entrapment. To quantify these effects, three evaluation criteria were introduced: the TIFSA as a measure of oxidation risk, the TMVF as an indicator of filling continuity and air entrapment, and the TIVF as a proxy for surface loading. Results show that turbulence modeling accelerates pressurization and limits the persistence of entrapped gas, with velocity governing the balance between smooth filling, turbulent breakup, and exposure duration. Comparison with experimental casting trials, including CT based porosity analysis and photogrammetric surface evaluation, validated that the model captures key defect mechanisms and provides quantitative guidance for process optimization.</description>

      <title>Explicit Reward Mechanisms for Local Flexibility in Renewable Energy Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incentivizing flexible consumption of end-users is key to maximizing the value of local exchanges within Renewable Energy Communities. If centralized coordination for flexible resources planning raises concerns regarding data privacy and fair benefits distribution, state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., bi-level, ADMM) often face computational complexity and convexity challenges, limiting the precision of embedded flexible models. This work proposes an iterative resolution procedure to solve the decentralized flexibility planning with a central operator as a coordinator within a community. The community operator asks for upward or downward flexibility depending on the global needs, while members can individually react with an offer for flexible capacity. This approach ensures individual optimality while converging towards a global optimum, as validated on a 20-member domestic case study for which the gap in terms of collective bill is not more than 3.5% between the decentralized and centralized coordination schemes.</description>

      <title>pyCFS-data: Data Processing Framework in Python for openCFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many numerical simulation tools have been developed and are on the market, but there is still a strong need for appropriate tools capable of simulating multi-field problems, especially in aeroacoustics. Therefore, openCFS provides an open-source framework for implementing partial differential equations using the finite element method. Since 2000, the software has been developed continuously. The result is openCFS (before 2020, known as CFS++ Coupled Field Simulations written in C++). In this paper, we present pyCFS-data, a data processing framework written in Python to provide a flexible and easy-to-use toolbox to access and manipulate, pre- and postprocess data generated by or for usage with openCFS.</description>

      <title>D-Flow: Multi-modality Flow Matching for D-peptide Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in biological processes, with therapeutic peptides emerging as promising pharmaceutical agents. They allow for new possibilities to leverage target binding sites that were previously undruggable. Although deep learning has advanced peptide discovery, generating D-proteins composed of D-amino acids remains challenging because of the scarcity of natural examples. This paper proposes D-Flow, a full-atom flow-based framework for de novo D-peptide design. D-Flow is conditioned on receptor binding and utilizes a comprehensive representation of peptide structure, incorporating backbone frames, side-chain angles, and discrete amino acid types. A mirror-image algorithm is implemented to address the lack of training data for D-proteins, which convert the chirality of L-receptors. Furthermore, we enhance D-Flow's capacity by integrating large protein language models with structural awareness through a lightweight structural adapter. A two-stage training pipeline and a controlling toolkit also enable D-Flow to transition from a general protein design to a targeted binder design while preserving pre-training knowledge. Extensive experimental results on the PepMerge benchmark demonstrate D-Flow's effectiveness, particularly in developing peptides with entire D-residues. This approach represents a significant advancement in computational D-peptide design, offering unique opportunities for bioorthogonal and stable molecular tools and diagnostics. The code is available in https://github.com/smiles724/PeptideDesign.</description>

Abstract: Parametric surrogate models of electric machines are widely used for efficient design optimization and operational monitoring. Addressing geometry variations, spline-based computer-aided design representations play a pivotal role. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines isogeometric analysis, proper orthogonal decomposition and deep learning to enable rapid and physically consistent predictions by directly learning spline basis coefficients. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using a parametric nonlinear magnetostatic model of a permanent magnet synchronous machine.</description>

      <title>Utilising physics-guided deep learning to overcome data scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) relies heavily on data, and the quality of data influences its performance significantly. However, obtaining high-quality, well-annotated datasets can be challenging or even impossible in many real-world applications, such as structural risk estimation and medical diagnosis. This presents a significant barrier to the practical implementation of DL in these fields. Physics-guided deep learning (PGDL) is a novel type of DL that can integrate physics laws to train neural networks. This can be applied to any systems that are controlled or governed by physics laws, such as mechanics, finance and medical applications. It has been demonstrated that, with the additional information provided by physics laws, PGDL achieves great accuracy and generalisation in the presence of data scarcity. This review provides a detailed examination of PGDL and offers a structured overview of its use in addressing data scarcity across various fields, including physics, engineering and medical applications. Moreover, the review identifies the current limitations and opportunities for PGDL in relation to data scarcity and offers a thorough discussion on the future prospects of PGDL.</description>

      <title>KALE-LM-Chem: Vision and Practice Toward an AI Brain for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for enabling domain-specific intelligence. In this work, we present our vision for building an AI-powered chemical brain, which frames chemical intelligence around four core capabilities: information extraction, semantic parsing, knowledge-based QA, and reasoning &amp; planning. We argue that domain knowledge and logic are essential pillars for enabling such a system to assist and accelerate scientific discovery. To initiate this effort, we introduce our first generation of large language models for chemistry: KALE-LM-Chem and KALE-LM-Chem-1.5, which have achieved outstanding performance in tasks related to the field of chemistry. We hope that our work serves as a strong starting point, helping to realize more intelligent AI and promoting the advancement of human science and technology, as well as societal development.</description>

      <title>All That Glisters Is Not Gold: A Benchmark for Reference-Free Counterfactual Financial Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RFC Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on financial misinformation under realistic news. RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.</description>
