      <title>String-Membrane-Nets from Higher-Form Gauging: An Alternate Route to $p$-String Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new perspective on the $p$-string condensation procedure for constructing 3+1D fracton phases by implementing this process via the gauging of higher-form symmetries. Specifically, we show that gauging a 1-form symmetry in 3+1D that is generated by Abelian anyons in isotropic stacks of 2+1D topological orders naturally results in a 3+1D $p$-string condensed phase, providing a controlled non-perturbative construction that realizes fracton orders. This approach clarifies the symmetry principles underlying $p$-string condensation and generalizes the familiar connection between anyon condensation and one-form gauging in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate this correspondence explicitly in both field theories and lattice models: in field theory, we derive the foliated field theory description of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ X-Cube model by gauging a higher-form symmetry in stacks of 2+1D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories; on the lattice, we show how gauging a diagonal 1-form symmetry in isotropic stacks of $G$-graded string-net models leads to string-membrane-nets hosting restricted mobility excitations. This perspective naturally generalizes to spatial dimensions $d \geq 2$ and provides a step towards building an algebraic theory of $p$-string condensation.</description>

      <title>Hybridized and Localized 4f Electronic States of Nd-based Intermetallic Compounds in Cubic Symmetry Probed by High-Energy Photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopies on NdTi2Al20 and NdBe13 which show antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures. The Nd 3d core-level photoemission and Nd 3d-4f valence-band resonant photoemission spectra show finite 4f4 initial-state components in addition to the 4f3 configurations attributed to the c-f hybridization effects in NdTi2Al20, while the 4f3 initial-state components with localized character are dominant in NdBe13. These results imply the emergence of overscreening channel due to the two-channel Kondo effect in NdTi2Al20 through the the strong c-f hybridization effect.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals devices for surface-sensitive experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-operando characterization of van der Waals (vdW) devices using surface-sensitive methods provides critical insights into phase transitions and correlated electronic states. Yet, integrating vdW materials in functional devices while maintaining pristine surfaces is a key challenge for combined transport and surface-sensitive experiments. Conventional lithographic techniques introduce surface contamination, limiting the applicability of state-of-the-art spectroscopic probes. We present a stencil lithography-based approach for fabricating vdW devices, producing micron-scale electrical contacts, and exfoliation in ultra-high vacuum. The resist-free patterning method utilizes a shadow mask to define electrical contacts and yields thin flakes down to the single-layer regime via gold-assisted exfoliation. As a demonstration, we fabricate devices from 1$T-$TaS$_2$ flakes, achieving reliable contacts for application of electrical pulses and resistance measurements, as well as clean surfaces allowing for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The approach provides a platform for studying the electronic properties of vdW systems with surface-sensitive probes in well-defined device geometries.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic dependence of $T_c$ on the c axis compression in the HTSC cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the the $c$ axis compression on the electronic structure and superconducting properties of the HTSC cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ at different doping is investigated. The electronic structure of quasiparticle excitations is obtained within the effective five-band Hubbard model using the equation of motion method for Green's functions builded on the Hubbard operators. The superconducting gap and ${T_c}$ are calculated taking into account the exchange pairing mechanism involving not only the Zhang-Rice singlet but also excited two-hole triplet and singlet states. The energy of the $a_{1g}$ orbitals increases with increasing compression and the $a_{1g}$ quasiparticle bands begin to strongly interact with the $b_{1g}$ bands at the top of the valence band. The reconstruction of the region of states determining the superconducting properties results in the high density of states near the Fermi level. This mechanism leads to an increase in $T_c$ in the underdoped region with increasing compression. The pairing constants renormalizations under compression results in ${T_c}$ decreasing. The competition of these two effects leads to non-monotonic behavior of $T_c$ under the $c$-axis compression near optimal doping.</description>

      <title>Charge and magnetic orders in a two-band model with long-range interactions for infinite-layer nickelates NdNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective two-band model for infinite-layer nickelates NdNiO$_2$ that consisting of a $d$ band centered at Ni site and an interstitial $s$-like band centered at Nd site. To the large extent of the wave functions, we find intersite Coulomb interactions to be substantial. We then use the variational cluster approach together with mean-field theory to investigate magnetic and charge ordering. While tendencies towards charge modulation are found, they are weak and might be due to finite-size effects. Magnetic order is determined mostly by the filling of the $d$ band and hardly affected by including longer-ranged interactions. For a $d$-band density consistent with density-functional theory, magnetic ordering vanishes once quantum fluctuations are included to a sufficient spatial extent. Apart from self-doping, $d$ and $s$ bands remain largely uncoupled despite the presence of inter-orbital Coulomb interaction and (small) inter-orbital hopping.</description>

      <title>Localization versus hybridization of $f$ states in actinide and lanthanide dioxides probed in core-level photoemission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degrees of the localization and hybridization of the valence $f$ states/covalency of the chemical bonding in actinide and lanthanide dioxides were investigated using the atomic, crystal-field multiplet and Anderson impurity model (AIM) approaches to calculate actinide $5d$ and lanthanide $3d$ x-ray photoemission spectra (XPS). The actinide $5d$ XPS can be largely described within atomic, crystal-field multiplet theory due to an extended multiplet structure as a result of the strong interaction of $5f$ electrons with a $5d$ core hole. The multiplet structure was found to be quite sensitive to the oxidation state of actinides. In turn, the lanthanide $3d$ XPS description requires the AIM-type of calculations due to significant $4f-$O $2p$ hybridization effects. As a result derived from the analysis of the XPS spectra, an increase in the $f$-shell occupancy in the ground state due to the $f-$O $2p$ hybridization and covalency of the chemical bonding appears to be higher in lanthanide dioxides as compared to actinide dioxides.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. We address this challenge by introducing a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion as an efficient numerical approach to the DSF for arbitrary lattices. We focus on the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model and spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We present a user-friendly numerical implementation and provide comprehensive benchmarks on spin chains. As applications we treat a variety of frustrated two- and three dimensional antiferromagnets. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for a S=1 pyrochlore material.</description>

      <title>Magnetised Bounds for Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aspects of parity-preserving, three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with a global $U(1)$ symmetry in the presence of a background magnetic field are investigated. A local effective action is constructed to four-derivative order, based on an assumption that the magnetic field drives the theory into a gapped phase. This action is evaluated in a variety of backgrounds, and is used to obtain one- and two-point functions of the conserved current and stress-energy tensor. Dispersive arguments are developed and shown to impose powerful constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the effective action, leading to universal predictions for the CFT response at large magnetic field and the scaling dimensions of background monopole operators. These general results are further examined through explicit calculations in the free complex scalar, free Dirac fermion, and a holographic Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell model.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Driven Trimer Formation in Kagome Correlated Electron Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated electron materials with molecular orbital states extending over transition metal clusters can host multiferroicity, spin frustration, and unconventional insulating phases. However, the fundamental criteria that govern cluster formation and stability remain unclear. Here, we identify a symmetry, correlation, and electron filling driven criteria that stabilize triangular metal trimers in materials displaying transition metal kagome patterns. Using density functional theory and chemical bonding analysis, we show that trimer formation emerges when 6 to 8 electrons occupy molecular orbitals derived from transition metal d-states, achieving near complete filling of bonding states while avoiding antibonding occupation, and correlations are of intermediate strength. This principle explains the stability of Nb$_3$X$_8$ (X = Cl, Br, I), and more broadly, our findings offer a general design rule to obtain quantum materials with quantum states extended across transition metal clusters.</description>

      <title>Scalable alloy-based sputtering of high-conductivity PdCoO2 for advanced interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As integrated circuits continue to scale down, the search for new metals is becoming increasingly important due to the rising resistivity of traditional copper-based interconnects. A layered oxide PdCoO2 is one of the candidate materials for interconnects, having bulk ab-plane conductivity exceeding that of elemental Al. Despite its potential, wafer-scale vacuum deposition of PdCoO2, crucial for interconnect applications, has not yet been reported. In this study, we succeeded in the scalable growth of c-axis oriented PdCoO2 thin films via reactive sputtering from Pd-Co alloy targets. Our method paves the way to harness the unique properties of PdCoO2 in semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>On entanglement c-functions in confining gauge field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has proven to be a powerful tool for probing renormalization group (RG) flows in quantum field theories, with c-functions derived from it serving as candidate measures of the effective number of degrees of freedom. While the monotonicity of such c-functions is well established in many settings, notable exceptions occur in theories with a mass scale. In this work, we investigate entanglement c-functions in the context of holographic RG flows, with a particular focus on flows across dimensions induced by circle compactifications. We argue that in spacetime dimensions $d \geq 4$, standard constructions of c-functions, which rely on higher derivatives of the entanglement entropy of either a ball or a cylinder, generically lead to non-monotonic behavior. Working with known dual geometries, we argue that the non-monotonicity stems not from any pathology or curvature singularity, but from a transition in the holographic Ryu--Takayanagi surface. In compactifications from four to three dimensions, we propose a modified construction that restores monotonicity in the infrared, although a fully monotonic ultraviolet extension remains elusive. Furthermore, motivated by entanglement entropy inequalities, we conjecture a bound on the cylinder entanglement c-function, which holds in all our examples.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry probed using magnetotransport in epitaxial altermagnet MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials characterized by fully compensated spins arranged in alternating local structures, allowing for spin-split bands similar to those found in ferromagnets without net magnetism. Recently, MnTe has emerged as a prototypical altermagnetic material exhibiting spin-polarized electronic bands and anomalous transport phenomena. Although recent work has explored the magnetic and structural properties of MnTe, detailed experimental investigations into the relationship between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry are lacking. Here, we report the relationship between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry by investigating magnetotransport properties of MnTe epitaxial altermagnetic thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We observe a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect and show the control of Hall response with the altermagnetic order using the magnetic field and the crystallographic angle dependence. Detailed measurements establish that both the longitudinal and transverse electronic responses depend on the relative orientation of the applied current and N\'eel vector as well as on the crystal orientation and altermagnetic order. These results provide new insights into the interplay between crystal symmetry and altermagnetism for future device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum simulation experiments of the Kondo impurity problem using cold alkaline-earth(-like) atoms (AEAs) in a combination of optical lattice and optical tweezer potentials. Within an ab initio model for atomic interactions in the optical potentials, we analyze hallmark signatures of the Kondo effect in a variety of observables accessible in cold-atom quantum simulators. We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations--strongly suppressing Kondo physics. Crucially, we show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site. We identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.</description>

      <title>Human-machine collaboration: ordering mechanism of rank-2 spin liquid on breathing pyrochlore lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms thrive on large data sets of good quality. Here we show that they can also excel in a typical research setting with little data of limited quality, through an interplay of insights coming from machine, and human researchers. The question we address is the unsolved problem of ordering out of a spin-liquid phase described by an emergent rank-2 U(1) gauge theory, as described by [H. Yan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 127203 (2020)]. Published Monte Carlo simulations for this problem are consistent with a strong first-order phase transition, but were too noisy for the form of low-temperature order to be identified. Using a highly-interpretable machine learning approach based on a support vector machine with a tensorial kernel (TKSVM), we re-analyze this Monte Carlo data, gaining new information about the form of order that could in turn be interpreted by traditionally-trained physicists. We find that the low-temperature ordered phase is a form of magnetic order analogous to a smectic liquid crystal. This arises due to a subtle thermal order-by-disorder mechanism, that can be understood from the fluctuations of the tensor electric field of the parent rank-2 gauge theory. These results were obtained by a back-and-forth process which closely resembles a collaboration between human researchers and machines. We argue that this "collaborative" approach may provide a blueprint for solving other problems that have not yielded to human insights alone.</description>

      <title>A solvable embedding mechanism for one-dimensional spinless and Majorana fermions in higher-dimensional spin-1/2 magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We write down a class of two-dimensional quantum spin-1/2 Hamiltonians whose eigenspectra are exactly solvable via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The general structure corresponds to a suitable grid composed of XY or XX-Ising spin chains and ZZ-Ising spin chains and is generalizable to higher dimensions. They can host stacks of one-dimensional spinless fermion liquids with gapless excitations and power-law correlations coexisting with ordered spin moments (localized spinless fermions). Bond-dependent couplings thus can be an alternate mechanism than geometric frustration of SU(2)-symmetric couplings to obtain spinless fermionic excitations. Put in a different way, bond-dependent couplings allow for an embedding of one-dimensional spinless fermion (Tomonoga-Luttinger) liquids and solids and also Majorana excitations in higher dimensions. They can accommodate a simpler set of site-local conserved quantities apart from the more intricate, interlocked set of plaquette-local or bond-local conserved quantities in Kitaev's honeycomb model with Majorana excitations. The proposed grid structure may provide an architecture for quantum engineering with controllable qubits.</description>

      <title>Emergent inductors in non-helical magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergent inductor, which is a concept of an inductor employing quantum mechanics on helical magnets, has been studied actively from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Interestingly, finite inductance has been observed not only in spiral magnetic phases but also across various other magnetic phases although the underlying mechanism behind emergent inductance in non-helical magnets remains unresolved. In this study, we broaden the concept of emergent inductance to encompass non-helical magnets and establish a comprehensive formalism of the emergent inductance generated by magnetization dynamics. Using a diagrammatic approach, we derive the linear response of current density mediated by magnetization dynamics and formulate impedance and inductance for general magnetic materials. We reveal that the emergent inductance is composed of two distinct components, each contributing positively or negatively. Notably, the positive inductance arises from Ohmic dissipation including the effect of the emergent electric field (Berry phase in real space) while the negative inductance arises from the polarization of itinerant electrons (Berry curvature in $k$-$t$ space). We also apply the present method to quasi 1D models and show the numerical results of the inductance, the spin dynamics, the impedance, and the Q-value.</description>

Abstract: Wigner crystallization of free electrons at room temperature is explored for a new class of metallic ultrathin (transdimensional) materials whose properties can be controlled by their thickness. Our calculations of the critical electron density, temperature and the melting curve show that by reducing the material thickness one can Wigner-crystallize free electrons at room temperature to get them pinned onto a two-dimensional triangular lattice of a supersolid inside of the crystalline material. Such a solid melts and freezes reversibly with increase and decrease of electron doping or temperature, whereby its resistivity behaves opposite to the free electron gas model predictions.</description>

      <title>$3d$ flat bands and coupled $4f$ moments in the kagome-honeycomb permanent magnet Sm$_{2}$Co$_{17}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs) with both localized moments and itinerant conduction bands are not only important for fundamental research but also have significant technological applications. In particular, Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ is a prototypical high-temperture REPM, where the Co atoms form a kagome-honeycomb stacked lattice. Here we report synthesis of epitaxial Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy and measurements of their momentum-resolved electronic structure from \textit{in-situ} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results unveil two flat bands from Co $3d$ orbitals near the Fermi level ($E_F$), one at $\sim$\,--300\,meV and another right at $E_F$, which arise from orbital-selective destructive interference and strong electron correlations, respectively. In addition, our results reveal that Sm $4f$ states are far away from $E_F$ (hence mostly localized) and exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence, caused by the $3d$-$4f$ magnetic coupling. Our findings provide direct spectroscopic insights to understand the strong uniaxial ferromagnetism in Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ (and REPMs alike). Our work also opens avenues to explore flat-band physics near $E_F$ and emergent phenomena in correlated kagome-honeycomb lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the synthesis of single crystals of the kagome compound, UV$_6$Sn$_6$, and present the results of magnetization, electrical resistivity, heat capacity, x-ray, and neutron diffraction experiments to characterize the structure and magnetic properties. UV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in a large supercell of the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$ parent structure with an hexagonal symmetry in which some of the U atoms are shifted by $c/2$ in an ordered fashion. Below $T_{N1}\approx$ 29 K, an incommensurate magnetic structure with a temperature-dependent wave vector $(0,0,k_z)$ is observed. Below $T_{N2}=$ 23.5 K, the wave vector locks in to $(0,0,0.5)$, forming an antiferromagnetic ground state. The U moments align along the $c$ axis retaining a large magnetic anisotropy. These findings highlight the role of the $5f$ orbitals from uranium in this structural family in driving both magnetic ordering and structural modulation and distinguish UV$_6$Sn$_6$ from its lanthanide-based analogs.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the electronic states by quantum charge fluctuations in electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of electron-boson interactions is a key to understanding the mechanism of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates. While interactions with phonons and magnetic fluctuations are widely considered to mediate electron pairing in cuprates, the role of charge fluctuations, which is one of the fundamental degrees of freedom, remains unclear. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and angle-resolved inverse photoemission spectroscopy (AR-IPES) to investigate the electronic structure of the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively, in the electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. We found emergent spectral features in both the occupied (ARPES) and unoccupied states (AR-IPES), which are likely induced by charge fluctuations. The present study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the relationship between quantum charge fluctuations and superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.</description>

      <title>Chaotic percolation in the random geometry of maximum-density dimer packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum-density dimer packings (maximum matchings) of non-bipartite site-diluted lattices, such as the triangular and Shastry-Sutherland lattices in $d=2$ dimensions and the stacked-triangular and corner-sharing octahedral lattices in $d=3$, generically exhibit a nonzero density of monomers (unmatched vertices). Following a construction in the recent literature, we use the structure theory of Gallai and Edmonds to decompose the disordered lattice into ``${\mathcal R}$-type'' regions which host the monomers of any maximum matching, and perfectly matched ``${\mathcal P}$-type'' regions from which such monomers are excluded. When the density $n_v$ of quenched vacancies lies well within the low-$n_v$ geometrically percolated phase of the disordered lattice, we find that the random geometry of these regions exhibits unusual {\em Gallai-Edmonds percolation} phenomena. In $d=2$, we find two phases separated by a critical point, namely a phase in which all ${\mathcal R}$-type and ${\mathcal P}$-type regions are small, and a percolated phase that displays a striking lack of self-averaging in the thermodynamic limit: Each sample has a single percolating region which is of type ${\mathcal R}$ with probability $f_{\mathcal R}$ and type ${\mathcal P}$ with probability $1-f_{\mathcal R}$, where $f_{\mathcal R} \approx 0.50(2)$ is independent of $n_v$ (away from the critical region). In this regime, microscopic changes in the vacancy configuration lead to chaotic changes in the large-scale structure of ${\mathcal R}$-type and ${\mathcal P}$-type regions. In $d=3$, apart from a phase with small ${\mathcal R}$-type and ${\mathcal P}$-type regions, the thermodynamic limit exhibits {\em four} distinct percolated phases separated by critical points at successively lower $n_v$, two of which again display unusual violations of self-averaging. Physical consequences are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11170v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Here we show that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also demonstrate that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows control over the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of high electron-mobility, unpaired spins, and superconductivity at high carrier density SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $t_{2g}$ band-structure of SrTiO$_3$-based two-dimensional electron gasses (2DEGs), have been found to play a role in features such as the superconducting dome, high-mobility transport, and the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling. This adds to the already very diverse range of phenomena, including magnetism and extreme magnetoresistance, exhibited by this particular material platform. Tuning and/or combining these intriguing attributes could yield significant progress within quantum and spintronics technologies. Doing so demands precise control of the parameters, which requires a better understanding of the factors that affect them. Here we present effects of the $t_{2g}$ band-order inversion, stemming from the growth of spinel-structured $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ onto perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Electronic transport measurements show that with LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ as the reference, the carrier density and electron mobility are enhanced, and the sample displays a reshaping of the superconducting dome. Additionally, unpaired spins are evidenced by increasing Anomalous Hall Effect with decreasing temperature, entering the same temperature range as the superconducting transition, and a Kondo-like upturn in the sheet resistance. Finally, it is argued that the high-mobility $d_{xz/yz}$-band is more likely than the $d_{xy}$-band to host the supercurrent.</description>

      <title>Fully nonequilibrium Hall response from Berry curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In topological materials, Berry curvature leads to intrinsic Hall responses. Focusing on time-reversal symmetric systems with broken inversion symmetry, a spontaneoous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect is expected to develop under an applied electric field. Motivated by recent developments in Weyl-Kondo semimetals, here we advance a fully nonequilibrium (FNE) Hall response due to the Berry curvature. In particular, we show that, while the spontaneous Hall current is quadratic in the previously described regime of weak electric field, due to the contribution from the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, the FNE Hall response for non-perturbative electric fields is not controlled by the Berry curvature dipole. Remarkably, the FNE Hall response resembles what happens in systems that break the microscopic time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate the universality of these results by comparing them with their counterparts in systems with any higher-multipole of the Berry curvature. The implications of our results for the understanding of strongly correlated topological semimetals are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Multipole Skin Effects Challenge Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for a localization transition in disordered, non-reciprocal systems to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges cluster at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which charges localize at random positions. In the dynamics of entanglement, this coincides with an area to volume law transition. For systems without boundaries, the skin effect becomes a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If dipoles or higher multipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable to arbitrary disorder. Counterintuitively, the system is therefore always delocalized under periodic boundary conditions, regardless of disorder strength.</description>

      <title>A Strong-Coupling-Limit Study on the Pairing Mechanism in the Pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity near $80$ K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</description>

      <title>Shot-noise in strongly-correlated double quantum spin Hall edges</title>

Abstract: We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of "double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moir\'e twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two identical copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly-correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly-correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly-correlated edge also has a gap to single-electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly-correlated edge.</description>

      <title>$N$-ality symmetry and SPT phases in (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cross-layer composite spins in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure and possible routes to enhance its superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has been recently found to exhibit superconductivity in its high-pressure phase, similar to the previously discovered bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but with a notably lower transition temperature. To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</description>
