      <title>Unconventional magnetization in the multiphase superconductor PdBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductors have specific signatures in their magnetic properties, such as intrinsic magnetization at interfaces and around defects and fractional and multiquanta vortices, with much attention focused on heavy fermion and high-T_c superconductors. Here we report an observation of highly anomalous magnetization in a candidate topological superconductor beta-PdBi2, a layered material where hidden inversion symmetry breaking leads to spin polarization and spin-momentum locking of the electronic bands. We observe strictly linear, non-hysteretic dc magnetization, a transition to sharply reduced ac susceptibility vs the magnetic field H applied parallel to the ab plane, and a strong anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane H. Based on our earlier finding of a magnetic-field induced phase transition from s-wave to nodal p-wave superconductivity in the tunnelling spectra of PdBi2, we propose that this unusual behavior can be explained by a transition from a conventional vortex structure in low-H s-wave phase to a domain structure corresponding to spatial phase separation into superconducting (nodal p-wave) and normal domains, identifying new features of magnetization that can arise from the multiplicity of superconducting phases.</description>

      <title>Quantized resonant tunneling effect in Josephson junctions with ferromagnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in SF$_1$F$_2$S junctions, which consist of conventional s-wave superconductors (S) connected by two ferromagnets (F$_1$ and F$_2$). At low temperatures, the Josephson critical current displays periodic resonance peaks as exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, provided a potential barrier exists at the F$_1$/F$_2$ interface. These resonance peaks emerge under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)}d_{1(2)}=\left(n_{1(2)}+1/2\right)\pi$. Here, $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\hbar v_F)$ represents a center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$. This critical current feature arises from a resonant tunneling effect induced by spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis. At resonance, the Josephson current primarily originates from the first harmonic in both parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations, whereas the second harmonic becomes more significant in perpendicular configurations. In cases where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while maintaining it in the $\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved.</description>

      <title>Emergent superconductivity and non-reciprocal transport in a van der Waals Dirac semimetal/antiferromagnet heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate emergent superconductivity and non-reciprocal transport (magnetochiral anisotropy, superconducting diode effect) at the heterointerface of two non-superconducting van der Waals (vdW) materials, the Dirac semimetal ZrTe$_2$ and the antiferromagnetic iron chalcogenide FeTe, grown using molecular beam epitaxy. We show from electrical transport measurements that two dimensional (2D) superconductivity arises at the heterointerface below temperature $T \sim 12$~K. When capped with a 2D ferromagnet (CrTe$_2$), these heterostructures show a superconducting diode effect with efficiency of about 30\%. With strong spin-orbit coupling in ZrTe$_2$, these epitaxial heterostructures provide an attractive epitaxial vdW platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity in Dirac semimetals and for developing non-reciprocal devices for superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Phase Stiffness in $2$D $s$-wave Disordered Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of white-noise disorder on the local phase stiffness and thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor. Starting from a local attractive model and using path-integral formalism, we derive an effective action by decoupling the superconducting order parameter into amplitude and phase components in a gauge-invariant manner. Perturbative techniques are applied to the phase fluctuation sector to derive an effective phase-only XY model for disordered superconducting systems. Solving the saddle-point Green's function using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory, we calculate the distributions of nearest-neighbor couplings for various disorder strengths. A single-peak distribution is observed for low disorder strength, which becomes bimodal with one peak at negative couplings as the disorder strength increases. The local phase stiffness remains randomly distributed throughout the lattice and shows no correlation with pairing amplitudes. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness ($J_s$) is studied using Monte Carlo simulations. At strong disorder and low temperatures, $J_s$ increases with increasing temperature, exhibiting anomalous behavior that may indicate the onset of a glassy transition. Additionally, calculations of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter in this disorder regime suggest the emergence of a $phase$-$glass$ state at very low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Upper critical field and pairing symmetry of Ising superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that the measured critical field $H_c$ in various transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors is poorly understood, we reexamine its scaling behavior with temperature and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By computing the spin-susceptibility in a multipocket system, we find that segments of the Fermi Surface (FS) at which the SOC has nodal points can have a contribution orders of magnitude larger than the remaining FS, hence setting the $H_c$, assuming the presence of a conventional singlet superconducting order parameter. Nodal lines of an Ising SOC in the Brillouin zone are imposed by symmetry, so they cause such nodal points whenever they intersect an FS pocket, which is indeed the case in monolayer NbSe$_2$ and TaS$_2$, but not in gated MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$. Our analysis reinterprets existing measurements, concluding that a dominant singlet-order parameter on pockets with SOC nodes is consistent with the $H_c(T)$ data for all monolayer Ising superconductors, in contrast to previous contradictory pairing assumptions. Finally, we show that the theory is also consistent with data on homobilayer TMDs.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional non-van der Waals niobium nitride nanosheets with high-temperature two-gap superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of the superconductivity in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant attention due to their promising low-power applications and fundamental scientific interest. Here, we report some novel stable non-van der Waals Nb$_x$N$_{x+1}$ ($x$ = 1-4) monolayers derived from the NbN bulk exfoliated along the (001) plane, as identified through first-principles calculations. Among these monolayers, Nb$_2$N$_3$, which crystallizes in the $P \overline{6} m2$ symmetry, stands out with an exceptional superconducting transition temperature of 77.8 K, setting a new high-$T_c$ benchmark for two-dimensional transition metal nitrides and binary compounds. Our detailed analysis reveals that the strong superconductivity in Nb$_2$N$_3$ is driven by phonon modes dominated by N vibrations, with significant electron-phonon coupling contributions from N-$p$ and Nb-$d$ electronic states. Using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg framework, we further determine the two-gap nature of the superconductivity in the Nb$_2$N$_3$ monolayer, characterized by pronounced electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic energy gaps. These results advance our understanding of superconductivity in 2D transition metal nitride and highlight their potential for nanoscale superconducting applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-Exchange Induced Spillover on Poor Man's Majoranas in Minimal Kitaev Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "Poor Man's Majoranas" (PMMs) [Phys. Rev. B 86, 134528 (2012)] devoid of topological protection can "spill over" from one edge into another of the minimal Kitaev chain when perturbed electrostatically. As aftermath, this leads to a delocalized Majorana fermion (MF) at both the edges. Additionally, according to recent differential conductance measurements in a pair of superconducting and spinless quantum dots (QDs), such a PMM picture was brought to reality [Nature 614, 445 (2023) and Nature 630, 329 (2024)]. Based on this scenario, we propose the spillover of the PMM when its QD is exchange coupled to a quantum spin $S$. We show that if this QD is perturbed by the exchange coupling $J$, solely the half $2S+1$ $(2S+2)$ of the fine structure stays explicit for a fermionic (bosonic) $S.$ Concurrently, the other half squeezes itself as the delocalized MF zero-mode. Particularly, turning-off the superconductivity the multiplicity $2S+1$ holds regardless the spin statistics. Meanwhile, the PMM spillover induced by $J$ becomes a statistics dependent effect. Hence, our findings contribute to the comprehension of spin-phenomena interplay with superconductivity in minimal Kitaev chains, offering insights for future quantum computing devices hosting PMMs.</description>

      <title>Frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness and short-range magnetic order in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study doping and temperature dependencies of temporal and spatial spin stiffnesses of the Hubbard model within the mean field approach for incommensurate magnetic order. We show that the frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness is crucial to obtain small values of correlation length, comparable to those observed in cuprates. Using the obtained spin stiffnesses, we obtain the temperature and doping dependence of correlation length within the large-$N$ limit of the respective nonlinear sigma model. In agreement with the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ we obtain short range magnetic order with relatively small correlation length at $0.1 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.2$, and magnetically ordered ground state in the narrow doping region $0.05\lesssim x \lesssim 0.1$. The latter state may correspond to the spin-frosen state, observed in the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.</description>

      <title>Resonant switching current detector based on underdamped Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current-biased Josephson junctions can act as detectors of electromagnetic radiation. At optimal conditions, their sensitivity is limited by fluctuations causing stochastic switching from the superconducting to the resistive state. This work provides a quantitative description of a stochastic switching current detector, based on an underdamped Josephson junction. It is shown that activation of a Josephson plasma resonance can greatly enhance the detector responsivity in proportion to the quality factor of the junction. The ways of tuning the detector for achieving optimal operation are discussed. For realistic parameters of Nb/AlOx/Nb tunnel junctions, the sensitivity can reach $S\simeq 5\times10^{12}$ (V/W).</description>

      <title>Spontaneous supercurrents and vortex depinning in two-dimensional arrays of $\varphi_0$-junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional arrays of ballistic Josephson junctions are important as model systems for synthetic quantum materials. Here, we investigate arrays of multiterminal junctions which exhibit a phase difference $\varphi_0$ at zero current. When applying an in-plane magnetic field we observe nonreciprocal vortex depinning currents. We explain this effect in terms of a ratchet-like pinning potential, which is induced by spontaneous supercurrent loops. Supercurrent loops arise in multiterminal $\varphi_0$-junction arrays as a consequence of next-nearest neighbor Josephson coupling. Tuning the density of vortices to commensurate values of the frustration parameter results in an enhancement of the ratchet effect. In addition, we find a surprising sign reversal of the ratchet effect near frustration 1/3. Our work calls for the search for novel magnetic structures in artificial crystals in the absence of time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Magnetically-controlled Vortex Dynamics in a Ferromagnetic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of 25 K, uniquely exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ $\simeq$ $19$ K. The interplay leads to narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ we observe a pronounced peak in the creep activation energy, and magnetic force microscopy measurements reveal the presence of very closely-spaced ($w\ll \lambda$) vortex clusters. We attribute these observations to the formation of vortex polarons for which we present a theoretical description. In contrast, we link strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work suggests new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with important applications in high-current conductors.</description>

      <title>The electronic structure and disorder effect of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an essential step towards uncovering their superconducting mechanism. It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills flows for multilayered graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by M.Atiyah and R.Bott long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s. Our perspective gives a simple bound for magic angles: if the gauge field $A({\alpha})$ is such that the YM energy $\Vert F_{A({\alpha})} \Vert^2$ is smaller than that of $U(1)$ magnetic flux embedded into $SU(2)$, then $\alpha$ is not magic.</description>
