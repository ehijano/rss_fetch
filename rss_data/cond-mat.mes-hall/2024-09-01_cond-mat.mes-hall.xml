      <title>Ultrafast unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance driven by terahertz light field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrafast control of magnetisation states in magnetically ordered systems is a key technological challenge for developing memory devices operable at picosecond timescales or terahertz (THz) frequencies. Despite significant efforts in ultrafast magnetic switching, convenient ultrafast readout of magnetic states remains under investigation. Currently, many experiments exploit magneto-optical effects for detecting magnetisation states, necessitating laser sources and optical components. However, energy-efficient and cost-effective electrical detection is preferred for practical applications. Unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) was proposed as a simple two-terminal geometry for the electrical detection of the magnetisation state in magnetic heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that USMR is active at THz frequencies for picosecond time readouts, and can be initiated with light fields. We detect ultrafast USMR in various types of ferromagnet/heavy metal thin film heterostructures through THz second harmonic generation. Our studies, combined with temperature-dependent measurements of USMR, reveal a significant contribution from electron-magnon spin-flip scattering. This suggests possibilities for all-electrical detection of THz magnon modes.</description>

      <title>A Spintronic Nano-Antenna Activated by Spin Injection from a Three-Dimensional Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A charge current flowing through a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) can inject a spin current into a ferromagnet placed on the surface of the 3D-TI. Here, we report leveraging this mechanism to implement a nano-antenna that radiates an electromagnetic wave (1-10 GHz) into the surrounding medium efficiently despite being orders of magnitude smaller than the radiated free space wavelength. An alternating charge current of 1-10 GHz frequency is injected into a thin film of the 3D-TI Bi2Se3, resulting in the injection of an alternating spin current (of the same frequency) into a periodic array of cobalt nanomagnets deposited on the surface of the 3D-TI. This causes the magnetizations of the nanomagnets to oscillate in time and radiate electromagnetic waves in space, thereby implementing a nano-antenna. Because it is so much smaller than the free space wavelength, the nano-antenna is effectively a "point source" and yet it radiates anisotropically because of internal anisotropy. One can change the anisotropic radiation pattern by changing the direction of the injected alternating charge current, which implements beam steering. This would normally not have been possible in a conventional extreme sub-wavelength antenna.</description>

      <title>Dirac bilinears in condensed matter physics: Relativistic correction for observables and conjugate electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent developments in electron chirality, we reconsider some microscopic physical quantities that have been overlooked or have received little attention in condensed matter physics, based on the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac bilinears in relativistic quantum theory. We identify the expression of physical quantities defined by the four-component Dirac field in terms of the two-component Schr\"odinger field, which is usually used in condensed matter physics, and clarify its conjugate electromagnetic field. This consideration bridges the fields of condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and particle physics, and paves the way to electromagnetic control of matter. Our findings provide a means of {\it ab initio} quantification of material characters such as chirality and axiality that are unique to low-symmetry materials, and stimulate the systematic search for useful, new functionalities.</description>

      <title>Multi higher-order Dirac and Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in exploring higher-order topology and their semi-metallic counterparts, particularly in the context of Dirac and Weyl semimetals, termed as higher-order Dirac semimetal (HODSM) and higher-order Weyl semimetal (HOWSM). The HODSM phase exhibits hinge Fermi arcs (FAs) with a quantized higher-order topological invariant. Conversely, the HOWSM phase is a hybrid-order topological phase manifesting both surface and hinge FAs as a signature of first- and second-order topology and also possesses both first- and second-order topological invariants. In this work, we investigate a tight binding model for multi-HODSM (mHODSM) hosting multiple hinge FAs having a quantized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) greater than one. Furthermore, we obtain a multi-HOWSM (mHOWSM) phase from the mHODSM by applying an external magnetic field. The mHOWSM phase possesses both the Chern number and the QWN, featuring both surface and multiple hinge FAs. We study the spectral properties of the mHODSM and mHOWSM in different geometries. We also investigate the hinge FA-mediated transport in mHOWSM employing a two-terminal setup.</description>

      <title>Size dependence of biexciton binding energy in strained ZnTe/(Zn,Mg)Te nanowire quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanowire quantum dots, i.e., heterostructures consisting of an axial insertion of low bandgap semiconductor within large band gap semiconductor nanowire, attract interest due to their emerging applications in the field of quantum communication technology. Here, we report on the fabrication of ZnTe/(Zn,Mg)Te nanowire quantum dots by molecular beam epitaxy and on a detailed investigation of the optical emission from individual structures by means of a combined study involving cathodoluminescence and micro-photoluminescence. A distinct dependence of the biexciton binding energy, defined as the spectral distance between the exciton and biexciton emission lines on the length of ZnTe axial insertions, is observed. With increasing dot length, not only does the biexciton binding energy value decrease distinctly, but also its character changes from binding to antibinding. The explanation of this effect relies on the appearance of a piezoelectric field along the nanowire axis, leading to a pronounced separation of electrons and holes. The change from a bound to an unbound character of biexciton energy can be well reproduced by theoretical calculations, which indicate an important contribution of excited hole states to this effect in the case of relatively large quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian multiterminal phase-biased Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by multiple superconductors and discover the emergence of exceptional points entirely determined by the interplay of the distinct superconducting phases and non-Hermiticity due to normal reservoirs. In particular, in Josephson junctions with three and four superconductors, we find stable lines and surfaces of exceptional points protected by non-Hermitian topology and highly tuneable by the superconducting phases. We also discover that, in Josephson junctions formed by laterally coupled superconductors, exceptional points can result from hybridized Andreev bound states and lead to the enhancement of supercurrents controlled by dissipation. Our work unveils the potential of multi-terminal Josephson junctions for realizing higher dimensional topological non-Hermitian superconducting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Manipulation by magnetic frustration in ferrotoroidal spin chains via curvature and torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric effects in curvilinear nanomagnets can enable chiral, anisotropic and even magnetoelectric responses. Here, we study the effects of magnetic frustration in curvilinear (quasi-)1D magnets represented by spin chains arranged along closed space curves of constant torsion. Considering the cases of easy- and hard-axis anisotropy in ferro- and antiferromagnetic samples, we determine their ground states and analyze the related magnetoelectric multipoles. A constant torsion along the chain results in alternating regions of high and low curvature, facilitating the spin spiral state perturbed by the (anti)periodic boundary conditions on the magnetic order parameter. While easy-axis ferromagnetic chains develop a purely toroidal configuration with the magnetic toroidal moment oriented along the geometry symmetry axis, hard-axis antiferromagnetic chains support multiple magnetic toroidal domains. Our findings suggest that tailoring curvature and torsion of a spin chain enables a new physical mechanism for magnetic frustration, which can be observed in the inhomogeneity of the magnetic order parameter and in the local ferrotoroidic responses.</description>

      <title>Residual quantum coherent electron transport in doped graphene leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent low-temperature electron transport experiments in high-quality graphene rely on a technique of doped graphene leads, where the coupling between the graphene flake and its metallic contacts is increased by locally tuning graphene to high doping near the contacts. While this technique is widely used and has demonstrated its usefulness numerous times, little is known about the actual transport properties of the doped graphene leads. Here, we present an experiment probing those properties in the quantum Hall regime at low temperature and high magnetic field, showing that electronic phase coherence and transport chirality are preserved, despite the significant charge equilibration occurring at the edges of the leads. Our work yields a finer understanding of the properties of the doped graphene leads, allowing for improvements of the contact quality that can be applied to other two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>A Large-$N$ Approach to Magnetic Impurities in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin impurities coupled to superconductors are under intense investigation for their relevance to fundamental research as well as the prospects to engineer novel quantum phases of matter. Here we develop a large-$N$ mean-field theory of a strongly coupled spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity in a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. The approach is benchmarked against Wilson's numerical renormalization group (NRG). While the large-$N$ method is not applicable in the weak-coupling regime where the Kondo temperature $T_K$ is smaller than the superconducting gap $\Delta$, it performs very well in the strong coupling regime where $T_K \gtrsim \Delta$, thus allowing to obtain a reasonably accurate description of experimentally relevant quantities. The latter includes the energy of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov subgap states, their spectral weight, as well as the local density of continuum states. The method provides a reliable analytical tool that complements other perturbative and non-perturbative methods, and can be extended to more complex impurity models for which NRG may be not easily applicable.</description>

      <title>Self-locking in Collapsed Carbon Nanotube Stacks via Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-locking structures are often studied in macroscopic energy absorbers, but the concept of self-locking can also be effectively applied at the nanoscale. In particular, we can engineer self-locking mechanisms at the molecular level through careful shape selection or chemical functionalisation. The present work focuses on the use of collapsed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as self-locking elements. We start by inserting a thin CNT into each of the two lobes of a collapsed larger CNT. We aim to create a system that utilises the unique properties of CNTs to achieve stable configurations and enhanced energy absorption capabilities at the nanoscale. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanical properties of periodic systems realised with such units. This approach extends the application of self-locking mechanisms and opens up new possibilities for the development of advanced materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Donor-bound-exciton strain microscopy in silicon devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effects of stress on silicon donor bound exciton ($\mathrm{D^0X}$) transitions in bulk silicon and in microfabricated silicon devices. We first study $\mathrm{D^0X}$ transitions in an isotopically purified silicon-28 bulk doped sample under controlled uniaxial stress, confirming the validity of existing models in the low strain ($\lesssim 10^{-5}$) regime. We then demonstrate the localised photoconductive detection of a few thousand donors illuminated by a 1078 nm resonant laser with $4~\mathrm{\mu m}$ spot focused on a microfabricated device consisting of an implanted phosphorus layer between a pair of metallic contacts. We observe local variations in the strained exciton peak splitting from $10~\mathrm{\mu eV}$ to $200~\mathrm{\mu eV}$, and obtain scanning microscopy stress maps in good agreement with finite-element-model thermal stress simulations. Our results suggest a potential use of donor bound excitons for in-situ stress sensing, and demonstrate pathways for the miniaturisation of $\mathrm{D^0X}$ photoconductive detection.</description>

      <title>Signatures of topology in generic transport measurements for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the signatures of the topological properties of the bandstructures for nodal-point semimetals are embedded in the response coefficients, arising in two distinct experimental set-ups, by taking the Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetal as an example. The first scenario involves the computation of third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the charge/thermal current densities to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field/temperature gradient. On the premises that internode scatterings can be ignored, the relaxation-time approximation leads to a quantized value for the nonvanishing components of each of these nonlinear response tensors, characterizing a single untilted RSW node. Furthermore, the final expressions turn out to be insensitive to the specific values of the chemical potential and the temperature. The second scenario involves computing the magnetoelectric conductivity under the action of collinear electric ($\mathbf E$) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields, representing a planar Hall set-up. In particular, our focus is in bringing out the dependence of the linear-in-$|\mathbf B|$ parts of the conductivity tensor on the intrinsic topological properties of the bandstructure, which are nonvanishing only in the presence of a nonzero tilt in the energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the bulk polarization in extended and localized phases of a quasiperiodic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite size scaling of the bulk polarization in a quasiperiodic (Aubry-Andr\'{e}) model using the geometric analog of the Binder cumulant. As a proof of concept we show that the geometric Binder cumulant method described here can reproduce the known literature values for the flat and raised cosine distributions, which are the two distributions that occur in the delocalized phase. For the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model at half-filling the phase transition point is accurately reproduced. Not only is the correct size scaling exponent of the variance obtained in the extended and the localized phases, but the geometric Binder cumulant undergoes a sign change at the phase transition. We also calculate the state resolved Binder cumulant as a function of disorder strength to gain insight into the mechanism of the localization transition.</description>

      <title>Universal Stochastic Equations of Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.</description>

      <title>Significantly Enhanced Interfacial Thermal Transport between Single-layer Graphene and Water Through Basal-plane Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer between graphene and water is pivotal for various applications, including solarthermal vapor generation and the advanced manufacturing of graphene-based hierarchical structures in solution. In this study, we employ a deep-neural network potential derived from ab initio molecular dynamics to conduct extensive simulations of single-layer graphenewater systems with different levels of oxidation (carbon/oxygen ratio) of the graphene layer. Remarkably, our findings reveal a one-order-of-magnitude enhancement in heat transfer upon oxidizing graphene with hydroxyl or epoxide groups at the graphene surface, underscoring the significant tunability of heat transfer within this system. Given the same oxidation ratio, more dispersed locations of functional groups on graphene surface leads to faster heat dissipation to water.</description>

      <title>Exact scattering cross section for lattice-defect scattering of phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of structurally complex lattice defects, such as functional groups, embedded nanoparticles, and nanopillars, to generate phonon scattering is a popular approach in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications. However, the theoretical treatment of this scattering phenomenon remains a formidable challenge, especially with regards to the determination of the scattering cross sections and rates associated with such lattice defects. Using the extended Atomistic Green's Function (AGF) method, we describe how the numerically exact mode-resolved scattering cross section \sigma can be computed for a phonon scattered by a single lattice defect. We illustrate the generality and utility of the AGF-based treatment with two examples. In the first example, we treat the isotopic scattering of phonons in a harmonic chain of atoms . In the second example, we treat the more complex problem of phonon scattering in a carbon nanotube (CNT) containing an encapsulated C60 molecule which acts as a scatterer of the CNT phonons. The application of this method can enable a more precise characterization of lattice-defect scattering and result in the more controlled use of nanostructuring and lattice defects in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium regimes for quasiparticles in superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubits with gap asymmetry larger than their transition energy are less susceptible to quasiparticle decoherence as the quasiparticles are mostly trapped in the low-gap side of the junction. Because of this trapping, the gap asymmetry can contribute to maintaining the quasiparticles out of equilibrium. Here we address the temperature evolution of the quasiparticle densities in the two sides of the junction. We show that four qualitatively different regimes are possible with increasing temperature: i) nonequilibrium, ii) local quasiequilibrium, iii) global quasiequilibrium, and iv) full equilibrium. We identify shortcomings in assuming global quasiequilibrium when interpreting experimental data, highlighting how measurements in the presence of magnetic field can aid the accurate determination of the junction parameters, and hence the identification of the nonequilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamical Casimir effect and Unruh entanglement in waveguide QED with parametrically modulated coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically an array of two-level qubits moving relative to a one-dimensional waveguide. This motion can be implemented mechanically or simulated via the modulation of the couplings between the qubits and the waveguide. When the frequency of this motion approaches twice the qubit resonance frequency, it induces parametric generation of photons and excitation of the qubits. The proposed quantum optomechanical system offers a plethora of possibilities for exploring various quantum electrodynamics phenomena. However, their theoretical analysis is challenging due to the presence of quantum nonlinearity, a continuum of propagating photonic modes, and the excitation of strongly nonequilibrium qubit states, which make many conventional analytical tools inapplicable. To address these challenges, we develop a comprehensive general theoretical framework that incorporates both perturbative diagrammatic techniques and a rigorous master-equation approach. Our calculations reveal several intriguing effects, including the directional dynamical Casimir effect, where momenta of emitted photon pairs are correlated, and the waveguide-mediated collective Unruh effect, where motion drives the qubits to a nontrivial steady state that can be entangled and exhibit phase transitions. Additionally, we examine the radiation back-action on the qubit motion, which becomes particularly pronounced when subradiant modes in the qubit array are excited. The back-action can significantly alter the mechanical spectra, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid phonon-biphoton modes.</description>

      <title>Signatures of polarized chiral spin disproportionation in rare earth nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In rare earth nickelates (RENiO$_3$), electron-lattice coupling drives a concurrent metal-to-insulator and bond disproportionation phase transition whose microscopic origin has long been the subject of active debate. Of several proposed mechanisms, here we test the hypothesis that pairs of self-doped ligand holes spatially condense to provide local spin moments that are antiferromagnetically coupled to Ni spins. These singlet-like states provide a basis for long-range bond and spiral spin order. Using magnetic resonant X-ray scattering on NdNiO$_3$ thin films, we observe the chiral nature of the spin-disproportionated state, with spin spirals propagating along the crystallographic (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ direction. These spin spirals are found to preferentially couple to X-ray helicity, establishing the presence of a hitherto-unobserved macroscopic chirality. The presence of this chiral magnetic configuration suggests a potential multiferroic coupling between the noncollinear magnetic arrangement and improper ferroelectric behavior as observed in prior studies on NdNiO$_3$ (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ films and RENiO$_3$ single crystals. Experimentally constrained theoretical double-cluster calculations confirm the presence of an energetically stable spin-disproportionated state with Zhang-Rice singlet-like combinations of Ni and ligand moments.</description>

      <title>Band representation, band connectivity and irreducibility</title>

Abstract: The BR, formulated by Zak in the 80s, is widely used in studies of topological phase of material. EBR are considered the building block of TQC. However, there were debate on whether they admit split bands, or if they contain band invariant subspaces. This manuscript presents a clear definition of the basis and illustrate that the band transformation properties are dependent on the band connectivity. Two different Fourier transform conventions in defining the BR induced from the same set of localised Wannier functions are discussed and identified as related by a simple gauge transformation. The TB BR are used to derive the form of TB Hamiltonian using group theoretical technique. The transformation properties of EBR allow explicit decomposition in terms of irreps of space group, and use of projection operators in determining symmetry permitted band connectivity. It is shown that EBRs arising from Wyckoff positions with multiplicity can have multiple atomic limits and identifies explicitly what occurs at HSPs on the surface of BZ as what determines the band connectivity and the irreducible nature of the connected band. Such multiple configurations arise from multiple ways to block-diagonalising representation matrix at these HSPs. The symmetry permitted connectivity allows the existence of dynamic band invariant subspaces known as irreducible band representations. Such IBR, induced from Wannier functions centred on linear combination of orbits of Wyckoff positions, can also arise from interaction among composite EBRs. They are rooted in the permutation symmetry of crystallographic orbits of Wyckoff positions with multiplicity and can occur even if the parental EBR is classified as indecomposable. When symmetry permitted split EBR occurs, which does not correspond to division between connected IBRs, the topologies of the bands are potentially non-trivial on both sides of the gap.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Ising model in a triangular vortex lattice of quantum fluids of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortices are topologically distinctive objects appearing as phase twists in coherent fields of optical beams and Bose-Einstein condensates. Structured networks and artificial lattices of coupled vortices could offer a powerful platform to study and simulate interaction mechanisms between constituents of condensed matter systems, such as antiferromagnetic interactions, by replacement of spin angular momentum with orbital angular momentum. Here, we realize such a platform using a macroscopic quantum fluid of light based on exciton-polariton condensates. We imprint all-optical hexagonal lattice that results into a triangular vortex lattice, with each cell having a vortex of charge l = +-1. We reveal that pairs of coupled condensates spontaneously arrange their orbital angular momentum antiparallel, implying a form of artificial orbital "antiferromagnetism". We discover that correlation exists between the emergent vortex patterns in triangular condensate lattices and the low-energy solutions of the corresponding antiferromagnetic Ising system. Our study offers a path toward spontaneously ordered vortex arrays with nearly arbitrary configurations and controlled couplings.</description>

Abstract: We set up and parametrize a Hubbard model for interacting quantum dots in bilayer graphene and study double dots as the smallest multi-dot system. We demonstrate the tunability of the spin and valley multiplets, Hubbard parameters, and effective exchange interaction by electrostatic gate potentials and the magnetic field. Considering both the long- and short-range Coulomb interaction, we map out the various spin and valley multiplets and calculate their energy gaps for different dot sizes and inter-dot separations. For half-filling and large valley splittings, we derive and parametrize an effective Heisenberg model for the quantum dot spins.</description>

      <title>Mode-resolved micromagnetics study of parametric spin wave excitation in thin-film disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational study of the parametric excitation of spin waves in thin film disks with a mode-resolved approach. The method involves projecting out the time-dependent magnetization, computed using micromagnetics simulations, onto the spatial profile of the eigenmodes that are obtained from the linearization of the equations of motion. Unlike spectral analysis in the frequency domain, the projection allows for the analysis of transient mode dynamics under parametric excitation. We apply this method to parallel pumping of quantized spin wave modes in in-plane magnetized thin-film disks, where phenomena such as frequency pulling, mutual phase locking, and higher-order magnon scattering processes are identified.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dissipation at Conical Intersections of Quasienergies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of Floquet states in the vicinity of a conical intersection of quasienergies and work out the consequences of the underlying spatio-temporal symmetries for a driven two-level system coupled to an ohmic heat bath. We find that on manifolds with constant quasienergy splitting, the mean energies of the Floquet states are continuously interchanged. In the presence of dissipation, the parameter dependence of the stationary populations generally resembles that of the mean energies. In turn, the mean energies are an indicator for the qualitative behavior of the density operator in the long-time limit. A further consequence of the symmetries is that for specific driving parameters, the stationary state may be fully mixed even at arbitrarily low temperatures. For large driving frequencies, such states with maximal entropy are found in the whole vicinity of the intersection, which can be explained by a chirality emerging in this limit. Analytical results beyond a high-frequency approximation are illustrated by numerical data.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of spin-space groups: Towards a complete description of symmetries of magnetic orders</title>

Abstract: Symmetries of three-dimensional periodic scalar fields are described by 230 space groups (SGs). Symmetries of three-dimensional periodic (pseudo-) vector fields, however, are described by the spin-space groups (SSGs), which were initially used to describe the symmetries of magnetic orders. In SSGs, the real-space and spin degrees of freedom are unlocked in the sense that an operation could have different spacial and spin rotations. SSGs gives a complete symmetry description of magnetic structures, and have natural applications in the band theory of itinerary electrons in magnetically ordered systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. Altermagnetism, a concept raised recently that belongs to the symmetry-compensated collinear magnetic orders but has non-relativistic spin splitting, is well described by SSGs. Due to the vast number and complicated group structures, SSGs have not yet been systematically enumerated. In this work, we exhaust SSGs based on the invariant subgroups of SGs, with spin operations constructed from three-dimensional (3D) real representations of the quotient groups for the invariant subgroups. For collinear and coplanar magnetic orders, the spin operations can be reduced into lower dimensional real representations. As the number of SSGs is infinite, we only consider SSGs that describe magnetic unit cells up to 12 times crystal unit cells. We obtain 157,289 non-coplanar, 24,788 coplanar-non-collinear, and 1,421 collinear SSGs. The enumerated SSGs are stored in an online database at \url{https://cmpdc.iphy.ac.cn/ssg} with a user-friendly interface. We also develop an algorithm to identify SSG for realistic materials and find SSGs for 1,626 magnetic materials. Our results serve as a solid starting point for further studies of symmetry and topology in magnetically ordered materials.</description>

Abstract: Few-level systems coupled to thermal baths provide useful models for quantum thermodynamics and to understand the role of heat currents in quantum information settings. Useful operations such as cooling or thermal masers have been proposed in autonomous three-level systems. In this work, we propose the coherent coupling of two qutrits as a simultaneous refrigerator and heat pump of two reservoirs forming a system. This occurs thanks to the coupling to two other reservoirs which are out of equilibrium but do not inject heat in the system. We explore the thermodynamic performance of such operation and discuss whether it can be distinguished from the action of a Maxwell demon via measurements of current fluctuations limited to the working substance.</description>
