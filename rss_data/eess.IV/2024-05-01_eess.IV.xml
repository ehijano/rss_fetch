      <title>Remote Sensing Image Enhancement through Spatiotemporal Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of time-sequence satellite images is a powerful tool in remote sensing; it is used to explore the statics and dynamics of the surface of the earth. Usually, the quality of multitemporal images is influenced by metrological conditions, high reflectance of surfaces, illumination, and satellite sensor conditions. These negative influences may produce noises and different radiances and appearances between the images, which can affect the applications that process them. Thus, a spatiotemporal bilateral filter has been adopted in this research to enhance the quality of an image before using it in any application. The filter takes advantage of the temporal information provided by multi temporal images and attempts to reduce the differences between them to improve transfer learning used in classification. The classification method used here is support vector machine (SVM). Three experiments were conducted in this research, two were on Landsat 8 images with low-medium resolution, and the third on high-resolution images of Planet satellite. The newly developed filter proved that it can enhance the accuracy of classification using transfer learning by about 5%,15%, and 2% for the three experiments respectively.</description>

      <title>Decoding Radiologists' Intentions: A Novel System for Accurate Region Identification in Chest X-ray Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis, radiologists meticulously examine various regions, documenting their observations in reports. The prevalence of errors in CXR diagnoses, particularly among inexperienced radiologists and hospital residents, underscores the importance of understanding radiologists' intentions and the corresponding regions of interest. This understanding is crucial for correcting mistakes by guiding radiologists to the accurate regions of interest, especially in the diagnosis of chest radiograph abnormalities. In response to this imperative, we propose a novel system designed to identify the primary intentions articulated by radiologists in their reports and the corresponding regions of interest in CXR images. This system seeks to elucidate the visual context underlying radiologists' textual findings, with the potential to rectify errors made by less experienced practitioners and direct them to precise regions of interest. Importantly, the proposed system can be instrumental in providing constructive feedback to inexperienced radiologists or junior residents in the hospital, bridging the gap in face-to-face communication. The system represents a valuable tool for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and fostering continuous learning within the medical community.</description>

      <title>Distributed Stochastic Optimization of a Neural Representation Network for Time-Space Tomography Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4D time-space reconstruction of dynamic events or deforming objects using X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an extremely ill-posed inverse problem. Existing approaches assume that the object remains static for the duration of several tens or hundreds of X-ray projection measurement images (reconstruction of consecutive limited-angle CT scans). However, this is an unrealistic assumption for many in-situ experiments that causes spurious artifacts and inaccurate morphological reconstructions of the object. To solve this problem, we propose to perform a 4D time-space reconstruction using a distributed implicit neural representation (DINR) network that is trained using a novel distributed stochastic training algorithm. Our DINR network learns to reconstruct the object at its output by iterative optimization of its network parameters such that the measured projection images best match the output of the CT forward measurement model. We use a continuous time and space forward measurement model that is a function of the DINR outputs at a sparsely sampled set of continuous valued object coordinates. Unlike existing state-of-the-art neural representation architectures that forward and back propagate through dense voxel grids that sample the object's entire time-space coordinates, we only propagate through the DINR at a small subset of object coordinates in each iteration resulting in an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory and compute for training. DINR leverages distributed computation across several compute nodes and GPUs to produce high-fidelity 4D time-space reconstructions even for extremely large CT data sizes. We use both simulated parallel-beam and experimental cone-beam X-ray CT datasets to demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Mammogram Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality among women worldwide. Early detection and risk assessment play a crucial role in improving survival rates. Therefore, annual or biennial mammograms are often recommended for screening in high-risk groups. Mammograms are typically interpreted by expert radiologists based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), which provides a uniform way to describe findings and categorizes them to indicate the level of concern for breast cancer. Recently, machine learning (ML) and computational approaches have been developed to automate and improve the interpretation of mammograms. However, both BI-RADS and the ML-based methods focus on the analysis of data from the present and sometimes the most recent prior visit. While it is clear that temporal changes in image features of the longitudinal scans should carry value for quantifying breast cancer risk, no prior work has conducted a systematic study of this. In this paper, we extend a state-of-the-art ML model to ingest an arbitrary number of longitudinal mammograms and predict future breast cancer risk. On a large-scale dataset, we demonstrate that our model, LoMaR, achieves state-of-the-art performance when presented with only the present mammogram. Furthermore, we use LoMaR to characterize the predictive value of prior visits. Our results show that longer histories (e.g., up to four prior annual mammograms) can significantly boost the accuracy of predicting future breast cancer risk, particularly beyond the short-term. Our code and model weights are available at https://github.com/batuhankmkaraman/LoMaR.</description>

      <title>Advancing low-field MRI with a universal denoising imaging transformer: Towards fast and high-quality imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in low-field (LF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems present remarkable opportunities for affordable and widespread MRI access. A robust denoising method to overcome the intrinsic low signal-noise-ratio (SNR) barrier is critical to the success of LF MRI. However, current data-driven MRI denoising methods predominantly handle magnitude images and rely on customized models with constrained data diversity and quantity, which exhibit limited generalizability in clinical applications across diverse MRI systems, pulse sequences, and organs. In this study, we present ImT-MRD: a complex-valued imaging transformer trained on a vast number of clinical MRI scans aiming at universal MR denoising at LF systems. Compared with averaging multiple-repeated scans for higher image SNR, the model obtains better image quality from fewer repetitions, demonstrating its capability for accelerating scans under various clinical settings. Moreover, with its complex-valued image input, the model can denoise intermediate results before advanced post-processing and prepare high-quality data for further MRI research. By delivering universal and accurate denoising across clinical and research tasks, our model holds great promise to expedite the evolution of LF MRI for accessible and equal biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Global Search Optics: Automatically Exploring Optimal Solutions to Compact Computational Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popularity of mobile vision creates a demand for advanced compact computational imaging systems, which call for the development of both a lightweight optical system and an effective image reconstruction model. Recently, joint design pipelines come to the research forefront, where the two significant components are simultaneously optimized via data-driven learning to realize the optimal system design. However, the effectiveness of these designs largely depends on the initial setup of the optical system, complicated by a non-convex solution space that impedes reaching a globally optimal solution. In this work, we present Global Search Optics (GSO) to automatically design compact computational imaging systems through two parts: (i) Fused Optimization Method for Automatic Optical Design (OptiFusion), which searches for diverse initial optical systems under certain design specifications; and (ii) Efficient Physic-aware Joint Optimization (EPJO), which conducts parallel joint optimization of initial optical systems and image reconstruction networks with the consideration of physical constraints, culminating in the selection of the optimal solution. Extensive experimental results on the design of three-piece (3P) sphere computational imaging systems illustrate that the GSO serves as a transformative end-to-end lens design paradigm for superior global optimal structure searching ability, which provides compact computational imaging systems with higher imaging quality compared to traditional methods. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/wumengshenyou/GSO.</description>

      <title>SpecstatOR: Speckle statistics-based iOCT Segmentation Network for Ophthalmic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography (iOCT) image segmentation in ophthalmic surgery, leveraging statistical analysis of speckle patterns to incorporate statistical pathology-specific prior knowledge. Our findings indicate statistically different speckle patterns within the retina and between retinal layers and surgical tools, facilitating the segmentation of previously unseen data without the necessity for manual labeling. The research involves fitting various statistical distributions to iOCT data, enabling the differentiation of different ocular structures and surgical tools. The proposed segmentation model aims to refine the statistical findings based on prior tissue understanding to leverage statistical and biological knowledge. Incorporating statistical parameters, physical analysis of light-tissue interaction, and deep learning informed by biological structures enhance segmentation accuracy, offering potential benefits to real-time applications in ophthalmic surgical procedures. The study demonstrates the adaptability and precision of using Gamma distribution parameters and the derived binary maps as sole inputs for segmentation, notably enhancing the model's inference performance on unseen data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Deep Learning Model Explainability in Brain Tumor Datasets using Post-Heuristic Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of deep learning models in medical diagnosis has showcased considerable efficacy in recent years. Nevertheless, a notable limitation involves the inherent lack of explainability during decision-making processes. This study addresses such a constraint, by enhancing the interpretability robustness. The primary focus is directed towards refining the explanations generated by the LIME Library and LIME image explainer. This is achieved throuhg post-processing mechanisms, based on scenario-specific rules. Multiple experiments have been conducted using publicly accessible datasets related to brain tumor detection. Our proposed post-heuristic approach demonstrates significant advancements, yielding more robust and concrete results, in the context of medical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Automatic Cardiac Pathology Recognition in Echocardiography Images Using Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition and a Vision Transformer for Small Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart diseases are the main international cause of human defunction. According to the WHO, nearly 18 million people decease each year because of heart diseases. Also considering the increase of medical data, much pressure is put on the health industry to develop systems for early and accurate heart disease recognition. In this work, an automatic cardiac pathology recognition system based on a novel deep learning framework is proposed, which analyses in real-time echocardiography video sequences. The system works in two stages. The first one transforms the data included in a database of echocardiography sequences into a machine-learning-compatible collection of annotated images which can be used in the training stage of any kind of machine learning-based framework, and more specifically with deep learning. This includes the use of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) algorithm, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, for both data augmentation and feature extraction in the medical field. The second stage is focused on building and training a Vision Transformer (ViT), barely explored in the related literature. The ViT is adapted for an effective training from scratch, even with small datasets. The designed neural network analyses images from an echocardiography sequence to predict the heart state. The results obtained show the superiority of the proposed system and the efficacy of the HODMD algorithm, even outperforming pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are so far the method of choice in the literature.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Bone Metastasis Analysis: Current Advancements, Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely used in medicine, particularly in the analysis of medical imaging, which has been driven by advances in computer vision and deep learning methods. This is particularly important in overcoming the challenges posed by diseases such as Bone Metastases (BM), a common and complex malignancy of the bones. Indeed, there have been an increasing interest in developing Machine Learning (ML) techniques into oncologic imaging for BM analysis. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art and advancements for BM analysis using artificial intelligence, this review is conducted with the accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Firstly, this review highlights the clinical and oncologic perspectives of BM and the used medical imaging modalities, with discussing their advantages and limitations. Then the review focuses on modern approaches with considering the main BM analysis tasks, which includes: classification, detection and segmentation. The results analysis show that ML technologies can achieve promising performance for BM analysis and have significant potential to improve clinician efficiency and cope with time and cost limitations. Furthermore, there are requirements for further research to validate the clinical performance of ML tools and facilitate their integration into routine clinical practice.</description>

      <title>X-Diffusion: Generating Detailed 3D MRI Volumes From a Single Image Using Cross-Sectional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present X-Diffusion, a cross-sectional diffusion model tailored for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. X-Diffusion is capable of generating the entire MRI volume from just a single MRI slice or optionally from few multiple slices, setting new benchmarks in the precision of synthesized MRIs from extremely sparse observations. The uniqueness lies in the novel view-conditional training and inference of X-Diffusion on MRI volumes, allowing for generalized MRI learning. Our evaluations span both brain tumour MRIs from the BRATS dataset and full-body MRIs from the UK Biobank dataset. Utilizing the paired pre-registered Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and MRI modalities in the UK Biobank dataset, X-Diffusion is able to generate detailed 3D MRI volume from a single full-body DXA. Remarkably, the resultant MRIs not only stand out in precision on unseen examples (surpassing state-of-the-art results by large margins) but also flawlessly retain essential features of the original MRI, including tumour profiles, spine curvature, brain volume, and beyond. Furthermore, the trained X-Diffusion model on the MRI datasets attains a generalization capacity out-of-domain (e.g. generating knee MRIs even though it is trained on brains). The code is available on the project website https://emmanuelleb985.github.io/XDiffusion/ .</description>

      <title>Align-Free Multi-Plane Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-plane phase retrieval method provides a budget-friendly and effective way to perform phase imaging, yet it often encounters alignment challenges due to shifts along the optical axis in experiments. Traditional methods, such as employing beamsplitters instead of mechanical stage movements or adjusting focus using tunable light sources, add complexity to the setup required for multi-plane phase retrieval. Attempts to address these issues computationally face difficulties due to the variable impact of diffraction, which renders conventional homography techniques inadequate. In our research, we introduce a novel Adaptive Cascade Calibrated (ACC) strategy for multi-plane phase retrieval that overcomes misalignment issues. This technique detects feature points within the refocused sample space and calculates the transformation matrix for neighboring planes on-the-fly to digitally adjust measurements, facilitating alignment-free multi-plane phase retrieval. This approach not only avoids the need for complex and expensive optical hardware but also simplifies the imaging setup, reducing overall costs. The effectiveness of our method is validated through simulations and real-world optical experiments.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Convolutional Neural Network-Based Star Detection and Centroiding Method for CubeSat Star Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star trackers are one of the most accurate celestial sensors used for absolute attitude determination. The devices detect stars in captured images and accurately compute their projected centroids on an imaging focal plane with subpixel precision. Traditional algorithms for star detection and centroiding often rely on threshold adjustments for star pixel detection and pixel brightness weighting for centroid computation. However, challenges like high sensor noise and stray light can compromise algorithm performance. This article introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for star detection and centroiding, tailored to address the issues posed by noisy star tracker images in the presence of stray light and other artifacts. Trained using simulated star images overlayed with real sensor noise and stray light, the CNN produces both a binary segmentation map distinguishing star pixels from the background and a distance map indicating each pixel's proximity to the nearest star centroid. Leveraging this distance information alongside pixel coordinates transforms centroid calculations into a set of trilateration problems solvable via the least squares method. Our method employs efficient UNet variants for the underlying CNN architectures, and the variants' performances are evaluated. Comprehensive testing has been undertaken with synthetic image evaluations, hardware-in-the-loop assessments, and night sky tests. The tests consistently demonstrated that our method outperforms several existing algorithms in centroiding accuracy and exhibits superior resilience to high sensor noise and stray light interference. An additional benefit of our algorithms is that they can be executed in real-time on low-power edge AI processors.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Set of Parameters Based Depth-Dependent Distortion Model and Its Calibration Method for Stereo Vision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth position highly affects lens distortion, especially in close-range photography, which limits the measurement accuracy of existing stereo vision systems. Moreover, traditional depth-dependent distortion models and their calibration methods have remained complicated. In this work, we propose a minimal set of parameters based depth-dependent distortion model (MDM), which considers the radial and decentering distortions of the lens to improve the accuracy of stereo vision systems and simplify their calibration process. In addition, we present an easy and flexible calibration method for the MDM of stereo vision systems with a commonly used planar pattern, which requires cameras to observe the planar pattern in different orientations. The proposed technique is easy to use and flexible compared with classical calibration techniques for depth-dependent distortion models in which the lens must be perpendicular to the planar pattern. The experimental validation of the MDM and its calibration method showed that the MDM improved the calibration accuracy by 56.55% and 74.15% compared with the Li's distortion model and traditional Brown's distortion model. Besides, an iteration-based reconstruction method is proposed to iteratively estimate the depth information in the MDM during three-dimensional reconstruction. The results showed that the accuracy of the iteration-based reconstruction method was improved by 9.08% compared with that of the non-iteration reconstruction method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have significantly advanced image processing, with Pix2Pix being a notable framework for image-to-image translation. This paper explores a novel application of Pix2Pix to transform abstract map images into realistic ground truth images, addressing the scarcity of such images crucial for domains like urban planning and autonomous vehicle training. We detail the Pix2Pix model's utilization for generating high-fidelity datasets, supported by a dataset of paired map and aerial images, and enhanced by a tailored training regimen. The results demonstrate the model's capability to accurately render complex urban features, establishing its efficacy and potential for broad real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-world Video Face Restoration: A New Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) on images has significantly progressed over the last several years, while real-world video face restoration (VFR), which is more challenging for more complex face motions such as moving gaze directions and facial orientations involved, remains unsolved. Typical BFR methods are evaluated on privately synthesized datasets or self-collected real-world low-quality face images, which are limited in their coverage of real-world video frames. In this work, we introduced new real-world datasets named FOS with a taxonomy of "Full, Occluded, and Side" faces from mainly video frames to study the applicability of current methods on videos. Compared with existing test datasets, FOS datasets cover more diverse degradations and involve face samples from more complex scenarios, which helps to revisit current face restoration approaches more comprehensively. Given the established datasets, we benchmarked both the state-of-the-art BFR methods and the video super resolution (VSR) methods to comprehensively study current approaches, identifying their potential and limitations in VFR tasks. In addition, we studied the effectiveness of the commonly used image quality assessment (IQA) metrics and face IQA (FIQA) metrics by leveraging a subjective user study. With extensive experimental results and detailed analysis provided, we gained insights from the successes and failures of both current BFR and VSR methods. These results also pose challenges to current face restoration approaches, which we hope stimulate future advances in VFR research.</description>

      <title>Causal Perception Inspired Representation Learning for Trustworthy Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite great success in modeling visual perception, deep neural network based image quality assessment (IQA) still remains unreliable in real-world applications due to its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations and the inexplicit black-box structure. In this paper, we propose to build a trustworthy IQA model via Causal Perception inspired Representation Learning (CPRL), and a score reflection attack method for IQA model. More specifically, we assume that each image is composed of Causal Perception Representation (CPR) and non-causal perception representation (N-CPR). CPR serves as the causation of the subjective quality label, which is invariant to the imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Inversely, N-CPR presents spurious associations with the subjective quality label, which may significantly change with the adversarial perturbations. To extract the CPR from each input image, we develop a soft ranking based channel-wise activation function to mediate the causally sufficient (beneficial for high prediction accuracy) and necessary (beneficial for high robustness) deep features, and based on intervention employ minimax game to optimize. Experiments on four benchmark databases show that the proposed CPRL method outperforms many state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods and provides explicit model interpretation.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Constancy Constrained Single Opinion Score Calibration for Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a highly efficient method to estimate an image's mean opinion score (MOS) from a single opinion score (SOS). Assuming that each SOS is the observed sample of a normal distribution and the MOS is its unknown expectation, the MOS inference is formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem, where the perceptual correlation of pairwise images is considered in modeling the likelihood of SOS. More specifically, by means of the quality-aware representations learned from the self-supervised backbone, we introduce a learnable relative quality measure to predict the MOS difference between two images. Then, the current image's maximum likelihood estimation towards MOS is represented by the sum of another reference image's estimated MOS and their relative quality. Ideally, no matter which image is selected as the reference, the MOS of the current image should remain unchanged, which is termed perceptual cons tancy constrained calibration (PC3). Finally, we alternatively optimize the relative quality measure's parameter and the current image's estimated MOS via backpropagation and Newton's method respectively. Experiments show that the proposed method is efficient in calibrating the biased SOS and significantly improves IQA model learning when only SOSs are available.</description>

      <title>Seeing Through the Clouds: Cloud Gap Imputation with Prithvi Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filling cloudy pixels in multispectral satellite imagery is essential for accurate data analysis and downstream applications, especially for tasks which require time series data. To address this issue, we compare the performance of a foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model with a baseline Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) model for missing value imputation in time series of multispectral satellite imagery. We randomly mask time series of satellite images using real-world cloud masks and train each model to reconstruct the missing pixels. The ViT model is fine-tuned from a pretrained model, while the CGAN is trained from scratch. Using quantitative evaluation metrics such as structural similarity index and mean absolute error as well as qualitative visual analysis, we assess imputation accuracy and contextual preservation.</description>

      <title>Beyond MOS: Subjective Image Quality Score Preprocessing Method Based on Perceptual Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image quality assessment often relies on raw opinion scores provided by subjects in subjective experiments, which can be noisy and unreliable. To address this issue, postprocessing procedures such as ITU-R BT.500, ITU-T P.910, and ITU-T P.913 have been standardized to clean up the original opinion scores. These methods use annotator-based statistical priors, but they do not take into account extensive information about the image itself, which limits their performance in less annotated scenarios. Generally speaking, image quality datasets usually contain similar scenes or distortions, and it is inevitable for subjects to compare images to score a reasonable score when scoring. Therefore, In this paper, we proposed Subjective Image Quality Score Preprocessing Method perceptual similarity Subjective Preprocessing (PSP), which exploit the perceptual similarity between images to alleviate subjective bias in less annotated scenarios. Specifically, we model subjective scoring as a conditional probability model based on perceptual similarity with previously scored images, called subconscious reference scoring. The reference images are stored by a neighbor dictionary, which is obtained by a normalized vector dot-product based nearest neighbor search of the images' perceptual depth features. Then the preprocessed score is updated by the exponential moving average (EMA) of the subconscious reference scoring, called similarity regularized EMA. Our experiments on multiple datasets (LIVE, TID2013, CID2013) show that this method can effectively remove the bias of the subjective scores. Additionally, Experiments prove that the Preprocesed dataset can improve the performance of downstream IQA tasks very well.</description>

Abstract: Synthetic medical data generation has opened up new possibilities in the healthcare domain, offering a powerful tool for simulating clinical scenarios, enhancing diagnostic and treatment quality, gaining granular medical knowledge, and accelerating the development of unbiased algorithms. In this context, we present a novel approach called ViewXGen, designed to overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on general domain pipelines using only radiology reports to generate frontal-view chest X-rays. Our approach takes into consideration the diverse view positions found in the dataset, enabling the generation of chest X-rays with specific views, which marks a significant advancement in the field. To achieve this, we introduce a set of specially designed tokens for each view position, tailoring the generation process to the user's preferences. Furthermore, we leverage multi-view chest X-rays as input, incorporating valuable information from different views within the same study. This integration rectifies potential errors and contributes to faithfully capturing abnormal findings in chest X-ray generation. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted statistical analyses, evaluating its performance in a clinical efficacy metric on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Also, human evaluation demonstrates the remarkable capabilities of ViewXGen, particularly in producing realistic view-specific X-rays that closely resemble the original images.</description>

      <title>Double Binnable RGB, RGBW and LMS Color Filter Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New, high-resolution CMOS image sensors for mobile phones have moved beyond the single-binnable Quad Bayer and RGBW-Kodak patterns to the double binnable Hexadeca Bayer pattern featuring 4x4 tiles of like-colored pixels. Pixel binning enables high-speed, low-power readout in low-resolution modes and, more importantly, a reduction of read noise via floating diffusion binning.
  In this paper, we present the non-intuitive result that Nona and Hexadeca Bayer can be superior to Quad Bayer in demosaicking quality due to degeneracies in the latter's spectrum. However, Hexadeca Bayer suffers from the weakness of generating Quad Bayer after on round of binning.
  We introduce novel double binnable RGBW and LMS CFAs, composed of 2x2 tiles capable of 4:1 floating diffusion binning, that are free from spectral degeneracies and thus demosaic well in full resolution and both binned modes. RGBW offers a 6 dB low-light, read noise-limited, SNR advantage over Quad and Hexadeca Bayer in all resolution modes, while for LMS, the corresponding advantage is 4.2 dB.</description>

      <title>Computer Vision for Increased Operative Efficiency via Identification of Instruments in the Neurosurgical Operating Room: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>

Abstract: Objectives Computer vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand images and videos. CV has the potential to be of assistance in the operating room (OR) to track surgical instruments. We built a CV algorithm for identifying surgical instruments in the neurosurgical operating room as a potential solution for surgical instrument tracking and management to decrease surgical waste and opening of unnecessary tools. Methods We collected 1660 images of 27 commonly used neurosurgical instruments. Images were labeled using the VGG Image Annotator and split into 80% training and 20% testing sets in order to train a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network using 5-fold cross validation. Results Our U-Net achieved a tool identification accuracy of 80-100% when distinguishing 25 classes of instruments, with 19/25 classes having accuracy over 90%. The model performance was not adequate for sub classifying Adson, Gerald, and Debakey forceps, which had accuracies of 60-80%. Conclusions We demonstrated the viability of using machine learning to accurately identify surgical instruments. Instrument identification could help optimize surgical tray packing, decrease tool usage and waste, decrease incidence of instrument misplacement events, and assist in timing of routine instrument maintenance. More training data will be needed to increase accuracy across all surgical instruments that would appear in a neurosurgical operating room. Such technology has the potential to be used as a method to be used for proving what tools are truly needed in each type of operation allowing surgeons across the world to do more with less.</description>

Abstract: In the era of digital medicine, medical imaging serves as a widespread technique for early disease detection, with a substantial volume of images being generated and stored daily in electronic patient records. X-ray angiography imaging is a standard and one of the most common methods for rapidly diagnosing coronary artery diseases. The notable achievements of recent deep learning algorithms align with the increased use of electronic health records and diagnostic imaging. Deep neural networks, leveraging abundant data, advanced algorithms, and powerful computational capabilities, prove highly effective in the analysis and interpretation of images. In this context, Object detection methods have become a promising approach, particularly through convolutional neural networks (CNN), streamlining medical image analysis by eliminating manual feature extraction. This allows for direct feature extraction from images, ensuring high accuracy in results. Therefore, in our paper, we utilized the object detection method on X-ray angiography images to precisely identify the location of coronary artery stenosis. As a result, this model enables automatic and real-time detection of stenosis locations, assisting in the crucial and sensitive decision-making process for healthcare professionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved prestigious performance for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction, enabling fast imaging for many clinical applications. Previous methods employ convolutional networks to learn the image prior as the regularization term. In quantitative MRI, the physical model of nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry is known, providing additional prior knowledge for image reconstruction. However, traditional reconstruction networks are limited to learning the spatial domain prior knowledge, ignoring the relaxometry prior. Therefore, we propose a relaxometry-guided quantitative MRI reconstruction framework to learn the spatial prior from data and the relaxometry prior from MRI physics. Additionally, we also evaluated the performance of two popular reconstruction backbones, namely, recurrent variational networks (RVN) and variational networks (VN) with U- Net. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves highly promising results in quantitative MRI reconstruction.</description>

      <title>ProgDTD: Progressive Learned Image Compression with Double-Tail-Drop Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progressive compression allows images to start loading as low-resolution versions, becoming clearer as more data is received. This increases user experience when, for example, network connections are slow. Today, most approaches for image compression, both classical and learned ones, are designed to be non-progressive. This paper introduces ProgDTD, a training method that transforms learned, non-progressive image compression approaches into progressive ones. The design of ProgDTD is based on the observation that the information stored within the bottleneck of a compression model commonly varies in importance. To create a progressive compression model, ProgDTD modifies the training steps to enforce the model to store the data in the bottleneck sorted by priority. We achieve progressive compression by transmitting the data in order of its sorted index. ProgDTD is designed for CNN-based learned image compression models, does not need additional parameters, and has a customizable range of progressiveness. For evaluation, we apply ProgDTDto the hyperprior model, one of the most common structures in learned image compression. Our experimental results show that ProgDTD performs comparably to its non-progressive counterparts and other state-of-the-art progressive models in terms of MS-SSIM and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Conditioning Generative Latent Optimization for Sparse-View CT Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a prominent example of Imaging Inverse Problem highlighting the unrivaled performances of data-driven methods in degraded measurements setups like sparse X-ray projections. Although a significant proportion of deep learning approaches benefit from large supervised datasets, they cannot generalize to new experimental setups. In contrast, fully unsupervised techniques, most notably using score-based generative models, have recently demonstrated similar or better performances compared to supervised approaches while being flexible at test time. However, their use cases are limited as they need considerable amounts of training data to have good generalization properties. Another unsupervised approach taking advantage of the implicit natural bias of deep convolutional networks, Deep Image Prior, has recently been adapted to solve sparse CT by reparameterizing the reconstruction problem. Although this methodology does not require any training dataset, it enforces a weaker prior on the reconstructions when compared to data-driven methods. To fill the gap between these two strategies, we propose an unsupervised conditional approach to the Generative Latent Optimization framework (cGLO). Similarly to DIP, without any training dataset, cGLO benefits from the structural bias of a decoder network. However, the prior is further reinforced as the effect of a likelihood objective shared between multiple slices being reconstructed simultaneously through the same decoder network. In addition, the parameters of the decoder may be initialized on an unsupervised, and eventually very small, training dataset to enhance the reconstruction. The resulting approach is tested on full-dose sparse-view CT using multiple training dataset sizes and varying numbers of viewing angles.</description>

      <title>The Machine Vision Iceberg Explained: Advancing Dynamic Testing by Considering Holistic Environmental Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Vision (MV) is essential for solving driving automation. This paper examines potential shortcomings in current MV testing strategies for highly automated driving (HAD) systems. We argue for a more comprehensive understanding of the performance factors that must be considered during the MV evaluation process, noting that neglecting these factors can lead to significant risks. This is not only relevant to MV component testing, but also to integration testing. To illustrate this point, we draw an analogy to a ship navigating towards an iceberg to show potential hidden challenges in current MV testing strategies. The main contribution is a novel framework for black-box testing which observes environmental relations. This means it is designed to enhance MV assessments by considering the attributes and surroundings of relevant individual objects. The framework provides the identification of seven general concerns about the object recognition of MV, which are not addressed adequately in established test processes. To detect these deficits based on their performance factors, we propose the use of a taxonomy called "granularity orders" along with a graphical representation. This allows an identification of MV uncertainties across a range of driving scenarios. This approach aims to advance the precision, efficiency, and completeness of testing procedures for MV.</description>
