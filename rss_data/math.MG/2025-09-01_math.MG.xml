      <title>Gromov hyperbolicity II: Dimension-free inner uniform estimates for quasigeodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second article of a series of our recent works, addressing an open question of Bonk-Heinonen-Koskela [3], to study the relationship between (inner) uniformality and Gromov hyperbolicity in infinite dimensional spaces. Our main focus of this paper is to establish a dimension-free inner uniform estimate for quasigeodesics.
  More precisely, we prove that a $c_0$-quasigeodesic in a $\delta$-Gromov hyperbolic $c$-John domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is $b$-inner uniform, for some constant $b$ depending only on $c_0$, $\delta$ and $c$, but not on the dimension $n$. The proof relies crucially on the techniques introduced by Guo-Huang-Wang in their recent work [arXiv:2502.02930, 2025]. In particular, we actually show that the above result holds in general Banach spaces, which answers affirmatively an open question of J. V\"ais\"al\"a in [Analysis, 2004] and partially addresses the open question of Bonk-Heinonen-Koskela in [Asterisque, 2001]. As a byproduct of our main result, we obtain that a $c_0$-quasigeodesic in a $\delta$-Gromov hyperbolic $c$-John domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a $b$-cone arc with a dimension-free constant $b=b(c_0,\delta,c)$. This resolves an open problem of J. Heinonen in [Rev. Math. Iberoam., 1989].</description>

      <title>On rectifiability of Delone sets in intermediate regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we deal with Delone sets and their rectifiability under different classes of regularity. By pursuing techniques developed by Rivi\`ere and Ye, and Aliste-Prieto, Coronel and Gambaudo, we give sufficient conditions for a specific Delone set to be equivalent to the standard lattice by bijections having regularity in between bi-Lipschitz and bi-H\"older-homogeneous. From this criterion, we extend a result of McMullen by showing that, for any dimension $d\geq 1$, there exists a threshold of moduli of continuity $\mathcal{M}_d$, including the class of the H\"{o}lder ones, such that for every $\omega\in\mathcal{M}_d$, any two Delone sets within a certain class in $\mathbb{R}^d$ cannot be distinguished under bi-$\omega$-equivalence. Also, we extend a result due to Aliste, Coronel, and Gambaudo, which establishes that every linearly repetitive Delone set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is rectifiable by extending it to a broader class of repetitive behaviors. Moreover, we show that for the modulus of continuity $\omega(t)=t(\log(1/t))^{1/d}$, every $\omega$-repetitive Delone set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is equivalent to the standard lattice by a bi-$\omega$-homogeneous map. Finally, we address a problem of continuous nature related to the previous ones about finding solutions to the prescribed volume form equation in intermediate regularity, thereby extending the results of Rivi\`ere and Ye.</description>

      <title>Geodesic complexity of the octahedron, and an algorithm for cut loci on convex polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geodesic complexity of a length space $X$ quantifies the required number of case distinctions to continuously choose a shortest path connecting any given start and end point. We prove a local lower bound for the geodesic complexity of $X$ obtained by embedding simplices into $X\times X$. We additionally create and prove correctness of an algorithm to find cut loci on surfaces of convex polyhedra, as the structure of a space's cut loci is related to its geodesic complexity. We use these techniques to prove the geodesic complexity of the octahedron is four. Our method is inspired by earlier work of Recio-Mitter and Davis, and thus recovers their results on the geodesic complexity of the $n$-torus and the tetrahedron, respectively.</description>

      <title>Geometric inequalities, stability results and Kendall's problem in spherical space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.06522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Euclidean space, the asymptotic shape of large cells in various types of Poisson driven random tessellations has been the subject of a famous conjecture due to David Kendall. Since shape is a geometric concept and large cells are identified by means of geometric size functionals, the resolution of the conjecture is inevitably connected with geometric inequalities of isoperimetric type and their improvements in the form of geometric stability results, relating geometric size functionals and hitting functionals. The latter are deterministic characteristics of the underlying random tessellation. The current work explores specific and typical cells of random tessellations in spherical space. A key ingredient of our approach are new geometric inequalities and quantitative strengthenings in terms of stability results for quite general and some specific size and hitting functionals of spherically convex bodies. As a consequence we obtain probabilistic deviation inequalities and asymptotic distributions of quite general size functionals. In contrast to the Euclidean setting, where the asymptotic regime concerns large size, in the spherical framework the asymptotic analysis is concerned with high intensities.</description>

      <title>Short proofs of Tverberg-type theorems for cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present short proofs of Tverberg-type theorems for cell complexes by S. Hasui, D. Kishimoto, M. Takeda, and M. Tsutaya. One of them states that for any prime power $r$, any complex $X$ topologically homeomorphic to $S^{(d+1)(r-1)-1}$, and any continuous map $f:X\to\mathbb R^d$ there are pairwise disjoint faces $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_r$ of $X$ such that $f(\sigma_1)\cap\ldots f(\sigma_r)\ne\emptyset$.</description>

      <title>From disc patterns in the plane to character varieties of knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an experimental study of groups generated by reflections in planar patterns of tangent circles, we describe some methods for constructing and studying representation spaces of holonomy groups of infinite volume hyperbolic $3$-manifolds that arise from unknotting tunnels of links. We include full descriptions of our computational methods, which were guided by simplicity and generality rather than by being particularly efficient in special cases. This makes them easy for non-experts to understand and implement to produce visualisations that can suggest conjectures and support algebraic calculations in the character variety. Throughout, we have tried to make the exposition clear and understandable for graduate students in geometric topology and related fields.</description>
