      <title>Ferroelastic Altermagnetism</title>

Abstract: Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Decoding Breast Cancer in X-ray Mammograms: A Multi-Parameter Approach Using Fractals, Multifractals, and Structural Disorder Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explored the fractal and multifractal characteristics of breast mammogram micrographs to identify quantitative biomarkers associated with breast cancer progression. In addition to conventional fractal and multifractal analyses, we employed a recently developed fractal-functional distribution method, which transforms fractal measures into Gaussian distributions for more robust statistical interpretation. Given the sparsity of mammogram intensity data, we also analyzed how variations in intensity thresholds, used for binary transformations of the fractal dimension, follow unique trajectories that may serve as novel indicators of disease progression. Our findings demonstrate that fractal, multifractal, and fractal-functional parameters effectively differentiate between benign and cancerous tissue. Furthermore, the threshold-dependent behavior of intensity-based fractal measures presents distinct patterns in cancer cases. To complement these analyses, we applied the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) light localization technique to quantify structural disorder at the microscopic level. This multi-parametric approach, integrating spatial complexity and structural disorder metrics, offers a promising framework for enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection.</description>

      <title>Realizing Bloch Dynamics in a Low-Cost Electrically Driven Acoustic Two-Level System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike classical bits that can only occupy one of two discrete states, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in arbitrary coherent superpositions of the ground and excited states. This fundamental distinction grants qubits enhanced capabilities for information storage and processing. The Bloch sphere provides an intuitive and powerful geometric framework for visualizing, characterizing, and controlling the dynamical evolution of a qubit under external driving fields. By mapping the state evolution onto the Bloch sphere, processes such as spin flips and phase accumulation can be vividly represented as trajectories, enabling direct insight into coherent control mechanisms. Here, we implement Bloch dynamics in a classical platform by constructing a tunable acoustic two-level system based on high-quality-factor electro-acoustic coupled cavities. Using programmable spatiotemporal external field modulation, we demonstrate full Bloch sphere control through classical analogs of quantum phenomena, including Rabi oscillations, Floquet dynamics, Ramsey interference, and spin echo sequences. Our results bridge coherent Bloch dynamics with classical wave control, revealing a versatile experimental platform for exploring quantum-inspired physics. Furthermore, the system exhibits exceptional capabilities for precision transient acoustic field shaping, enabled by high-fidelity pulse-driven modulation.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Broadband plug-and-play photonic circuit packaging with sub-dB loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) offer transformative potential for computing systems, enabling high-bandwidth neuromorphic processors and facilitating low decoherence quantum computing on a chip scale platform. However, the development of robust and scalable optical packaging solutions remains a major challenge. Efficient fiber-to-chip coupling is essential for minimizing loss and enabling high optical bandwidth, key requirements for photonic computing. Here, we introduce a novel plug-and-play solution for fiber-to-PIC connections using female multi-fiber termination push-on cables and additively fabricate the alignment counterpart on the circuit via two-photon polymerization. We develop 3D out-of-plane couplers, offering a peak transmission of -0.41 dB and broadband performance with losses below 0.55 dB across the 1500-1600 nm range. Integration of the couplers with the plug-and-play solution adds in average only 0.37+-0.12 dB of loss, setting a record in passive out-of-plane packaging solution with losses of 0.78 dB, as well as -0.5 dB bandwidth greater than 100 nm. We characterize the reproducibility of this out-of-plane packaging solution in terms of losses, as well as bandwidth by interfacing a 17-port photonic circuit for incoherent photonic computing. The high bandwidth of the packaging is crucial to couple the full 100 nm bandwidth spectrum of a superluminescent light emitting diode, which consequently enables low noise computing at 17.6 GBaud. Our concept enables multiport, passive and reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit packaging providing reliability and versatility driving photonic packaging towards the scalability and robustness of electric chip packaging.</description>

      <title>Integrated angstrom-tunable polarization-resolved solid-state photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of high-quality solid-state photon sources is essential to nano optics, quantum photonics, and related fields. A key objective of this research area is to develop tunable photon sources that not only enhance the performance but also offer dynamic functionalities. However, the realization of compact and robust photon sources with precise and wide range tunability remains a long-standing challenge. Moreover, the lack of an effective approach to integrate nanoscale photon sources with dynamic systems has hindered tunability beyond mere spectral adjustments, such as simultaneous polarization control. Here we propose a platform based on quantum emitter (QE) embedded metasurfaces (QEMS) integrated with a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-positioned microcavity, enabling on-chip multi-degree control of solid-state photon sources. Taking advantages of MEMS-QEMS, we show that typically broadband room-temperature emission from nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy centres can be narrowed to 3.7 nm and dynamically tuned with angstrom resolution. Furthermore, we design a wavelength-polarization-multiplexed QEMS and demonstrate polarization-resolved control of the MEMS-QEMS emission in a wide wavelength range (650 nm to 700 nm) along with polarization switching at sub-millisecond timescales. We believe that the proposed MEMS-QEMS platform can be adapted for most existing QEs, significantly expanding their room-temperature capabilities and thereby enhancing their potential for advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Degradation and SEI Evolution in Alloy Anodes Revealed by Correlative Liquid-Cell Electrochemistry and Cryogenic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding solid liquid interfaces at high spatial and chemical resolution is crucial for advancing electrochemical energy storage technologies, yet this remains a persistent challenge due to the lack of characterisation techniques that can capture dynamic processes and preserve fragile interfacial chemistries. In lithium ion batteries, interfacial phenomena such as lithium alloying, solid electrolyte interphase formation, and electrode degradation play a decisive role in capacity retention and failure mechanisms but are difficult to observe in their native state due to high mobility, reactivity, and low atomic number of lithium. Here, we use a recently introduced correlative operando characterisation approach that integrates electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy with cryogenic atom probe tomography to resolve the evolution of a platinum alloy anode at the solid liquid interface during electrochemical cycling. This correlative, cryo enabled workflow reveals spatially heterogeneous SEI formation, the presence of lithium carbonate rich inner SEI layers, and the retention of elemental lithium within the platinum electrode, most likely trapped along grain boundaries. Additionally, we observe the formation of mossy lithium structures and irreversible lithium loss through dead lithium accumulation. Our results provide direct mechanistic insight into lithium alloying and degradation pathways in alloy based anodes and establish a generalised platform for probing dynamic electrochemical interfaces with complementary structural and chemical sensitivity. The methodology is broadly applicable to next generation electrode materials and electrochemical devices where interfacial dynamics dictate performance and stability.</description>

      <title>A miniaturized magnetic field sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Here, we present a fully integrated and mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor with a tip diameter of $1.25 \mathrm{mm}$. On its tip, a direct laser writing process is used to fixate a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core inside a polymer structure. Additionally, a metallic direct laser-written antenna structure next to the fiber facet allows efficient microwave manipulation of NV center spins. The sensor achieves a shot-noise limited magnetic field sensitivity of $5.9 \mathrm{nT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ using a $15 \mathrm{\mu m}$-sized microdiamond at a microwave power of $50 \mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15 \mathrm{mW}$. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-fiber concept that enables, in combination with a direct laser-written structure, independent guiding of excitation and fluorescence light and thus reduces background autofluorescence. While the demonstrated sensitivity is achieved using a single-fiber configuration, the dual-fiber approach provides a path towards integrating smaller diamonds, where autofluorescence would otherwise limit performance. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen vacancy center in diamond-based Faraday magnetometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a versatile color center used for magnetometry, quantum computing, and quantum communications. In this article, using a single laser beam as a pump and probe, we measure the spin states of the NV center using the Faraday effect and use such measurements to develop a novel magnetic field sensor. Using the spin-state-dependent effect on the left and right circularly polarized light, we probe and confirm the existence of spin-orbit coupling in the NV center at room temperature. The sensitivity of our magnetometer is $350~$nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$, limited by the background produced by the laser trapped inside the diamond. We argue that by using an optical cavity and a high-purity diamond, sensitivities in the femtotesla level can be achieved.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Design Wavelength Demultiplexer for On-Chip Photoluminescence Sorting in TMDC Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer a promising platform for on-chip integrated photonics because of their unique optical and electronic properties. Their naturally passivated surfaces make them highly tolerant to lattice mismatch, enabling seamless heterogeneous integration by stacking different van der Waals materials, a crucial step in the development of advanced photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate the use of an inverse design wavelength demultiplexing waveguides for on-chip sorting and routing of distinct photoluminescence from the heterojunction formed by WS2 and WSe2 monolayers. The integrated nanophotonic chip splits and sorts excitonic emission into individual waveguides at room temperature. Our demonstration opens up new perspectives for integrating light sources in van der Waals materials with functional integrated photonics, offering a versatile platform for both fundamental research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Can 2D materials enable passively $Q$-switched lasers in the nanoscale?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving compact on-chip pulsed lasers with attractive performance metrics and compatibility with the silicon photonics platform is an important, yet elusive, goal in contemporary nanophotonics. Here, the fundamental question of whether 2D materials can be utilized as both gain and saturable absorption media to enable compact integrated passively Q-switched nanophotonic lasers is posed and addressed by examining a broad range of 2D material families. The study is conducted by developing a temporal coupled-mode theory framework involving semi-classical rate equations that is capable of rigorously handling gain and saturable absorption by 2D materials, allowing to perform stability and bifurcation analysis covering broad parameter spaces. The range of pulse-train metrics (repetition rate, pulse width, peak power) that can be obtained via different 2D materials is thoroughly assessed. Our work illustrates that nanophotonic cavities enhanced with 2D materials can enable passive Q-switching with repetition rates ranging up to 50~GHz, short pulse duration down to few picoseconds, and peak power exceeding several milliwatts. Such attractive metrics, along with the ultrathin nature of 2D materials and the ability to electrically tune their properties, demonstrate the potential of the proposed platform for compact and flexible integrated laser sources.</description>

      <title>Observation of narrow-band $\gamma$ radiation from a boron-doped diamond superlattice with an 855 MeV electron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A diamond superlattice with a period length of 3.54 $\mu$m was grown on a high quality straight (100) diamond plate with the method of Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD). A sinusoidal varying boron doping profile resulted in a periodic variation of the lattice constant, and in turn four sinusoidally deformed (110) planes with a period length of 5.0 $\mu$m and an amplitude of 0.138 nm. A channeling experiment was performed with the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI accelerator facility. Part of the impinging electrons perform sinusoidal oscillations resulting in the emission of quasi-monochromatic $\gamma$ radiation. A clear peak was observed with a large sodium iodide scintillation detector close to the expected photon energy of 1.33 MeV. Gross properties like photon energy, width and intensity of the peak can be reproduced fairly well by idealized Monte-Carlo simulation calculations. Based on the latter, prospects of applying such $\gamma$ radiation sources are addressed with the example of the photonuclear reaction $^{100}$Mo($\gamma$,n)$^{99}$Mo at 14.3 MeV to produce the medical important $^{99m}$Tc isotope.</description>
