      <title>Noble Gas Fractionation Predictions for High Speed Sampling in the Upper Atmosphere of Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Venus, our neighboring planet, is an open-air laboratory that can be used to study why Earth and Venus evolved in such different ways. Noble gases in planetary atmospheres are tracers of their geophysical evolution, and measuring the elemental and isotopic composition of noble gases in the Venus atmosphere informs us about the origin and evolution of the entire planet. In this work we describe a new SmallSat mission concept, Venus ATMOSpheric - Sample Return (VATMOS-SR), that would return gas samples from the upper atmosphere of Venus to Earth for scientific analysis. To ensure it is possible to relate the composition of the sampled gases (acquired when the spacecraft is traveling &gt;10 km/s) to the free stream atmospheric composition, large-scale numerical simulations are employed to model the flow into and through the sampling system. An emphasis is placed on quantifying noble gas elemental and isotopic fractionation that occurs during the sample acquisition and transfer process, to determine how measured isotopic ratios of noble gases in the sample would compare to the actual isotopic ratios in the Venusian atmosphere. We find that lighter noble gases are depleted after they are sampled compared to the freestream conditions, and heavier ones are enriched, due to the high pressure gradients present in the flowfield. Finally, we observe that, in general, the numerical parameters do not have a major impact on the observed fractionation. However, the freestream velocity and density have a major impact on fractionation and need to be precisely known to properly reconstruct the fractionation in the sampling system. We demonstrate that the sample fractionation can be predicted with numerical simulations, and believe that VATMOS-SR, which could be the first mission to bring back samples from another planet, could answer key scientific questions related to understanding the evolution of Venus.</description>

      <title>Initial Observations of the First BlueBird Spacecraft and a Model of Their Brightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a large set of visual observations, the mean apparent magnitude of BlueBird satellites is 3.44, while the mean of magnitudes adjusted to a uniform distance of 1000 km is 3.84. Near zenith the spacecraft can be as bright as magnitude 0.5. While these spacecraft are bright enough to impact astronomical observations, they can for periods be fainter than the BlueWalker 3 prototype satellite. A model for their brightness shows that design changes since the BlueWalker 3 mission can explain the behavior of BlueBird.</description>

      <title>Pitch Angle Measurement Method based on Detector Counts Distribution. -I. Basic conception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an X-ray and gamma-ray all-sky monitor aiming for high energy astrophysical transients, Gravitational-wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) has also made a series of observational discoveries on burst events of gamma-rays and particles in the low Earth orbit. Pitch angle is one of the key parameters of charged particles traveling around geomagnetic field. However, the usage of the GECAM-style instruments to measure the pitch angle of charged particles is still lacking. Here we propose a novel method for GECAM and similar instruments to measure the pitch angle of charged particles based on detector counts distribution. The basic conception of this method and simulation studies are described. With this method, the pitch angle of a peculiar electron precipitation event detected by GECAM-C is derived to be about 90$^\circ$, demonstrating the feasibility of our method. We note that the application of this method on GECAM-style instruments may open a new window for studying space particle events, such as Terrestrial Electron Beams (TEBs) and Lightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).</description>

      <title>GECAM Discovery of Peculiar Oscillating Particle Precipitation Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged particle precipitation typically manifests as a gradual increase and decrease of flux observed by space detectors. Cases with rapidly flux variation are very rare. Periodic events are even more extraordinary. These oscillating particle precipitation (OPP) events are usually attributed to the bounce motion of electrons, which are induced by lightning. Owing to the observation limitations, there has been debate regarding whether these oscillations originate from temporal flux evolution or spatial structure evolution. Here we report three peculiar charged particle precipitation events detected by GECAM during a geomagnetic storm on March 21, 2024, with two exhibiting significant periodicity. These events were observed around the same region during three consecutive orbits. Through comprehensive temporal and spectral analyses, we revealed that one of the OPP events exhibited a transition in spectral lag of mini-pulses, shifting from "softer-earlier" to "softer-later" while showing no significant time evolution in overall frequency characteristics. And there is no association found between these two OPP events and lightning activity. Several possible scenarios are discussed to explain these charged particles with a life time of more than 3.5 hours, but the nature of these three events remains an enigma. We suggest that these GECAM-detected OPP events may represent a new type of particle precipitation event or a peculiar Lightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).</description>
