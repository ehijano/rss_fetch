      <title>Retracing the Cold Plasma Dispersion Law in Pulsar B0329+54: New Insights into Frequency-Dependent Dispersion Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple studies have investigated potential frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DM) in PSR B0329+54, with sensitivities at levels of $10^{-3} \, \text{pc} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$ or higher, using frequencies below 1 GHz. Utilizing the extensive bandwidth of the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, we conducted simultaneous observations of this pulsar across a frequency range of 300 to 1460 MHz. Our observations reveal a distinct point in the pulse profile of PSR B0329+54 that appears to align remarkably well with the cold-plasma dispersion law, resulting in a unique measured DM across the entire frequency range. In contrast, using times of arrival (ToAs) from widely adopted pulsar timing techniques (e.g., FFTFIT)-leads to frequency-dependent DMs. We investigated the potential causes of these frequency-dependent DMs in this pulsar and their relationship with the underlying magnetic field geometry corresponding to the radio emission. Our study reveals that all frequencies in the range 300-1460 MHz originate from a region no larger than 204 km, and the dipolar magnetic-field geometry model indicates that the emission region is centered at $\sim$800 km from the star. This is the tightest constraint on the size of the emission region reported so far for PSR B0329+54 at the given frequencies, and it is at least five times more stringent than the existing emission height constraints based on the dipolar geometry model.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength observations of a jet launch in real time from the post-changing-look Active Galaxy 1ES 1927+654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a high cadence multi-wavelength observational campaign of the enigmatic changing look AGN 1ES 1927+654 from May 2022- April 2024, coincident with an unprecedented radio flare (an increase in flux by a factor of $\sim 60$ over a few months) and the emergence of a spatially resolved jet at $0.1-0.3$ pc scales (Meyer et al. 2024). Companion work has also detected a recurrent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the $2-10$ keV band with an increasing frequency ($1-2$ mHz) over the same period (Masterson et al., 2025). During this time, the soft X-rays ($0.3-2$ keV) monotonically increased by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the UV emission remained near-steady with $&lt;30\%$ variation and the $2-10$ keV flux showed variation by a factor $\lesssim 2$. The weak variation of the $2-10$ keV X-ray emission and the stability of the UV emission suggest that the magnetic energy density and accretion rate are relatively unchanged, and that the jet could be launched due to a reconfiguration of the magnetic field (toroidal to poloidal) close to the black hole. Advecting poloidal flux onto the event horizon would trigger the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism, leading to the onset of the jet. The concurrent softening of the coronal slope (from $\Gamma= 2.70\pm 0.04$ to $\Gamma=3.27\pm 0.04$), the appearance of a QPO, and low coronal temperature ($kT_{e}=8_{-3}^{+8}$ keV) during the radio outburst suggest that the poloidal field reconfiguration can significantly impact coronal properties and thus influence jet dynamics. These extraordinary findings in real time are crucial for coronal and jet plasma studies, particularly as our results are independent of coronal geometry.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Emission of Gamma-ray Burst Prompt Phase. II. Spectral Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization spectra had been predicted within the photosphere model. For the purpose of seeking more clues to distinguish between the models, both the time-resolved and time-integrated polarization spectra from optical band to MeV gamma-rays of the magnetic reconnection model are studied here. There are two newly found differences between the two models. First, the time-integrated polarization degree (PD) of the magnetic reconnection model would in general increase with frequency for on-axis observations, while it is not monotonous for the photosphere model. Second, the variations of both the time-integrated and the time-resolved polarization angles (PAs) with frequency of the magnetic reconnection model is not random, while the time-integrated PA varies randomly with frequency for the photosphere model. Therefore, future energy-resolved polarization analysis could distinguish between the two models. In addition, the PA rotation spectra are studied for the first time. The rotation value of PA within the burst duration will decrease with the increase of the observational energy band. Most significant PA rotation would happen for slightly off-axis observations in each energy band. The PA would rotate even for on-axis observations in optical band. Compared with the aligned magnetic field case, the PA rotation is quite rare in the gamma-ray band for the case with a toroidal field in the radiation region.</description>

      <title>Testing disc reprocessing models for AGN optical variability by comparison of X-ray and optical power spectra of NGC 4395</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally thought that AGN optical variability is produced, at least in part, by reprocessing of central X-rays by a surrounding accretion disc, resulting in wavelength-dependent lags between bands. Any good model of AGN optical variability should explain not only these lags, but also the overall pattern of variability as quantified by the power spectral density (PSD). Here we present $\sim$daily g'-band monitoring of the low-mass AGN NGC\,4395 over 3 years. Together with previous TESS and GTC/HiPERCAM observations we produce an optical PSD covering an unprecedented frequency range of $\sim7$ decades allowing excellent determination of PSD parameters. The PSD is well fitted by a bending power law with low-frequency slope $\alpha_{L} = 1.0 \pm 0.2$, high-frequency slope $2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.4}$ and bend timescale $3.0^{+6.6}_{-1.7}\,$\,d. This timescale is close to that derived previously from a damped random walk (DRW) model fitted to just the TESS observations, although $\alpha_{L}$ is too steep to be consistent with a DRW. We compare the observed PSD with one made from light curves synthesized assuming reprocessing of X-rays, as observed by \xmm and Swift, in a disc defined by the observed lags. The simulated PSD is also well described by a bending power law but with a bend two decades higher in frequency. We conclude that the large-amplitude optical variations seen on long-timescales are not due to disc reprocessing but require a second source of variability whose origin is unknown but could be propagating disc accretion rate variations.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Unresolved Sources to Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission from the Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Milky Way serves as a crucial probe for understanding the propagation and interactions of cosmic rays within our galaxy. The Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 10 TeV and 1 PeV has been recently measured by the square kilometer array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The flux is higher than predicted for cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. In this work, we utilize a non-parametric method to derive the source count distribution using the published first LHAASO source catalog. Based on this distribution, we calculate the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse emission measured by KM2A. When comparing our results to the measured diffuse gamma-ray emission, we demonstrate that for the outer Galactic region, the contributions from unresolved sources and those predicted by models are roughly consistent with experimental observations within the uncertainty. However, for the inner Galactic region, additional components are required to account for the observed data.</description>

      <title>Revealing the internal magnetic field configuration of magnetars via their associated periodic signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic deformation of magnetars is affected by their internal magnetic fields, which are generally difficult to be measured directly through observations. In this work, the periodic pulse-phase modulations in the hard X-ray emissions of the magnetars 4U 0142+61, 1E 1547.0-5408, SGR 1900+14, and SGR 1806-20, and the periodicities of fast radio bursts (FRBs) 180916 and 121102 are interpreted as free precession of the (host) magnetars. Using these periodic signals, we investigate the magnetars' internal magnetic fields. In order to simultaneously account for the modulation periods and surface thermal emissions of the former four magnetars, and require that their internal poloidal fields smoothly connect with the surface dipole fields, the parameter that characterizes the distribution of toroidal field in the magnetar interior should satisfy $\beta\gtrsim1$. Moreover, their volume-averaged strengths of poloidal and toroidal fields are respectively $\bar{B}_{\rm p}\sim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G and $\bar{B}_{\rm t}\sim10^{15}$ G with the strength ratios $\bar{B}_{\rm t}/\bar{B}_{\rm p}$ generally distributing within $\sim2$--$37$. We could also constrain the critical temperature for neutron superfluidity in the neutron-star core considering that the former four magnetars are probably precessing, and the most stringent constraint is $T_{\rm c,core}&lt;6.4\times10^8$ K. Adopting a possible critical temperature $T_{\rm c,core}=5\times10^8$ K, we could obtain $\bar{B}_{\rm p}\gtrsim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G and $\bar{B}_{\rm t}\gtrsim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G for the host magnetars of FRBs 180916 and 121102, which indicates that the magnetars of our interest possibly have similar poloidal and toroidal fields.</description>

      <title>Searches for primary photons and neutrinos with the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02923v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory stands as the largest detector for ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays. The Observatory is also sensitive to UHE photons and neutrinos that can be produced along with UHE cosmic rays or in top-down processes, such as the decay of dark matter particles. The search for these neutral particles relies on the hybrid measurements of extensive air showers, combining a fluorescence detector with a surface detector array and an underground muon detector. We present an overview of the searches for UHE photons and neutrinos utilizing data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. Currently, no photon or neutrino candidates have been identified. Consequently, we report on the most stringent limits to the integral UHE photon and neutrino fluxes above 50 PeV and 100 PeV, respectively, from diffuse and point-like steady sources. These limits led to strong constraints on theoretical models describing the cosmological evolution of the acceleration sites and the nature of dark-matter particles. Lastly, we briefly comment on the searches for these neutral particles in coincidence with gravitational wave events, underscoring the pivotal role of the Observatory in the context of multi-messenger astronomy at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>A two-hump spectrum in the prompt emission of GRB 240825A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extra hard spectral component that extends to GeV energies, in additional to the typical sub- MeV Band component, appears in several gamma-ray burst (GRBs) detected by Fermi Large Area Telescopes (LAT). Only in one case (i.e., GRB 090926A), a spectral break feature at the high energy end is identified in the extra hard component, but the photon counts are not enough to distinguish between the cutoff model and the broken power law model for the spectral break. In this work, we report the detection of an extra hard component showing the spectral break in GRB 240825A. We find that a broken power-law model fits the spectral data of the extra component better than a single power-law with an exponential cutoff in the time resolved spectrum for the second emission pulse, with a break at about 50 MeV. This spectral feature disfavors the gamma-ray opacity to pair creation as the origin of the spectral break, but points to an intrinsic peak for the extra component. The low ratio between the peak of the extra hard component and that of the Band component challenges the synchrotron self-Compton origin for the extra component. Alternative scenarios, such as the inverse Compton scattering of the photosphere emission, are discussed. In addition, we find a clear transition from the prompt emission to afterglow emission at GeV energies in GRB 240825A, manifested by a temporal steep decay and an unique spectral evolution.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Newtonian simulation of a thin accretion disk around a Reissner-Nordstr\"om naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first numerical simulations of a thin accretion disk around a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) naked singularity (a charged point mass). The gravity of the RN naked singularity is modeled with a pseudo-Newtonian potential that reproduces exactly the radial dependence of the RN Keplerian orbital frequency; in particular, orbital angular velocity vanishes at the zero gravity radius and has a maximum at 4/3 of that radius. Angular momentum is transported outwards by viscous stresses only outside the location of this maximum. Nonetheless, even at that radius, accretion proceeds at higher latitudes, the disk having thickened there owing to excess pressure. The accretion stops at a certain distance away from the singularity, with the material accumulating in a toroidal structure close to the zero-gravity sphere. The shape of the structure obtained in our simulations is reminiscent of fluid figures of equilibrium analytically derived in full general relativity for the RN singularity. The presence of a rotating ring, such as the one found in our simulations, could be an observational signature of a naked singularity. For charge to mass ratios close to but larger than unity, the inner edge of the quasi-toroidal inner accretion structure would be located well within the Schwarzschild marginally stable orbit (ISCO), and the maximum orbital frequency in thin accretion disks would be much higher than the Schwarzschild ISCO frequency.</description>

      <title>Enabling Strong Neutrino Self-interaction with an Unparticle Mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent explorations of the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe have indicated a preference for sizable neutrino self-interactions, much stronger than what the Standard Model offers. When interpreted in the context of simple particle-physics models with a light, neutrinophilic scalar mediator, some of the hints are already in tension with the combination of terrestrial, astrophysical and cosmological constraints. We take a novel approach by considering neutrino self-interactions through a mediator with a smooth, continuous, spectral density function. We consider Georgi's unparticle with a mass gap as a concrete example and point out two useful effects for mitigating two leading constraints. 1) The Unparticle is ``broadband'' -- it occupies a wide range of masses which allows it to pass the early universe constraint on effective number of extra neutrinos ($\Delta N_{\rm eff.}$) even if the mass gap lies below the MeV scale. 2) Scattering involving unparticles is less resonant -- which lifts the constraint set by IceCube based on a recent measurement of ultra-high-energy cosmogenic neutrinos. Our analysis shows that an unparticle mediator can open up ample parameter space for strong neutrino self-interactions of interest to cosmology and serves a well-motivated target for upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Search for continuous gravitational wave signals from luminous dark photon superradiance clouds with LVK O3 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance clouds of kinetically-mixed dark photons around spinning black holes can produce observable multi-messenger electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals. The cloud generates electric fields of up to a Teravolt-per-meter, which lead to a cascade production of charged particles, yielding a turbulent quasi-equilibrium plasma around the black hole, and resulting in electromagnetic fluxes ranging from supernova to pulsar-like luminosities. For stellar mass black holes, such systems resemble millisecond pulsars and are expected to emit pulsating radio waves and continuous gravitational waves (CWs) within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. We select 44 sources with approximately coincident frequencies or positive frequency drifts from existing pulsar catalogs as potential candidates of long-lasting superradiance clouds around old galactic black holes. For a subset of 34 sources that are well measured and have not been previously targeted, we perform the first search for CW emission in LVK data from the third observing run. We find no evidence of a CW signal and place 95% confidence level upper limits on the emitted strain amplitude. We interpret these results, together with limits from previous searches, in terms of the underlying dark photon theory by performing an analysis of the expected signals from superradiance clouds from galactic black holes. We find that, even for moderately spinning black holes, the absence of an observed CW signal disfavors a discrete set of dark photon masses between about $10^{-13}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-12}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and kinetic mixing couplings in the range of $10^{-9}$-$10^{-7}$, subject to assumptions about the properties of the black hole population and the cloud's electromagnetic emission.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for the development of superradiant instabilities in charged black-hole spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical and mathematical properties of charged black holes that are linearly coupled to charged massive scalar fields are studied analytically. In particular, we prove that, in the eikonal large-mass regime $M\mu\gg1$, the compact dimensionless inequality $\Phi_{\text{H}}&gt;Q/M$ provides a sufficient condition for the development of superradiant instabilities in the curved black-hole spacetime [here $\{M,Q,\Phi_{\text{H}}\}$ are respectively the mass, the electric charge, and the horizon electrostatic potential of the central black hole and $\mu$ is the proper mass of the field]. The familiar charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole does not satisfy this inequality. On the other hand, we explicitly prove that all charged Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia (ABG) black-hole spacetimes satisfy this analytically derived sufficient condition and may therefore become superradiantly unstable to perturbations of charged massive scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Parity doubled nucleons can rapidly cool neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In confined hadronic matter, the spontaneous breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry can be described by considering nucleons, $N_{+}(939)$, and excited states of opposite parity, $N_{-}(1535)$. In a cold, dense hadronic phase where chiral symmetry remains spontaneously broken, direct Urca decay processes involving the $N_{-}$ are possible, e.g. $N_- \rightarrow N_+ + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$. We show that at low temperature and moderate densities, because the $N_-$ is much heavier than the $N_+$, such cooling dominates over standard $N_+$ direct Urca processes. This provides a strong constraint on chiral symmetry restoration in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>VLT VIMOS Integral Field Spectroscopy of the nova remnant FH Ser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FH Ser experienced a slow classical nova outburst in February 1970 that was the first one observed at UV, optical, and IR wavelengths. Its nova remnant is elliptical in shape, with multiple knots, and a peculiar ring-like filament along its minor axis. This work aims at unveiling its true 3D spatio-kinematical structure to investigate the effects of early shaping and to assess its mass and kinetic energy using VLT VIMOS integral field spectroscopic observations. The data cube has been analyzed using 3D visualisations that reveal different structural components. FH Ser consists of a tilted prolate ellisoidal shell, most prominent in H-alpha, and a ring-like structure, most prominent in [N II]. The ellipsoidal shell has equatorial and polar velocities of 505 and 630 km/s, respectively, with its major axis tilted by 52 deg with respect to the line of sight. The inclination angle of the symmetry axis of the ring is similar, i.e., it can be described as an equatorial belt of the main ellipsoidal shell. The ionized mass is 2.6E-4 solar mass, with a kinetic energy of 1.6E45 erg. The presence of two different structural components in FH Ser with similar orientation can be linked to a density enhancement along a plane, most likely the orbital plane at the time of the nova event. The acquisition of integral field spectroscopic observations of nova remnants is most required to disentangle different structural components and to assess their 3D physical structure.</description>

      <title>Evolutions of in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross sections and stiffness of dense nuclear matter from Bayesian analyses of FOPI proton flow excitation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within a Bayesian statistical framework using a Gaussian Process (GP) emulator for an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions, we infer from the proton directed and elliptical flow in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies from 150 to 1200 MeV/nucleon taken by the FOPI Collaboration the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross section modification factor $X$ (with respect to their free-space values) and the stiffness parameter $K$ of dense nuclear matter. We find that the most probable value of $X$ evolves from around 0.7 to 1.0 as the beam energy $E_{beam}/A$ increases. On the other hand, the posterior PDF($K$) may have dual peaks having roughly the same height or extended shoulders at high $K$ values. More quantitatively, the posterior PDF($K$) changes from having a major peak around 220 MeV characterizing a soft EOS in the reaction at $E_{beam}/A$=150 MeV to one that peaks around 320 MeV indicating a stiff EOS in the reactions at $E_{beam}/A$ higher than about 600 MeV. The transition from soft to stiff happens in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies around 250 MeV/nucleon in which $K=220$ MeV and $K=320$ MeV are approximately equally probable. Altogether, the FOPI proton flow excitation function data indicate a gradual hardening of hot and dense nuclear matter as its density and temperature increase in reactions with higher beam energies.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric Study of GRS 1915+105: Estimation of Interstellar Polarization Component</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRS 1915+105 is a well-known X-ray binary system composed of a black hole with a low-mass companion star and is recognized for emitting relativistic jets. Imazato et al. (2021) performed extensive polarimetry in a near-infrared (NIR) Ks band from 2019 April through December when GRS 1915+105 experienced an X-ray low luminous state and found almost stable polarization of P=2.42% +/- 0.08%. We performed NIR polarimetry of the field stars around GRS 1915+105 in 2023 April and October, and found that the field stars that are not listed in Gaia DR3 and StarHorse2 catalogues show well aligned polarization that is consistent with GRS 1915+105' s polarization. Those suggest that the interstellar clouds existing beyond 4 kpc causes the large interstellar extinction and that the polarization the GRS 1915+105 is mostly originated from the magnetically aligned dust grains within the clouds. Therefore, the jet-origin synchrotron radiation polarization would have given only minor contribution in the NIR band in 2019 Apr-Dec.</description>

      <title>Interactions among binary black holes in star clusters: eccentric gravitational wave captures and triple formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Numerical simulations of star clusters with black holes find that there is only a single dynamically active binary black hole (BBH), at odds with the theoretical expectation of ~5 dynamically-formed - or, 'three-body' - BBHs in clusters with a few hundred BHs. We test the recent suggestion that this tension is because interactions among three-body BBHs were neglected in the theory.
  Methods. We use the public catalogue of Cluster Monte Carlo models to obtain a sample of strong BBH-BBH interactions, which we integrate using the 3.5PN equations of motion. We explore the nature of the BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions in star clusters, as well as the various outcomes: gravitational wave (GW) captures and the associated eccentricities at the frequencies of ground-based GW detectors, as well as BH triple formation and their contribution to BBH mergers via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism.
  Results. We find that almost all BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions are indeed three-body binaries and that BBH formation and disruption in BBH-BBH interactions occur at approximately the same rate, providing an explanation for the finding of a single dynamically-active BBH in N-body models. An important implication is that the resulting rates of GW capture and triple formation are independent of uncertain initial binary properties. We obtain a local rate of GW captures of $\mathcal{R}(z\simeq0)\rm\simeq1Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$, as well as their eccentricity distribution and redshift dependence. We find that a BBH-BBH interaction is more likely to trigger a GW merger than a BH-BBH interaction. We also find that stable triples that are assembled in BBH-BBH interactions are very wide and not likely to merge via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations because they quickly break up in subsequent interactions with BHs and BBHs. Our results will help with the interpretation of future GW signals from eccentric BBHs</description>

      <title>The NewAthena mission concept in the context of the next decade of X-ray astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large X-ray observatories such as Chandra and XMM-Newton have been delivering scientific breakthroughs in research fields as diverse as our Solar System, the astrophysics of stars, stellar explosions and compact objects, accreting super-massive black holes, and large-scale structures traced by the hot plasma permeating and surrounding galaxy groups and clusters. The recently launched observatory XRISM is opening in earnest the new observational window of non-dispersive high-resolution spectroscopy. However, several quests are left open, such as the effect of the stellar radiation field on the habitability of nearby planets, the Equation-of-State regulating matter in neutron stars, the origin and distribution of metals in the Universe, the processes driving the cosmological evolution of the baryons locked in the gravitational potential of Dark Matter and the impact of supermassive black hole growth on galaxy evolution, just to mention a few. Furthermore, X-ray astronomy is a key player in multi-messenger astrophysics. Addressing these quests experimentally requires an order-of-magnitude leap in sensitivity, spectroscopy and survey capabilities with respect to existing X-ray observatories. This paper succinctly summarizes the main areas where high-energy astrophysics is expected to contribute to our understanding of the Universe in the next decade and describes a new mission concept under study by the European Space Agency, the scientific community worldwide and two International Partners (JAXA and NASA), designed to enable transformational discoveries: NewAthena. This concept inherits its basic payload design from a previous study carried out until 2022, Athena.</description>

      <title>GRB 190114C: Fireball Energy Budget and Radiative Efficiency Revisited</title>

Abstract: The jet composition of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as well as how efficiently the jet converts its energy to radiation, are long-standing problems in GRB physics. Here, we reported a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the TeV-emitting bright GRB 190114C. Its high fluence ($\sim$ 4.4$\times$10$^{-4}$ erg cm$^{-2}$) allows us to conduct the time-resolved spectral analysis in great detail and study their variations down to a very short time-scale ($\sim$0.1 s) while preserving a high significance. Its prompt emission consists of three well-separated pulses. The first two main pulses ($P_1$ and $P_2$) exhibit independently strong thermal components, starting from the third pulse ($P_3$) and extending to the entire afterglow, the spectra are all nonthermal, the synchrotron plus Compton upscattering model well interprets the observation. By combining the thermal ($P_1$ and $P_2$) and the nonthermal ($P_3$) observations based on two different scenarios (global and pulse properties) and following the method described in Zhang et al., we measure the fireball parameters and GRB radiative efficiency with little uncertainties for this GRB. A relevantly high GRB radiative efficiency is obtained based on both the global and pulse properties, suggesting that if GRBs are powered by fireballs, the efficiency can sometimes be high. More interestingly, though the observed parameters are individually different (e.g., the amount of mass loading $M$), the radiative efficiency obtained from $P_1$ ($\eta_\gamma=36.0\pm6.5\%$) and $P_2$ ($\eta_\gamma=41.1\pm1.9\%$) is roughly the same, which implies that the central engine of the same GRB has some common properties.</description>

      <title>Impact of radiative cooling on the magnetised geometrically thin accretion disk around Kerr black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that the spectral state transitions of the outbursts in X-ray binaries (XRBs) are triggered by the rise of the mass accretion rate due to underlying disc instabilities. Recent observations found that characteristics of disc winds are probably connected with the different spectral states, but the theoretical underpinnings of it are highly ambiguous. To understand the correlation between disc winds and the dynamics of the accretion flow, we have performed General Relativistic Magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of an axisymmetric thin accretion disc with different accretion rates and magnetic field strengths. Our simulations have shown that the dynamics and the temperature properties depend on both accretion rates and magnetic field strengths. We later found that these properties greatly influence spectral properties. We calculated the average coronal temperature for different simulation models, which is correlated with high-energy Compton emission. Our simulation models reveal that the average coronal temperature is anti-correlated with the accretion rates, which are correlated with the magnetic field strengths. We also found that the structured component of the disc winds (Blandford-Payne disc wind) predominates as the accretion rates and magnetic field strengths increase. In contrast, the turbulent component of the disc winds ($B_{\rm tor}$ disc wind) predominates as the accretion rates and magnetic field strengths decrease. Our results suggest that the disc winds during an outburst in XRBs can only be understood if the magnetic field contribution varies over time (e.g., MAXI J1820+070).</description>

      <title>Covariant approach to relativistic large-eddy simulations: Lagrangian filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-principle implementation of the first fully covariant filtering scheme applied to relativistic fluid turbulence. The filtering is performed with respect to special observers, identified dynamically as moving with the "bulk of the flow". This means that filtering does not depend on foliations of spacetime but rather on the intrinsic fibration traced out by the observers. The covariance of the approach means that the results may be lifted into an arbitrary, curved spacetime. This practical step follows theoretical work showing that the residuals introduced by filtering a fine-scale ideal fluid can be represented by a non-ideal fluid prescription at the coarse scale. We interpret such non-ideal terms using a simple first-order gradient model, which allows us to extract effective turbulent viscosities and conductivity. A statistical regression on these terms shows that the majority of their variation may be explained by the thermodynamic properties of the filtered fluid and invariants of its flow, such as the shear and vorticity. This serves as a validation of the method and enables us to fit a functional, power-law form for the non-ideal coefficients -- an approach that may be used practically to give a sub-grid closure model in large-eddy simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray pulsars experiencing extreme mass accretion rates can produce neutrino emission in the MeV energy band. Neutrinos in these systems are emitted in close proximity to the stellar surface and subsequently undergo gravitational bending in the space curved by a neutron star. This process results in the formation of a distinct beam pattern of neutrino emission and gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino pulsars. The energy flux of neutrinos, when averaged over the neutron star's pulsation period, can differ from the isotropic neutrino energy flux, which impacts the detectability of bright pulsars in neutrinos. We investigate the process of neutrino beam pattern formation, accounting for neutron star transparency to neutrinos and gravitational bending. Based on simulated neutrino beam patterns, we estimate the potential difference between the actual and apparent neutrino luminosity. We show that the apparent luminosity can greatly exceed the actual luminosity, albeit only in a small fraction of cases, depending on the specific equation of state and the mass of the star. For example, the amplification can exceed a factor of ten for $\approx0.05\%$ of typical neutron stars with mass of $1.4\,M_\odot$. Strong amplification is less probable for neutron stars of higher mass. In the case of strange stars, a fraction of high energy neutrinos can be absorbed and the beam pattern, as well as the amplification of apparent neutrino luminosity, depend on neutrino energy.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear simulations of neutron star mergers are complicated by the need to represent turbulent dynamics. As we cannot (yet) perform simulations that resolve accurately both the gravitational-wave scale and the smallest scales at which magneto/hydrodynamic turbulence plays a role, we need to rely on approximations. Addressing this problem in the context of large-eddy models, we outline a coherent Lagrangian filtering framework that allows us to explore the many issues that arise, linking conceptual problems to practical implementations and the interpretation of the results. We develop understanding crucial for quantifying unavoidable uncertainties in current and future numerical relativity simulations and consider the implications for neutron-star parameter estimation and constraints on the equation of state of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>A simplified approach for reproducing fully relativistic spectra in X-ray binary systems: Application to Cygnus X-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativistic effects are strong near the black hole of an X-ray binary and significantly impact the total energy released at the innermost accretion disk's region. Our goal is to fully incorporate the black hole's spin and all the general relativistic effects on the observed spectra coming from X-ray binary systems while maintaining the simplicity of the standard disk model. That is possible by appropriately shifting only the disk's inner radius. We employ some of the most efficient pseudo-Newtonian potentials around Kerr black holes and derive two generalized disk temperature profiles, thus incorporating the spin's contribution to the thermal spectra. Then, we associate the observed radiative efficiency with the emission pattern featuring all the relativistic effects included in the kerrbb model, obtaining an expression about the modified inner radius of the disk. Moreover, we apply this method to Cygnus X-1 by fitting the observational data obtained during its high/soft and hard/low spectral states. The fully relativistic spectra are reproduced to a very good approximation with an error margin of 0.03-4%. The disk is parameterized by a modified innermost radius within the range of $(0.2-2)R_{ISCO}$, depending on the source's viewing angle and black hole spin. Relativistic effects near the black hole make an otherwise standard accretion disk with inclination $\theta &lt;60^{\circ}$ seem truncated to larger radii to a distant observer. On the other hand, an edge-on view of the disk gives the perspective of being pulled closer to the central object than the respective ISCO radius. In addition, we show that the observational data of Cygnus X-1 can be satisfactorily fitted by employing a reasonably simple lepto-hadronic jet model and a hybrid thermal/non-thermal corona along with the Kerr-adjusted standard accretion disk.</description>

Abstract: FRB 20121102A was the first fast radio burst to be observed to repeat. Since then, thousands of bursts have been detected by multiple radio telescopes around the world. Previous work has shown an indication of a cyclic activity level with a periodicity of around 160 days. Knowing when the source repeats is essential for planning multi-wavelength monitoring to constrain the emission extent and progenitor source. We report the monitoring of FRB 20121102A using the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope in the L-band and update the periodicity of the cyclic activity level. We used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram on a sample of 284 observing epochs, of which 42% correspond to detections and 58% to non-detections. Our dataset is composed of the seven epochs of our monitoring plus publicly available data. We investigated two methods: i) a binary model, describing the observing epochs with 1 if there are detections and with 0 for non-detections, and ii) a normalised rates model that considers the inferred detections rates. We report no detections in 12.5-hour observations down to a fluence of 0.29 Jy ms. The best period we find for the cyclic activity window is $159.3 \pm 0.8$ days for the binary model and $159.3 \pm 0.3$ days for the normalised rates model. We show the activity phase to be 53%. The normalised rates show clear Gaussian-like behaviour for the activity level, in that the number of detections peak at the centre of the activity window. The periodicity found through both methods is consistent for the L and S-band datasets implying it is intrinsic to the source. The activity phase in the S band however, shows an indication of it ending before the L-band activity phase, supporting the idea of a chromatic dependence of the activity window. The sample in the C-band is not large enough to further confirm this result.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Supernova Gravitational Wave Signal Classification</title>

Abstract: We investigate the potential of using gravitational wave (GW) signals from rotating core-collapse supernovae to probe the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter. By generating GW signals from simulations with various EOSs, we train machine learning models to classify them and evaluate their performance. Our study builds on previous work by examining how different machine learning models, parameters, and data preprocessing techniques impact classification accuracy. We test convolutional and recurrent neural networks, as well as six classical algorithms: random forest, support vector machines, na\"{i}ve Bayes, logistic regression, $k$-nearest neighbors, and eXtreme gradient boosting. All models, except na\"{i}ve Bayes, achieve over 90 per cent accuracy on our dataset. Additionally, we assess the impact of approximating the GW signal using the general relativistic effective potential (GREP) on EOS classification. We find that models trained on GREP data exhibit low classification accuracy. However, normalizing time by the peak signal frequency, which partially compensates for the absence of the time dilation effect in GREP, leads to a notable improvement in accuracy. Despite this, the accuracy does not exceed 70 per cent, suggesting that GREP lacks the precision necessary for EOS classification. Finally, our study has several limitations, including the omission of detector noise and the focus on a single progenitor mass model, which will be addressed in future works.</description>

      <title>Actinide signatures in low electron fraction kilonova ejecta</title>

Abstract: Neutron star (NS) mergers are known to produce heavy elements through rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. Actinides are expected to be created solely by the r-process in the most neutron rich environments. Confirming if NS mergers provide the requisite conditions for actinide creation is therefore central to determining their origin in the Universe. Actinide signatures in kilonova (KN) spectra may yield an answer, provided adequate models are available in order to interpret observational data. In this study, we investigate actinide signatures in neutron rich merger ejecta. We use three ejecta models with different compositions and radioactive power, generated by nucleosynthesis calculations using the same initial electron fraction ($Y_e = 0.15$) but with different nuclear physics inputs and thermodynamic expansion history. These are evolved from 10 - 100 days after merger using the SUMO non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer code. We highlight how uncertainties in nuclear properties, as well as choices in thermodynamic trajectory, may yield entirely different outputs for equal values of $Y_e$. We consider an actinide-free model and two actinide-rich models, and find that the emergent spectra and lightcurve evolution are significantly different depending on the amount of actinides present, and the overall decay properties of the models. We also present potential key actinide spectral signatures, of which doubly ionized $_{89}$Ac and $_{90}$Th may be particularly interesting as spectral indicators of actinide presence in KN ejecta.</description>

      <title>Geometric correction for wind accretion in binary systems</title>

Abstract: The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is widely used to describe how a compact object accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in binary systems. However, its standard implementation becomes inaccurate when the wind velocity ($v_\mathrm{w}$) is comparable to or less than the orbital velocity ($v_\mathrm{o}$), predicting non-physical accretion efficiencies above unity. This limits its applicability to systems with low wind-to-orbital velocity ratios ($w= v_\mathrm{w} / v_\mathrm{o} \leq 1$), such as symbiotic systems. We revisit the implementation of the BHL model and introduce a geometric correction factor that accounts for the varying orientation of the accretion cylinder relative to the wind direction. This correction ensures physically plausible accretion efficiencies ($\eta \leq 1$) for all $w$ in circular orbits. Our new implementation naturally predicts the flattening of the accretion efficiency observed in numerical simulations for $w &lt; 1$, without the need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the implications of our prescription for the less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting the key role of the geometric correction factor in shaping the accretion process. We compare our predictions with numerical simulations, finding good agreement for a wide range of parameters. Applications to the symbiotic star R~Aqr and the X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented. This improved implementation offers a more accurate description of wind accretion in binary systems, with implications for stellar evolution, population synthesis, and observational data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Afterglow Analysis of GRB 221009A: Unveiling the Evolution of a Cooling Break in a Wind-like Medium</title>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosions in the universe, and their afterglow emission provides an opportunity to probe the physics of relativistic shock waves in an extreme environment. Several key pieces for completing the picture of the GRB afterglow physics are still missing, including jet properties, emission mechanism, and particle acceleration. Here we present a study of the afterglow emission of GRB 221009A, the most energetic GRB ever observed. Using optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray data up to approximately two days after the trigger, we trace the evolution of the multi-wavelength spectrum and the physical parameters behind the emission process. The broadband spectrum is consistent with the synchrotron emission emitted by relativistic electrons with its index of $p = 2.29\pm 0.02$. We identify a break energy at keV and an exponential cutoff at GeV in the observed multi-wavelength spectrum. The break energy increases in time from $16.0_{-4.9}^{+7.1}$ keV at 0.65 days to $46.8_{-15.5}^{+25.0}$ keV at 1.68 days, favoring a stellar wind-like profile of the circumburst medium with $k=2.4\pm0.1$ as in $\rho (r) \propto r^{-k}$. The high-energy attenuation at around 0.4 to 4 GeV is attributed to the maximum of the particle acceleration in the relativistic shock wave. This study confirms that the synchrotron process can explain the multi-wavelength afterglow emission and its evolution.</description>

Abstract: The existence of the ultracompact object XTE J1814-338, with an inferred mass and radius of $M$ = 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$ and R = 7.0 $\pm$ 0.4 km, presents a great challenge for the theory of neutron stars. Within this context, we revisit the theory of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars and infer the physical properties of this compact object, such as the Fermi momentum of dark matter necessary to compress the star at such low radius, its equation of state, speed of sound, and some macroscopic properties, such as the moment of inertia and the dimensionless tidal parameter. We also compare the physical properties of the XTE J1814-338 with other pulsars, such as the canonical 1.4 M$_\odot$, the PSR J0740 + 6620, and the HESS J1731-347.</description>

      <title>Detection of a new GeV source in the outer region of the Coma cluster: a signature of external accretion shock ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supersonic flow motions associated with infall of baryonic gas toward sheets and filaments, as well as cluster mergers, produces large-scale shock waves. The shocks associated with galaxy clusters can be classified mainly into two categories: internal shocks appear in the hot intracluster medium within the viral radius, and external accretion shocks form in the outer cold region well outside of the virial radius. Cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and/or protons accelerated by these shocks are expected to produce gamma-rays through inverse-Compton scatterings (ICS) or inelastic $pp$ collisions respectively. Recent studies have found a spatially extended GeV source within the virial radius, consistent with the internal shock origin. Here we report the detection of a new GeV source at a distance of about 2.8$^\circ$ from the center of the Coma cluster through the analysis of 16.2 years of Fermi-LAT data. The hard spectrum of the source, in agreement with the ICS origin, and its location in a large-scale filament of galaxies points to the external accretion shock origin. The gamma-ray ($0.1-10^3$ GeV) luminosity of the source, $1.4\times 10^{42}~ {\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, suggests that a fraction $\sim 10^{-3}$ of the kinetic energy flux through the shock-surface is transferred to relativistic CR electrons.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Gamma Ray Burst Lightcurves: A Machine/Deep Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which are highly energetic bursts, have been detected at high redshifts (z = 9.4) and are pivotal for cosmological research and the study of Population III stars. To address these studies, it is important to identify correlations between the key GRB variables while minimizing uncertainties. This requires comprehensive coverage of GRB Light curves (LCs), which are challenging to obtain given the observational gaps and noise. This study explores the reconstruction of GRB LCs using three machine-learning models: Bi-LSTM, CGAN, and a Sarimax-based Kalman filter. To evaluate these approaches, we also include well-established functional form parametric methods such as the Willingale model (W07) and the non-parametric Gaussian Processes (GPs), expanding upon arXiv:2305.12126 by applying our techniques to a larger sample of 545 GRBs, covering four different GRB classifications. Our findings reveal that the LSTM model achieves the highest reductions in the uncertainties of the plateau parameters, with decreases of 29% in log Ta, 31% in log Fa and 40% in {\alpha}. In comparison, GPs show a slightly smaller reduction of 22% in both log Ta and log Fa, and 32% in {\alpha} while CGANs exhibit a decrease of 23% in log Ta, 24% in log Fa, and 31% in {\alpha}. The Sarimax-based Kalman filter performs well for well-sampled and flare-free GRBs, but it has problems with reconstruction in more complex cases. It shows a decrease of 14% in log Ta, 5% in log Fa and 6% in {\alpha}. [..] For the subset of 299 Good GRBs, namely with well-defined plateau emission with no flares and bumps, the LSTM model achieved a reduction of approximately 40%, with a percentage increase of 8% compared to the results observed in arXiv:2305.12126. [..] These advancements are essential for using GRBs as standard candles in cosmology and investigating theoretical models.[..]</description>

Abstract: The study of pulsar glitch phenomena serves as a valuable probe into the dynamic properties of matter under extreme high-density conditions, offering insights into the physics within neutron stars. Providing theoretical explanations for the diverse manifestations observed in different pulsars has proven to be a formidable challenge. By analyzing the distribution of glitch sizes and waiting times, along with the evolution of cumulative glitch sizes over time, we have uncovered a long-term clustering phenomenon for pulsar glitches. This perspective allows us to approach the distinct glitch representations in various pulsars from a unified standpoint, connecting the same periodicity of observational data to the randomness. Without relying on specific physical models, we utilized the coefficient of variation to numerically determine optimal clustering numbers and clustering periods for sample pulsars. Our analysis involving 27 pulsars has revealed a clear linear relationship between the glitch cluster period and characteristic age. Of interest, the cumulative distribution of functions of cluster sizes and interval times have the same patterns, which can be synchronously fitted by Gaussian processes. These results may indicate novel understandings of glitches and the resulting processes.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino Events Reconstruction has always been crucial for IceCube Neutrino Observatory. In the Kaggle competition "IceCube -- Neutrinos in Deep Ice", many solutions use Transformer. We present ISeeCube, a pure Transformer model based on TorchScale (the backbone of BEiT-3). When having relatively same amount of total trainable parameters, our model outperforms the 2nd place solution. By using TorchScale, the lines of code drop sharply by about 80% and a lot of new methods can be tested by simply adjusting configs. We compared two fundamental models for predictions on a continuous space, regression and classification, trained with MSE Loss and CE Loss respectively. We also propose a new metric, overlap ratio, to evaluate the performance of the model. Since the model is simple enough, it has the potential to be used for more purposes such as energy reconstruction, and many new methods such as combining it with GraphNeT can be tested more easily. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/chenlinear/ISeeCube</description>

Abstract: Magnetic fields remain an enigmatic part of the content of galaxy clusters. Faraday rotation and depolarisation of extragalactic radio sources are useful probes, but the limited availability of polarised radio sources necessitates stacking clusters to study average magnetic field profiles and correlation scales. We recently presented a VLA survey of the 124 most massive Planck clusters at low redshift ($z&lt;0.35$), where a clear depolarisation trend with the cluster impact parameter was found. In this study, we combine the depolarisation information with the observed rotation measure (RM) and present an investigation into the average magnetic field properties of the sample, using both background sources and sources embedded in clusters. We observe a significant increase in the RM scatter, $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}$, closer to the cluster centres. Averaging all 124 clusters, we find a scatter within $R_\mathrm{500}$ of $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}=209\pm37$ rad m$^{-2}$, with background sources and cluster members showing similar values ($200\pm33$ and $219\pm66$ rad m$^{-2}$, respectively). In the simple assumption of a uniform magnetic field with a single fluctuation scale $\Lambda_c$, this translates to an average magnetic field strength of $2\,(\Lambda_c/10\mathrm{kpc})^{-0.5}\, \mu$G. The profile of $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}$ as a function of projected radius is inconsistent with a model that has a simple scaling $B \propto n_e^\eta$, with an observed deficit near the centre of clusters possibly caused by the fact that the highest RM sources near the centre of clusters are depolarised. In a full forward model, we find that the magnetic field power spectrum agrees with the Kolmogorov value, but that none of the Gaussian random field models can fully explain the observed relatively flat profiles. This implies that more sophisticated models of cluster magnetic fields in a cosmological context are needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require substantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks should be achievable with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>
