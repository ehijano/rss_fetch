      <title>Electron conductive self-assembled hybrid low-molecular weight glycolipid-nanosilver gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-molecular weight (LMW) hydrogels are gaining interest over macromolecular gels due to their reversible, dynamic and stimuli-responsive nature. They are potentially interesting functional materials for advanced applications such as catalysis, nanoelectronics or regenerative medicine. One common strategy to enhance the functional properties is to incorporate inorganic nanostructures. However, simultaneous control of the gel mechanics, shape and size of the nanostructures and functional properties is challenging. Here, a biobased, double amphiphilic, bolaform, single-glucose lipid (containing glucose and COOH in opposite directions) is able to coordinate silver ions, drive the formation of a self-assembled fibrous hydrogel and, after controlling the reduction time (seconds to hours) of the reduction process (NaBH4, ascorbate, $\gamma$-rays), stabilize Ag nanoparticles (NPs) of controlled size (2.8 nm $\pm$ 13%). The NPs are spontaneously embedded in the fibers' core following a two-dimensional anisotropic long-range order. Precise control of the reduction parameters (ascorbate) drives the formation of Ag nanowires, possibly due to an anisotropic coalescence process of the nanoparticles. Samples containing Ag nanowires have shown an electronic conductive response, observed with impedance spectroscopy. This works shows the potential of biological amphiphiles to develop under soft conditions (pseudo single step, water, room temperature) advanced hybrid organic/inorganic (O/I) materials with a multiscale structure, order and electron conductivity functionality</description>

      <title>Negative intrinsic viscosity in graphene nanoparticle suspensions induced by hydrodynamic slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viscosity of nanoparticle suspensions is always expected to increase with particle concentration. However, a growing body of experiments on suspensions of atomically thin nanomaterials such as graphene contradicts this expectation. Some experiments indicate effective suspension viscosity values that fall below that of pure solvent at high shear rates and low solid concentrations, i.e., the intrinsic viscosity is negative. To explain this puzzling phenomenon, we combined molecular dynamics and boundary integral simulations to investigate the shear viscosity of few-nanometer graphene sheets in water at high P\'eclet numbers (Pe $&gt; 100$). Our results, covering geometric aspect ratios from 4.5 to 12.0, show robustly that the intrinsic viscosity decreases with increasing aspect ratio and becomes negative beyond a threshold aspect ratio $\approx 5.5$. We demonstrate that this anomalous behavior originates from hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid interface, which suppresses particle rotation and promotes stable alignment with the flow direction, thereby reducing viscous dissipation relative to dissipation in pure solvent. This slip mechanism holds for both fully 3D disc-like and quasi-2D particle geometries explored in the molecular simulations. As the concentration of graphene particles increases in the dilute regime, the viscosity initially decreases, falling below that of pure water. At higher concentrations, however, particle aggregation becomes significant, leading to a rise in viscosity after a minimum is reached. These findings confirm the occurrence of a negative intrinsic viscosity in a graphene suspension due only to hydrodynamic effects. Our work has important implications for the design of lubricants, inks, and nanocomposites with tunable viscosity.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation equilibrium as a probe of the pressure equation of state of active colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical and computational framework for extracting the pressure equation of state (EoS) of an active suspension from its steady-state sedimentation profile. As EoSs are prerequisites for many theories in active matter, determining how pressure depends on key parameters such as density, activity, and interparticle interactions is essential to make quantitative predictions relevant to materials design and engineering applications. Focusing on the one-dimensional active Brownian particle (1D-ABP) model, we show that the pressure measured in a homogeneous periodic system can be recovered from the spatial profiles established in sedimentation equilibrium. Our approach is based on exact mechanical considerations and provides a direct route for determining pressure from experimentally measurable quantities. This work compares sedimentation-derived equations of state with those obtained from periodic simulations, establishing a foundation for using sedimentation as a generic tool to characterize the behavior of active suspensions.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Equations for Active Brownian Particles in the High Persistence Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a recently proposed kinetic description of non-inertial active Brownian particles, Navier--Stokes-like equations are derived in the high persistence regime, where polarization is a slow field together with density. Using the Chapman--Enskog method, all transport coefficients in the equations are obtained in terms of microscopic quantities. A linear stability analysis of the homogeneous and isotropic state shows the appearance of a density instability, allowing us to determine the regions of phase space where the motility induced phase separation occurs. Numerical solutions of the equations in one spatial dimension show the need of an additional regularizing pressure term. With the inclusion of this term, the solutions illustrate in detail the clustering dynamics in homogeneous conditions, as well as the behavior that emerges when a gravitational field is applied in presence of a wall.</description>

      <title>Interfacial instability of confined 3D active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instabilities of fluid-fluid interfaces are ubiquitous in passive soft matter. Adding activity to the interface or either fluid can dramatically change the stability of the interface. Using experiment and theory, we investigate the interfacial instability of a deformable 3D active nematic liquid crystal droplet in the isotropic phase surrounded by a passive fluid and confined between two parallel plates. Spontaneous active flows drive the growth of undulations along the active/passive interface, with the mode number of the fastest-growing mode increasing with droplet radius and decreasing with gap height. We apply the lubrication approximation to a minimal nematohydrodynamic model to determine the growth rates of all interfacial modes. The magnitude of the growth rate is determined by the active timescale and the relaxation timescales associated with liquid crystalline order, as well as capillary and viscous stresses. We find multiple points of agreement between experiment and theory, including the shape evolution of individual droplets, the growth rates of unstable modes averaged across many droplets, and the extensional shear flows observed within droplets.</description>

      <title>Morphoelastic ribbons: Differential growth-induced curvature and torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural slender structures, such as plant leaves, petals, and tendrils, often exhibit complex three-dimensional (3D) morphologies-including twisting, helical coiling, and saddle-bending-driven by differential growth. The resulting internal stresses are partially relieved through the development of intrinsic curvature and torsion. The fundamental challenge lies in effectively correlating microscopic growth fields to the macroscopic shapes and mechanical responses of the ribbon structures. However, existing ribbon or shell models struggle to directly link growth gradients to macroscopic curvature and torsion, necessitating a reduced-dimensional framework. This work establishes a unified one-dimensional (1D) morphoelastic ribbon model derived rigorously from 3D finite elasticity theory via a two-step asymptotic dimension reduction. The reduced-order model captures key geometric nonlinearities and finite rotations while retaining explicit dependence on the growth tensor. We obtain analytical solutions for saddle-bending and twisting configurations induced by specific growth gradients. Furthermore, numerical continuation, based on the reduced model, reveals post-buckling transitions into helical morphologies, identifying bifurcation thresholds and constructing phase diagrams. This framework explicitly links growth fields to ribbon curvature and torsion, providing fundamental mechanics insights into the morphogenesis of slender plant organs and offering the potential for bioinspired soft robotics design.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of Tracer Particles in Early Growing Biofilms. A Computer Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion of particles in complex media has gained significant interest due to its dual relevance: probing the viscoelastic properties of materials via microrheology and assessing the extent of particle displacement over time. In this work, we explore the early-stage diffusion of a tracer particle within a developing bacterial biofilm using implicit-solvent Brownian dynamics simulations. At these initial stages, bacterial colonies form two-dimensional structures that expand through cell growth and division. Employing an agent-based computational model (IbM), we analyse the passive diffusion of a spherical tracer within colonies of varying compaction levels. Our findings reveal that, at very short timescales, tracer diffusion follows a standard diffusive regime, modulated by colony ageing. However, at longer times, the dominant factor governing tracer motion is colony growth, which effectively confines the tracer within the expanding structure, except in cases where the microcolony is highly unstructured or the tracer is sufficiently small. Additionally, through MR techniques, we quantify the elastic and viscous moduli of the growing microcolony, offering insight into its evolving viscoelastic behavior.</description>

      <title>A continuous damage accumulation scenario for elastomeric frictional wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how materials wear off following frictional sliding is a long-standing question in tribology. In this respect, the particular case of the wear of soft rubbery elastomeric materials stands apart: tire wear produces several million tonnes of abraded materials per year, bearing immense industrial and environmental impact, while the soft nature of elastomers and their inability to accommodate plastic deformation before failure renders their wear mechanisms almost intractable. Here, we harness mechanochemical approaches on model elastomeric materials, to reveal that mild elastomeric wear does not proceed from crack propagation processes, but rather from the continuous accumulation of diffuse damage by chain scission, extending well below the surface of the material. Damage accumulates in a discontinuous manner through micro-slippage events at the rough contacting asperities, with in-depth damage extension set by the characteristic asperity size. Surprisingly, damage grows through a slow logarithmic-like process over successive cycles, which we interpret as the occurrence of stress-activated scission events in a broad strand elastic energy landscape. These observations point to the probabilistic nature of this fatigue-like damage accumulation mechanism and allow us to formulate the wear rate as an integral of the damage cumulated over successive asperity sliding. Finally, by tuning the molecular architecture of our materials, we evidence an antagonistic relation between fracture resistance and wear resilience, set by the sensitivity of the material to stress fluctuations. Revealing the role of previously invisible subsurface damage in elastomeric wear, our approach should stimulate further physical-based approaches allowing for the development of sustainable and wear-resilient materials.</description>

      <title>Mechanical inhibition of dissipation in a thermodynamically consistent active solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of active solids offers a window into the mechanics and thermodynamics of dense living matter. A key aspect of the non-equilibrium dynamics of such active systems is a mechanistic description of how the underlying mechano-chemical couplings arise, which cannot be resolved in models that are phenomenologically constructed. Here, we follow a bottom-up theoretical approach to develop a thermodynamically consistent active solid (TCAS) model, and uncover a non-trivial cross-talk that naturally ensues between mechanical response and dissipation. In particular, we show that dissipation reaches a maximum at finite stresses, while it is inhibited under large stresses, effectively reverting the system to a passive state. Our findings establish a mechanism potentially responsible for the non-monotonic behaviour observed in recent experimental measurements of entropy production rate in an actomyosin material.</description>

      <title>Corner Topology Makes Woven Baskets into Stiff, yet Resilient Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basket weaving is a traditional craft used to create practical three-dimensional (3D) structures. While the geometry and aesthetics of baskets have received considerable attention, the underlying mechanics and modern engineering potential remain underexplored. This work shows that 3D woven structures offer similar stiffness yet substantially higher resilience than their non-woven continuous counterparts. We explore corner topologies that serve as building blocks to convert 2D woven sheets into 3D metamaterials that can carry compressive loads. Under small deformations, the woven corners exhibit axial stiffness similar to continuous structures because the woven ribbons are engaged with in-plane loads. Under large deformations, the woven corners can be compressed repeatedly without plastic damage because ribbons can undergo elastic local buckling. We present a modular platform to assemble woven corners into complex spatial metamaterials and demonstrate applications including damage-resilient robotic systems and metasurfaces with tailorable deformation modes. Our results explain the historic appeal of basket weaving, where readily available ribbons are crafted into 3D structures with comparable stiffness yet far superior resilience to continuous systems. The modular assembly of woven metamaterials can further revolutionize design of next-generation automotive components, consumer devices, soft robots, and more where both resilience and stiffness are essential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between chemotaxis and alignment interactions in active rod-like particles, such as E. coli and Janus rods. Starting from a discrete model of self-propelled rods with chemotactic responses, we employ a Boltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau (BGL) approach to derive coarse-grained dynamical equations for the density, polar and nematic orientational order parameters, and the concentration field of the chemoattractant. We perform a linear stability analysis for fluctuations around uniform steady states corresponding to isotropic and nematic phases. In both phases, we find that translational chemotactic response promotes instability, while rotational chemotactic response suppresses it, elucidating their contrasting effects on the onset of collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Shaping Boundaries to Control and Transport Topological Defects in Colloidal Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic rod-like particles form liquid crystalline phases with varying degrees of orientational and translational order. When confined geometrically, these phases can give rise to topological defects, which can be selected and controlled by tuning how the rods align near boundaries, known as anchoring. While anchoring in molecular liquid crystals can be controlled through surface functionalization, this approach is not easily applicable to microscale colloidal systems, which have so far been limited to planar anchoring. Here, using particle-based simulations, Landau-de Gennes theory, and experiments on colloidal rods, we demonstrate that topographical patterning of the boundary can effectively control the anchoring type and, in turn, the defect state in two-dimensional confined nematics. Building on this, we show that dynamically shape-shifting the boundaries can transform and transport topological defects, enabling the design of liquid crystal analogs for binary information storage.</description>

      <title>Wetting and Pattern Formation in Non-Reciprocal Ternary Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are among the simplest mechanisms that drive a physical system out of thermal equilibrium, leading to novel phenomena such as oscillatory pattern formation. In this paper, we introduce a ternary phase separation model, with non-reciprocal interactions between two of the three phases and a spectator phase that mimics a boundary. Through numerical simulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime, characterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase contact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around the three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring persistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with analytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near equilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical equilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>To Flow or Not To Flow? The granular Bond number to predict clogging in low gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In granular hopper flow, is the clogging probability influenced by gravity? Clogging, the spontaneous arrest of granular flow through a constriction, is a fundamental and widespread phenomenon in granular processing. Accurately predicting clogging risk is essential for space-related activities. Yet, conflicting results leave us without a reliable way to extrapolate terrestrial data to low gravity. We introduce an in-bulk definition of the dimensionless granular Bond number, B, to scale clogging probability from Earth gravity to low gravity. By testing multiple lunar regolith simulants in Earth and Moon gravitational accelerations, using an active drop tower, we reveal that low gravity significantly increases clogging risk, challenging previous findings. We observe a gravity-induced shift in the critical orifice below which clogging occurs by up to one order of magnitude. Scaling data with the Bond number unifies scattered results into a state diagram predicting clogging across materials and gravitational accelerations. Our findings provide a practical tool for anticipating granular clogging in reduced gravity, informing future space missions.</description>

      <title>Role of bubble positioning in force induced melting of DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of bubble positioning in the force-induced melting of double-stranded DNA using two distinct approaches: Brownian Dynamics simulations and the Gaussian Network Model. We isolate the effect of bubble positioning by using DNA molecules with 50% AT - 50% GC base-pair composition which ensures constant enthalpy. Our results reveal that it is not just the sequence itself, but its specific arrangement that influences DNA stability. We examine two types of DNA sequences containing a block of either AT or GC base-pairs, resulting in the formation of a large bubble or a smaller bubble within the DNA, respectively. By systematically shifting these blocks along the strand, we investigate how their positioning influences the force-temperature phase diagram of DNA. Our Brownian dynamics simulations reveal that, at high forces, melting of the entire DNA strand is initiated after stretching $\approx 9$ GC base-pairs, independent of the specific base-pair sequence. In contrast, no such characteristic length scale is observed in the Gaussian network model. Our study suggests that free strand entropy plays a significant role in determining the force-temperature phase diagram of the DNA.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical friction memory leads to subdiffusive configurational dynamics of fast-folding proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins often exhibit subdiffusive configurational dynamics. The origins of this subdiffusion are still unresolved. We investigate the impact of non-Markovian friction and the free energy landscape on the dynamics of fast-folding proteins in terms of the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the mean first-passage-time (MFPT) of the folding reaction coordinate. We find the friction memory kernel from published molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to be well-described by a hierarchical multi-exponential function, which gives rise to subdiffusion in the MSD over a finite range of time. We show that friction memory effects in fast-folding proteins dominate the scaling behavior of the MSD compared to effects due to the folding free energy landscape. As a consequence, Markovian models are insufficient for capturing the folding dynamics, as quantified by the MSD and the MFPT, even when including coordinate-dependent friction. Our results demonstrate the importance of memory effects in protein folding and conformational dynamics and explicitly show that subdiffusion in fast-folding protein dynamics originates from memory effects, not from the free energy landscape and not from coordinate-dependent friction.</description>

      <title>Chelation of the mercury ions by polyethyleneimine: Atomistic molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contamination of water by heavy metal ions represents a significant environmental concern. Among various remediation methods, chelation has proven to be an effective technique in water treatment processes. This study investigates the chelating properties of linear polyethyleneimine (PEI) and its complexation with divalent mercury ions (Hg2+) in aqueous solution. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using the OPLS/AA force field to examine the microscopic structure of PEI-Hg2+ complexes. PEI chains of varying lengths were considered, and it was found that a single linear PEI molecule containing ten amino groups is capable of coordinating up to four Hg2+ ions. The stability of the resulting complexes was further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of electronic band structure of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to calculate the electronic band structure of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se. Ab-initio, calculations are performed in the Atomistix Toolkit program within the Density Functional Theory and Local Spin Density Approximation on Tight Tiger basis. We have used Hubbard U potential $U_{Fe} = 2.42$eV for 3d states for Fe ions. Super-cells of 8 and 64 atoms were constructed. After the construction of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se ($x=$ 6.25%; 25%) super-cells, atom relaxation and optimization of the crystal structure were carried out. Electronic band structure,and density of states were calculated, and total energy have been defined in antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. The band gap for the Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se, $x=0.06$ in ferromagnetic phase is equal to $E_g=1.77$ eV, in antiferromagnetic phase $E_g=1.78$ eV. For $x=0.25$, $E_g=1.92$ eV. Antiferromagnetic phase considered more stable. Our calculations show that the band gap increases with the increases in Fe ion concentration.</description>

      <title>Non-algebraic first return probability of a stretched random walk near a convex boundary and its effect on adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $N$-step random walk, stretched in the vicinity of a disc (in 2D) or a sphere (in 3D) of radius $R$, demonstrates a non-algebraic stretched exponential decay $P_N\sim \exp\left(-{\rm const}\, N^{1/3}\right)$ for the first return probability $P_N$ in the double-scaling limit $N=\frac{L}{a}\gg 1, \frac{R}{a}\gg 1$ conditioned that $\frac{L}{R}=c={\rm const}$. Stretching means that the length of the walk, $L=Na$ (where $a$ is the unit step length) satisfies the condition $L = cR$, where $c &gt; \pi$. Both analytic and numerical evidences of the non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ are provided. Considering the model of a polymer loop stretched ("inflated") by external force, we show that non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ affects the adsorption of a polymer at the boundary of a sticky disc in 2D, manifesting in a first order localization transition.</description>

      <title>Basal layer of granular flow down smooth and rough inclines: kinematics, slip laws and rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular flow down an inclined plane is ubiquitous in geophysical and industrial applications. On rough inclines, the flow exhibits Bagnold's velocity profile and follows the so-called $\mu(I)$ local rheology. On insufficiently rough or smooth inclines, however, velocity slip occurs at the bottom and a basal layer with strong agitation emerges below the bulk, which is not predicted by the local rheology. Here, we use discrete element method simulations to study detailed dynamics of the basal layer in granular flows down both smooth and rough inclines. We control the roughness via a dimensionless parameter, $R_a$, varied systematically from 0 (flat, frictional plane) to near 1 (very rough plane). Three flow regimes are identified: a slip regime ($R_a \lesssim 0.45$) where a dilated basal layer appears, a no-slip regime ($R_a \gtrsim 0.6$) and an intermediate transition regime. In the slip regime, the kinematics profiles (velocity, shear rate and granular temperature) of the basal layer strongly deviate from Bagnold's profiles. General basal slip laws are developed which express the slip velocity as a function of the local shear rate (or granular temperature), base roughness and slope angle. Moreover, the basal layer thickness is insensitive to flow conditions but depends somewhat on the inter-particle coefficient of restitution. Finally, we show that the rheological properties of the basal layer do not follow the $\mu(I)$ rheology, but are captured by Bagnold's stress scaling and an extended kinetic theory for granular flows. Our findings can help develop more predictive granular flow models in the future.</description>

      <title>Size distribution of decaying foam bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most studies on the stability of foam bubbles investigated the mechanical stability of thin films between bubbles due to the drainage by gravity. In the current work, we take an alternative approach by assuming the rupture of bubbles as a series of random events and by investigating the time evolution of the size distribution of foam bubbles over a long time up to several hours. For this purpose, we first prepared layers of bubbles on Petri dishes by shaking soap solutions of a few different concentrations, and then we monitored the Petri dishes by using a time-lapse video imaging technique. We analyzed the captured images by custom software to count the bubble size distribution with respect to the initial concentration and elapsed time. From the statistics on our data, we find that the total bubble volume decreases exponentially in time, and the exponent, i.e. the mean lifetime, is a function of the bubble size. The mean lifetimes of larger bubbles are observed to be shorter than those of smaller bubbles, by approximately a factor of 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend a fractional-dimensional space model for anisotropic solids by incorporating a q-deformed derivative operator, inspired by Tsallis' nonadditive entropy framework. This generalization provides an analytical framework for exploring anisotropic thermal properties, within a unified and flexible mathematical formalism. We derive modified expressions for the phonon density of states and specific heat capacity, highlighting the impact of the deformation parameters on thermodynamic behavior. We apply the model to various solid-state materials, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data, across a wide temperature range and demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing anisotropic and subextensive effects in real systems.</description>

      <title>Challenges and opportunities in piezoelectric polymers: Effect of oriented amorphous fraction in ferroelectric semicrystalline polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on piezoelectric polymers since the discovery of piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in 1969, the fundamental physics of polymer piezoelectricity has remained elusive. Based on the classic principle of piezoelectricity, polymer piezoelectricity should originate from the polar crystalline phase. Surprisingly, the crystal contribution to the piezoelectric strain coefficient d31 is determined to be less than 10%, primarily owing to the difficulty in changing the molecular bond lengths and bond angles. Instead, &gt;85% contribution is from Poisson's ratio, which is closely related to the oriented amorphous fraction (OAF) in uniaxially stretched films of semicrystalline ferroelectric (FE) polymers. In this perspective, the semicrystalline structure-piezoelectric property relationship is revealed using PVDF-based FE polymers as a model system. In melt-processed FE polymers, the OAF is often present and links the crystalline lamellae to the isotropic amorphous fraction. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the electrostrictive conformation transformation of the OAF chains induces a polarization change upon the application of either a stress (the direct piezoelectric effect) or an electric field (the converse piezoelectric effect). Meanwhile, relaxor-like secondary crystals in OAF (SCOAF), which are favored to grow in the extended-chain crystal (ECC) structure, can further enhance the piezoelectricity. However, the ECC structure is difficult to achieve in PVDF homopolymers without high-pressure crystallization. We have discovered that high-power ultrasonication can effectively induce SCOAF in PVDF homopolymers to improve its piezoelectric performance. Finally, we envision that the electrostrictive OAF mechanism should also be applicable for other FE polymers such as odd-numbered nylons and piezoelectric biopolymers.</description>

      <title>Sliding wear: role of plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present experimental wear data for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sliding on tile, sandpaper, and polished steel surfaces, as well as for soda-lime, borosilicate, and quartz glass sliding on sandpaper. The results are compared with a recently developed theory \cite{ToBe} of sliding wear based on crack propagation (fatigue), originally formulated for elastic contact and here extended to include plasticity. The elastoplastic wear model predicts wear rates that agree reasonably well with the experimental results for PMMA and soda-lime glass. However, deviations observed for quartz suggest that material-specific deformation mechanisms, particularly the differences between crystalline and amorphous structures, may need to be considered for accurate wear predictions across different materials. In addition, the model reveals a non-monotonic dependence of the wear rate on the penetration hardness $\sigma_{\rm P}$. Thus, for plastically soft material, the wear rate increases with increasing $\sigma_{\rm P}$, while for hard materials, it decreases. This contrasts with Archard's wear law, where the wear rate decreases monotonically with increasing $\sigma_{\rm P}$.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06958v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.</description>

      <title>Effect of charge regulation on the screening properties of zwitterionic macroion solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precisely controlling the surface charge of zwitterionic macromolecules is crucial for tailoring their properties and optimizing them for specific applications. Here, we present a generalized calculation scheme for determining the screening length in solutions containing zwitterionic macroions, where the charge of the macroion is controlled by the electrolyte solution. This scheme bypasses the need to solve the Poisson Boltzmann equation by expressing the inverse screening parameter in terms of the derivative of pressure with respect to chemical potential. The scheme reveals that the screening length has two components: one related to the Debye length with effective charges, and another stemming from the macroion surface dissociation equilibrium, which exhibits a screening resonance behavior. Furthermore, we find that the nonuniform surface charge distribution induced by pH responsive charge regulation strongly affects the screening behavior. The charge regulation properties of macroions, even in dilute solutions, are a key factor in the screening of electrostatic interactions, offering insights into complex biological and nanomaterial systems.</description>

      <title>Glassy Behavior and Anomalous Transport in Chimney Ladder Crystals Induced by Low-Lying Optical Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowotny chimney ladder (NCL) crystals present physical properties in between the contrasting paradigms of ideal crystal and amorphous solid, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric applications due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. Here, we report an extensive experimental characterization of the thermodynamic and thermoelectric transport properties of a large class of NCL materials, focusing on the intermetallic compound Ru$_2$Sn$_{3}$. We show that the heat capacity of these NCL compounds exhibits a boson-peak-like glassy anomaly between $8$ K and $14$ K. By combining experimental measurements with density functional theory (DFT), we attribute its microscopic origin to extremely low-energy optical phonons that universally appear as a consequence of the chimney ladder sublattice structure. Additionally, the measured thermal conductivity and the thermoelectric response present distinct anomalous glass-like features that strongly correlate with the dynamics of the low-lying optical phonons revealed by DFT. Our work demonstrates that low-energy optical modes in ordered crystals can induce glassy behavior, outlining a pathway to design metallic materials with low thermal conductivity and unique thermoelectric properties without the need for disorder or strong electronic correlations.</description>
