      <title>Validating and monitoring bibliographic and citation data in OpenCitations collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose. The increasing emphasis on data quantity in research infrastructures has highlighted the need for equally robust mechanisms ensuring data quality, particularly in bibliographic and citation datasets. This paper addresses the challenge of maintaining high-quality open research information within OpenCitations, a community-guided Open Science Infrastructure, by introducing tools for validating and monitoring bibliographic metadata and citation data.
  Methods. We developed a custom validation tool tailored to the OpenCitations Data Model (OCDM), designed to detect and explain ingestion errors from heterogeneous sources, whether due to upstream data inconsistencies or internal software bugs. Additionally, a quality monitoring tool was created to track known data issues post-publication. These tools were applied in two scenarios: (1) validating metadata and citations from Matilda, a potential future source, and (2) monitoring data quality in the existing OpenCitations Meta dataset.
  Results. The validation tool successfully identified a variety of structural and semantic issues in the Matilda dataset, demonstrating its precision. The monitoring tool enabled the detection of recurring problems in the OpenCitations Meta collection, as well as their quantification. Together, these tools proved effective in enhancing the reliability of OpenCitations' published data.
  Conclusion. The presented validation and monitoring tools represent a step toward ensuring high-quality bibliographic data in open research infrastructures, though they are limited to the data model adopted by OpenCitations. Future developments are aimed at expanding to additional data sources, with particular regard to crowdsourced data.</description>

      <title>Language and Knowledge Representation: A Stratified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thesis proposes the problem of representation heterogeneity to emphasize the fact that heterogeneity is an intrinsic property of any representation, wherein, different observers encode different representations of the same target reality in a stratified manner using different concepts, language and knowledge (as well as data). The thesis then advances a top-down solution approach to the above stratified problem of representation heterogeneity in terms of several solution components, namely: (i) a representation formalism stratified into concept level, language level, knowledge level and data level to accommodate representation heterogeneity, (ii) a top-down language representation using Universal Knowledge Core (UKC), UKC namespaces and domain languages to tackle the conceptual and language level heterogeneity, (iii) a top-down knowledge representation using the notions of language teleontology and knowledge teleontology to tackle the knowledge level heterogeneity, (iv) the usage and further development of the existing LiveKnowledge catalog for enforcing iterative reuse and sharing of language and knowledge representations, and, (v) the kTelos methodology integrating the solution components above to iteratively generate the language and knowledge representations absolving representation heterogeneity. The thesis also includes proof-of-concepts of the language and knowledge representations developed for two international research projects - DataScientia (data catalogs) and JIDEP (materials modelling). Finally, the thesis concludes with future lines of research.</description>

      <title>Socio-cognitive Networks between Researchers: Investigating Scientific Dualities with the Group-Oriented Relational Hyperevent Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding why researchers cite certain works remains a key question in the study of scientific networks. Prior research has identified factors such as relevance, group cohesion, and source crediting. However, the interplay between cognitive and social dimensions in citation behavior - often conceptualized as a socio-cognitive network - is frequently overlooked, particularly regarding the intermediary steps that lead to a citation. Since a citation first requires a work to be published by a set of authors, we examine how the structure of coauthorship networks influences citation patterns. To investigate this relationship, we analyze the citation and collaboration behavior of Chilean astronomers from 2013 to 2015 using the Group-Oriented Relational Hyperevent Model, which allows us to study coauthorship and citation networks in a joint framework. Our findings suggest that when selecting which works to cite, authors favor recent research and maintain cognitive continuity across cited works. At the same time, we observe that coherent groups - closely connected coauthors - tend to be co-cited more frequently in subsequent publications, reinforcing the interdependence of collaboration and citation networks.</description>
