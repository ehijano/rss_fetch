      <title>Anisotropic and non-additive interactions of a Rydberg impurity in a quantum bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for treating anisotropic and non-additive impurity-bath interactions - features that are ubiquitous in realistic quantum impurity problems, but are often neglected in conventional approaches relying on additive, spherically symmetric pseudopotentials. To illustrate this, we focus on a Rydberg atom immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, where the internal-state degeneracy of the Rydberg impurity gives rise to configuration-dependent non-additive potentials. With increasing interaction strength, anisotropy-induced partial-wave mixing generates distinct polaron and molaron resonances, allowing for radially and angularly excited bound states to become accessible. This approach captures the anisotropy and non-additivity characteristic of a Rydberg impurity immersed in a quantum bath, and provides broad applicability to a host of quantum impurity problems beyond the Fr\"ohlich paradigm.</description>

      <title>Quench Dynamics and Stability of Dark Solitons in Exciton Polariton Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton polariton condensates (EPCs) have emerged as a paradigmatic platform for investigating nonequilibrium quantum many-body phenomena, particularly due to their intrinsic open-dissipative nature and strong nonlinear interactions governed by the interplay between stimulated scattering and reservoir-mediated damping. Recent advances in Feshbach resonance engineering now enable precise tuning of interaction strengths, opening new avenues to explore exotic nonlinear excitations in these driven-dissipative systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the quench dynamics and stability of dark solitons in repulsive one-dimensional EPCs under sudden parameter variations in both nonlinear interaction strength g and pump intensity P. Through a Hamiltonian variational approach that incorporates reservoir damping effects, we derive reduced equations of motion for soliton velocity evolution that exhibit remarkable qualitative agreement with direct numerical simulations of the underlying open-dissipative Gross Pitaevskii equation. Our results reveal three distinct dynamical regimes: (i) stable soliton propagation at intermediate pump powers, (ii) velocity-dependent soliton breakup above critical pumping thresholds, and (iii) parametric excitation of soliton trains under simultaneous interaction quenches. These findings establish a quantitative framework for understanding soliton dynamics in nonresonantly pumped EPCs, with implications for quantum fluid dynamics and nonequilibrium Bose Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Topological interactions in vortex-wave collisions in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study vortex-vortex and vortex-wave collisions in two-dimensional weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates, processes that play a central role in decaying quantum turbulence. Using numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we show that during collisions of vortex-antivortex dipoles, the kinetic energy is transferred from incompressible to compressible modes by two distinct mechanisms. Below the critical vortex separation for annihilation, the transfer is mediated by quantum energy released during annihilation events, while above the threshold it arises from vortex acceleration. In wave-vortex collisions, an incoming solitary wave splits into transient phase slips that interact with the vortex, one of the phase slips contributes to vortex annihilation, and the other phase slip acquires a stable core and forms a new vortex. By analyzing vortex trajectories and energy spectra, we provide new insights into energy transfer mechanisms in quantum turbulence and offer broader implications for topological interactions mediated by vortices.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in quantum-enhanced metrological protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness (colloquially "magic") characterizes genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) operations necessary for preparation of quantum states, and can be measured by stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). For permutationally symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems, only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators. This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols, which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT), the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces metrologically useful "kitten" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller, system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness, multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to open quantum systems with long-range competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competition between short- and long-range interactions underpins many emergent phenomena in nature. Despite rapid progress in their experimental control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce. Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms, ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.</description>

      <title>The (PXP)$^2$ model: long-range quantum scars in optical cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg-cavity systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. These hybrid architectures combine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate collective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong short-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering many-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely different length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable model for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we restrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a kinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This approach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime of strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent framework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range interactions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and N\'eel-ordered phases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase, distinct from the conventional superradiant phase. Out of equilibrium, we identify long-range quantum many-body scars, which are atypical nonthermal eigenstates that evade the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and giving rise to slow entanglement growth. In contrast to the linear-in-time entanglement growth characteristic of short-range scarred models, these long-range scars exhibit logarithmic entanglement dynamics. Our results establish a minimal yet versatile framework for Rydberg-cavity systems, and provide a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental studies of this frontier platform in quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Hyperspherical Analysis of Dimer-Dimer Scattering in One-Dimensional Systems</title>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of four-body scattering in one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation (AHR). Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fragmented Dopant Dynamics in Quantum Spin Lattices: Robust Localization and non-Gaussian Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, which increases exponentially with decreasing temperature. The dopant, hereby, only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes at rate $\alpha$, the dopant diffuses with a diffusion coefficient, $D_h$, depending non-monotonically on $\alpha$. It initially increases linearly as $D_h \propto \alpha$ for $\alpha \ll 1$ before dropping off as $\alpha^{-1}$ for $\alpha &gt; 1$. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics features self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion, especially for weak spin exchange. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient $D_h$ follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it is exponentially suppressed upon cooling.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-Hermiticity using single- and many-particle quantum properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian paradigm of quantum systems displays salient features drastically different from Hermitian counterparts. In this work, we focus on one such aspect, the difference of evolving quantum ensembles under $H_{\mathrm{nh}}$ (right ensemble) versus its Hermitian conjugate, $H_{\mathrm{nh}}^{\dagger}$ (left ensemble). We propose a formalism that quantifies the (dis-)similarity of these right and left ensembles, for single- as well as many-particle quantum properties. Such a comparison gives us a scope to measure the extent to which non-Hermiticity gets translated from the Hamiltonian into physically observable properties. We test the formalism in two cases: First, we construct a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian using a set of imperfect Bell states, showing that the non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian does not automatically comply with the non-Hermiticity at the level of observables. Second, we study the interacting Hatano--Nelson model with asymmetric hopping as a paradigmatic quantum many-body Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we identify situations where the measures of non-Hermiticity computed for the Hamiltonian, for single-, and for many-particle quantum properties behave distinctly from each other. Thus, different notions of non-Hermiticity can become useful in different physical scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the measures can qualitatively mark the model's Parity--Time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition. Our findings can be instrumental in unveiling new exotic quantum phases of non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems as well as in preparing resourceful states for quantum technologies.</description>
