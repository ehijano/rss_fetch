      <title>Exact Algorithms for Multiagent Path Finding with Communication Constraints on Tree-Like Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08556v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the scenario where multiple agents have to move in an optimal way through a network, each one towards their ending position while avoiding collisions. By optimal, we mean as fast as possible, which is evaluated by a measure known as the makespan of the proposed solution. This is the setting studied in the Multiagent Path Finding problem. In this work, we additionally provide the agents with a way to communicate with each other. Due to size constraints, it is reasonable to assume that the range of communication of each agent will be limited. What should be the trajectories of the agents to, additionally, maintain a backbone of communication? In this work, we study the Multiagent Path Finding with Communication Constraint problem under the parameterized complexity framework.
  Our main contribution is three exact algorithms that are efficient when considering particular structures for the input network. We provide such algorithms for the case when the communication range and the number of agents (the makespan resp.) are provided in the input and the network has a tree topology, or bounded maximum degree (has a tree-like topology, i.e., bounded treewidth resp.). We complement these results by showing that it is highly unlikely to construct efficient algorithms when considering the number of agents as part of the input, even if the makespan is $3$ and the communication range is $1$.</description>

      <title>Simple Norm Bounds for Polynomial Random Matrices via Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for obtaining norm bounds for random matrices, where each entry is a low-degree polynomial in an underlying set of independent real-valued random variables. Such matrices arise in a variety of settings in the analysis of spectral and optimization algorithms, which require understanding the spectrum of a random matrix depending on data obtained as independent samples.
  Using ideas of decoupling and linearization from analysis, we show a simple way of expressing norm bounds for such matrices, in terms of matrices of lower-degree polynomials corresponding to derivatives. Iterating this method gives a simple bound with an elementary proof, which can recover many bounds previously required more involved techniques.</description>

      <title>Parameterised Complexity of Consistent Query Answering via Graph Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study consistent query answering via different graph representations. First, we introduce solution-conflict hypergraphs in which nodes represent facts and edges represent either conflicts or query solutions. Considering a monotonic query and a set of antimonotonic constraints, we present an explicit algorithm for counting the number of repairs satisfying the query based on a tree decomposition of the solution-conflict hypergraph. The algorithm not only provides fixed-parameter tractability results for data complexity over expressive query and constraint classes, but also introduces a novel and potentially implementable approach to repair counting. Second, we consider the Gaifman graphs arising from MSO descriptions of consistent query answering. Using a generalization of Courcelle's theorem, we then present fixed-parameter tractability results for combined complexity over expressive query and constraint classes.</description>

      <title>Randomized Lower Bounds for Tarski Fixed Points in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Knaster-Tarski theorem, also known as Tarski's theorem, guarantees that every monotone function defined on a complete lattice has a fixed point. We analyze the query complexity of finding such a fixed point on the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$ under the $\leq$ relation. Specifically, there is an unknown monotone function $f: \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k \to \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k$ and an algorithm must query a vertex $v$ to learn $f(v)$.
  A key special case of interest is the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^k$, which is isomorphic to the power set lattice -- the original setting of the Knaster-Tarski theorem. Our lower bound characterizes the randomized and deterministic query complexity of the Tarski search problem on the Boolean hypercube as $\Theta(k)$. More generally, we prove a randomized lower bound of $\Omega\left( k + \frac{k \cdot \log{n}}{\log{k}} \right)$ for the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$, which is asymptotically tight in high dimensions when $k$ is large relative to $n$.</description>

      <title>Randomized Communication and Implicit Graph Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the focused study of constant-cost randomized communication, with emphasis on its connection to graph representations. We observe that constant-cost randomized communication problems are equivalent to hereditary (i.e. closed under taking induced subgraphs) graph classes which admit constant-size adjacency sketches and probabilistic universal graphs (PUGs), which are randomized versions of the well-studied adjacency labeling schemes and induced-universal graphs. This gives a new perspective on long-standing questions about the existence of these objects, including new methods of constructing adjacency labeling schemes.
  We ask three main questions about constant-cost communication, or equivalently, constant-size PUGs: (1) Are there any natural, non-trivial problems aside from Equality and k-Hamming Distance which have constant-cost communication? We provide a number of new examples, including deciding whether two vertices have path-distance at most k in a planar graph, and showing that constant-size PUGs are preserved by the Cartesian product operation. (2) What structures of a problem explain the existence or non-existence of a constant-cost protocol? We show that in many cases a Greater-Than subproblem is such a structure. (3) Is the Equality problem complete for constant-cost randomized communication? We show that it is not: there are constant-cost problems which do not reduce to Equality.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Classical Simulation of Noisy Circuits with Naturally Fault-Tolerant Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the output distribution of low-depth noisy Clifford circuits with any product-state inputs and final single-qubit measurements in any basis. This class of circuits includes Clifford-magic circuits and Conjugated-Clifford circuits, which are important candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage using non-universal gates. Additionally, our results generalize a simulation algorithm for IQP circuits [Rajakumar et. al, SODA'25] to the case of IQP circuits augmented with CNOT gates, which is another class of non-universal circuits that are relevant to current experiments. Importantly, our results do not require randomness assumptions over the circuit families considered (such as anticoncentration properties) and instead hold for every circuit in each class. This allows us to place tight limitations on the robustness of these circuits to noise. In particular, we show that there is no quantum advantage at large depths with realistically noisy Clifford circuits, even with perfect magic state inputs, or IQP circuits with CNOT gates, even with arbitrary diagonal non-Clifford gates. The key insight behind the algorithm is that interspersed noise causes a decay of long-range entanglement, and at depths beyond a critical threshold, the noise builds up to an extent that most correlations can be classically simulated. To prove our results, we merge techniques from percolation theory with tools from Pauli path analysis.</description>
