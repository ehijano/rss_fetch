      <title>Optimisation of the Accelerator Control by Reinforcement Learning: A Simulation-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing accelerator control is a critical challenge in experimental particle physics, requiring significant manual effort and resource expenditure. Traditional tuning methods are often time-consuming and reliant on expert input, highlighting the need for more efficient approaches. This study aims to create a simulation-based framework integrated with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address these challenges. Using \texttt{Elegant} as the simulation backend, we developed a Python wrapper that simplifies the interaction between RL algorithms and accelerator simulations, enabling seamless input management, simulation execution, and output analysis.
  The proposed RL framework acts as a co-pilot for physicists, offering intelligent suggestions to enhance beamline performance, reduce tuning time, and improve operational efficiency. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the application of our RL approach to an accelerator control problem and highlight the improvements in efficiency and performance achieved through our methodology. We discuss how the integration of simulation tools with a Python-based RL framework provides a powerful resource for the accelerator physics community, showcasing the potential of machine learning in optimizing complex physical systems.</description>

      <title>Analytical theory of the skewed wake effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental discovery of a new type of wakefield effect, the "skewed wake effect", has been reported. We provide an explanation of the nature of the skewed wake effect based on a simple three-particle model that we have developed. Taking a step forward, we analyze this effect for the case of a highly elliptical beam, provide a simple estimate of the skew angle, and analyze the wake amplitude effects associated with this effect.</description>

      <title>Short-Pulse Driven Radiofrequency X-Band Photoinjector: Electromagnetic Properties and Beam Dynamics in the Transient Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the radiofrequency (RF) characteristics and beam dynamics of an X-band photogun (Xgun) operating in the transient state. The photoinjector is designed to operate with short RF pulses (9 ns) to achieve high accelerating gradients. Short-pulse operation potentially reduces breakdown risks, as experimentally demonstrated by achieving a gradient exceeding 350 MV/m. However, the short pulse duration causes the cavity to operate in a transient regime where the electromagnetic field deviates from the conventional steady-state condition. To investigate the effects of deviations from steady-state operation, the time-dependent spatial evolution of the cavity fields was examined using both 9-ns and 50-ns RF pulses. The 50-ns pulse served as a reference to characterize the cavity behavior under a fully filled steady-state condition. Beam dynamics simulations were conducted to explore the impact of transient RF effects on beam kinetic energy, transverse emittance, and bunch length; these simulations employed a new dynamic field mapping approach to model transient RF fields.</description>
