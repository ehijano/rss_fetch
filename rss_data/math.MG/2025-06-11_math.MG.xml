      <title>Fixed Points of Meir-Keeler and Leader Contractions with bounded orbits in b-Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish fixed-point theorems for Meir-Keeler-type contractions in b-metric spaces. While Lu et al. demonstrated via an explicit counterexample that classical Meir-Keeler contractions may fail to admit fixed points in this setting, we prove that a natural strengthening of the conditions yields existence results. Specifically, we show that every non-expansive Leader contraction with bounded orbits in a b-metric space possesses a fixed point.
  To contextualize our findings, we present a hierarchical diagram illustrating that the fixed-point theory of non-expansive Leader contractions subsumes earlier results, including Meir-Keeler contractions, the primary focus of this work. Our proofs hold in arbitrary b-metric spaces, without relying on the triangle inequality, requiring instead only the assumption of unique limits.
  This work not only resolves the limitation exposed by Lu et al.'s counterexample but also establishes a unifying framework for future research in the literature.</description>

      <title>Balanced quasistatic evolutions of critical points in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasistatic evolutions of critical points of time-dependent energies exhibit piecewise smooth behavior, making them useful for modeling continuum mechanics phenomena like elastic-plasticity and fracture. Traditionally, such evolutions have been derived as vanishing viscosity and inertia limits, leading to balanced viscosity solutions. However, for nonconvex energies, these constructions have been realized in Euclidean spaces and assume non-degenerate critical points. In this paper, we take a different approach by decoupling the time scales of the energy evolution and of the transition to equilibria. Namely, starting from an equilibrium configuration, we let the energy evolve, while keeping frozen the system state; then, we update the state by freezing the energy, while letting the system transit via gradient flow or an approximation of it (e.g., minimizing movement or backward differentiation schemes). This approach has several advantages. It aligns with the physical principle that systems transit through energy-minimizing steady states. It is also fully constructive and computationally implementable, with physical and computational costs governed by appropriate action functionals. Additionally, our analysis is simpler and more general than previous formulations in the literature, as it does not require non-degenerate critical points. Finally, this approach extends to evolutions in locally compact metric path spaces, and our axiomatic presentation allows for various realizations.</description>

      <title>Spherical sets avoiding orthonormal bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exists an absolute constant $c_0&lt;1$ such that for all $n \ge 2$, any measurable set $A \subset S^{n-1}$ of density at least $c_0$ contains $n$ pairwise orthogonal vectors. The result is sharp up to the value of the constant $c_0$.
  Moreover, we show that for all $2\le k \le n$ a set $A$ avoiding $k$ pairwise orthogonal vectors has measure at most $\exp(-c_1 \min\{\sqrt{n}, n/k\})$ for some $c_1&gt;0$. Proofs rely on the harmonic analysis on the sphere and the hypercontractive inequality.</description>

Abstract: In this work we prove the Stepanov differentiation theorem for multiple-valued functions. This theorem is proved in the wide generality of metric-space-multiple-valued functions without relying on a Lipschitz extension result. General definitions of differentiability and approximate differentiability for functions between suitable metric spaces are also introduced.</description>

      <title>Friedman-Ramanujan functions in random hyperbolic geometry and application to spectral gaps II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The core focus of this series of two articles is the study of the distribution of the length spectrum of closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$, sampled randomly with respect to the Weil-Petersson probability measure. In the first article, we introduced a notion of local topological type $T$, and established the existence of a density function $V_g^T(l)$ describing the distribution of the lengths of all closed geodesics of type $T$ in a genus $g$ hyperbolic surface. We proved that $V_g^{T}(l)$ admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/g$. We introduced a new class of functions, called Friedman-Ramanujan functions, and related it to the study of the spectral gap $\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian.
  In this second part, we provide a variety of new tools allowing to compute and estimate the volume functions $V_g^{T}(l)$. Notably, we construct new sets of coordinates on Teichm\"uller spaces, distinct from Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates, in which the Weil-Petersson volume has a simple form. These coordinates are tailored to the geodesics we study, and we can therefore prove nice formulae for their lengths. We use these new ideas, together with a notion of pseudo-convolutions, to prove that the coefficients of the expansion of $V_g^{T}(l)$ in powers of $1/g$ are Friedman-Ramanujan functions, for any local topological type $T$. We then exploit this result to prove that, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, $\lambda_1 \geq \frac14 - \epsilon$ with probability going to one as $g \rightarrow + \infty$, or, in other words, typical hyperbolic surfaces have an asymptotically optimal spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic area measures of convex bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the relative differential geometry, where the Euclidean normal vector of hypersurfaces is generalized by a relative normalization, we introduce anisotropic area measures of convex bodies, constructed with respect to a gauge body. Together with the anisotropic curvature measures, they are special cases of the newly introduced anisotropic support measures. We show that a convex body in ${\mathbb R}^n$, for which the anisotropic area measure of some order $k\in\{0,\dots,n-2\}$ is proportional to the area measure of order $n-1$, must be a $k$-tangential body of the gauge body.</description>

      <title>Piecewise-linear embeddings of the space of 3D lattices into $\RR^{13}$ for high-throughput handling of lattice parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two methods to continuously and piecewise-linearly parametrize rank-3 lattices by vectors of $\RR^{13}$, which provides an efficient way to judge if two sets of parameters provide nearly identical lattices within their margins of errors. Such a parametrization can be used to speed up scientific computing involving periodic structures in $\RR^3$ such as crystal structures, which includes database querying, detection of duplicate entries, and structure generation via deep learning techniques. One gives a novel application of Conway's vonorms and conorms, and another is achieved through a natural extension of Ry{\u s}hkov's $C$-type to the setting modulo $3$. Voronoi vectors modulo 3 obtained in the latter approach provide an algorithm for enumerating of all potential isometries under perturbations of lattice parameters.</description>

      <title>Coarse obstructions to cocompact cubulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide geometric methods to give bounds on the large-scale dimension of CAT(0) cube complexes quasiisometric to a given group $G$. In situations where these bounds conflict we obtain obstructions to $G$ being cocompactly cubulated. More strongly, the obstructions prevent $G$ from being a coarse median space.
  As applications, we show that many free-by-cyclic groups cannot be cocompactly cubulated, even virtually, and prove that any tubular group with a coarse median is virtually compact special. We also exhibit a group that is CAT(0), $C(6)$, and virtually special, yet is not quasiisometric to any CAT(0) cube complex. This is the first example of a $C(6)$ group that cannot be cocompactly cubulated, resolving a question of Jankiewicz and partially answering a question of Wise.</description>

      <title>Fixed and Periodic Points of the Intersection Body Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08171v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intersection body $IK$ of a star-body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ was introduced by E. Lutwak following the work of H. Busemann, and plays a central role in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. We show that when $n \geq 3$, $I^2 K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered ellipsoid, and hence $I K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered Euclidean ball, answering long-standing questions by Lutwak, Gardner, and Fish-Nazarov-Ryabogin-Zvavitch. To this end, we recast the iterated intersection body equation as an Euler-Lagrange equation for a certain volume functional under radial perturbations, derive new formulas for the volume of $I K$, and introduce a continuous version of Steiner symmetrization for Lipschitz star-bodies, which (surprisingly) yields a useful radial perturbation exactly when $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Failure of the measure contraction property via quotients in higher-step sub-Riemannian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the synthetic Ricci curvature lower bound known as the measure contraction property (MCP) can fail in sub-Riemannian geometry. This may happen beyond step two, if the distance function is not Lipschitz in charts, and it already occurs in fundamental examples such as the Martinet and Engel structures.
  Central to our analysis are new results, of independent interest, on the stability of the local MCP under quotients by isometric group actions for general metric measure spaces, developed under a weaker variant of the essential non-branching condition which, in contrast with the classical one, is implied by the minimizing Sard property in sub-Riemannian geometry.
  As an application, we find sub-Riemannian structures with pre-medium-fat distribution that do not satisfy the MCP, answering a question raised in [L. Rifford, J. \'Ec. polytech. Math. 2023]. Finally, and quite unexpectedly, we show that ideal sub-Riemannian structures can fail the MCP, and this actually happens generically for rank greater than 3 and high dimension.</description>

      <title>Constructing Two Metrics for Spencer Cohomology: Hodge Decomposition of Constrained Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a metric framework for Spencer complexes based on the geometric theory of compatible pairs $(D,\lambda)$ in principal bundle constraint systems, solving fundamental technical problems in computing Spencer cohomology of constraint systems. We develop two complementary and geometrically natural metric schemes: a tensor metric based on constraint strength weighting and an induced metric arising from principal bundle curvature geometry, both maintaining deep compatibility with the strong transversality structure of compatible pairs. Through establishing the corresponding Spencer-Hodge decomposition theory, we rigorously prove that both metrics provide complete elliptic structures for Spencer complexes, thereby guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness and finite-dimensionality of Hodge decompositions. It reveals that the strong transversality condition of compatible pairs is not only a necessary property of constraint geometry, but also key to the elliptic regularity of Spencer operators, while the introduction of constraint strength functions and curvature weights provides natural weighting mechanisms for metric structures that coordinate with the intrinsic geometry of constraint systems. This theory tries to unify the differential geometric methods of constraint mechanics, cohomological analysis tools of gauge field theory, and classical techniques of Hodge theory in differential topology, establishing a mathematical foundation for understanding and computing topological invariants of complex constraint systems.</description>
