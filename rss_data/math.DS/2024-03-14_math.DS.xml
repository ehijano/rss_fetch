      <title>Intersection of a Moran type Sierpinski carpet and a line with rational slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2005, Liu et al. calculated the dimensionality of the intersection of Sierpinski carpet and a straight line with rational slope in the sense of Lebesgue measure.Sierpinski carpet is a self-similar set in two-dimensional planes obtained by an iterative function system, so each layer has the same structure. While the Sierpinski carpet set with Moran structure is the limit set obtained by the action of two iterative function systems in the two-dimensional plane, which we denote as ~$F_{\sigma}$~. And the structure of each layer may be different, controlled by 0,1 sequence ~$\sigma$~ and controlled by the set. In this paper, the upper and lower box dimensions of the set ~$F_{\sigma}$~ and the straight line ~$L_{a}$~ with rational slope are calculated, where ~$a$~ is the intercept of the straight line. In addition, we consider some related problem. The main difficulty in the research is that the structure of each layer of the set ~$F_{\sigma}$~ may be different, so the structure of each layer needs to be considered with the help of the sequence ~$\sigma$~ in the calculation process.</description>

      <title>Surfaces and other Peano Continua with no Generic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of chains on a compact connected space encodes all the different ways of continuously growing out of a point until exhausting the space. A chain is generic if its orbit under the action of the underlying homeomorphism group is comeager: a space X has a generic chain if there is essentially just one type of chain on X. Gutman, Tsankov and Zucker proved that compact manifolds of dimension at least 3 do not have a generic chain. We extend and generalize their result, covering a large class of spaces which includes all compact surfaces except for the sphere and the real projective plane - for which the question remains open - as well as all other homogeneous Peano continua, circle excluded. If the spaces are moreover strongly locally homogeneous, which is the case for any closed manifold as well as the Menger curve, we prove that chains cannot be classified up to homeomorphism by countable structures, and that the underlying homomorphism groups have non-metrizable universal minimal flows. This is in contrast with the case of 1-dimensional manifolds: their homomorphism groups have metrizable universal minimal flow and we show that their chains are classifiable by countable structures and have a generic element. The proof of the main result relies on crafting a dictionary between open sets of chains on one side, and walks on finite connected graphs on the other. We then establish a novel combinatorial necessary condition for the existence of a generic chain, an off-by-one weak amalgamation principle, and prove that it is not satisfied under the hypotheses of our theorem.</description>

      <title>Poisson suspensions without roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct rigid Poisson suspensions without roots. The discrete rational component in spectrum of an ergodic automorphism S prevents some roots from existing. If S is tensorly multiplied by an ergodic automorphism of the space with a sigma-finite measure, discrete spectrum disappears in this product, but like the smile of Cheshire Cat, the memory of it can remain in the form of the absence of roots. In additional conditions, this effect is inherited by the Poisson suspension over the above product. Starting from this idea, but without using the tensor product, we describe simple rank-one constructions for which the Poisson suspensions are rigid and have no roots.</description>

      <title>Supervised Time Series Classification for Anomaly Detection in Subsea Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series classification is of significant importance in monitoring structural systems. In this work, we investigate the use of supervised machine learning classification algorithms on simulated data based on a physical system with two states: Intact and Broken. We provide a comprehensive discussion of the preprocessing of temporal data, using measures of statistical dispersion and dimension reduction techniques. We present an intuitive baseline method and discuss its efficiency. We conclude with a comparison of the various methods based on different performance metrics, showing the advantage of using machine learning techniques as a tool in decision making.</description>

      <title>A Computational Method for $H_2$-optimal Estimator and State Feedback Controller Synthesis for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present solvable, convex formulations of $H_2$-optimal state estimation and state-feedback control problems for a general class of linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with one spatial dimension. These convex formulations are derived by using an analysis and control framework called the `Partial Integral Equation' (PIE) framework, which utilizes the PIE representation of infinite-dimensional systems. Since PIEs are parameterized by Partial Integral (PI) operators that form an algebra, $H_2$-optimal estimation and control problems for PIEs can be formulated as Linear PI Inequalities (LPIs). Furthermore, if a PDE admits a PIE representation, then the stability and $H_2$ performance of the PIE system implies that of the PDE system. Consequently, the optimal estimator and controller obtained for a PIE using LPIs provide the same stability and performance when applied to the corresponding PDE. These LPI optimization problems can be solved computationally using semi-definite programming solvers because such problems can be formulated using Linear Matrix Inequalities by using positive matrices to parameterize a cone of positive PI operators. We illustrate the application of these methods by constructing observers and controllers for some standard PDE examples.</description>

      <title>Weak Collocation Regression for Inferring Stochastic Dynamics with L\'{e}vy Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid increase of observational, experimental and simulated data for stochastic systems, tremendous efforts have been devoted to identifying governing laws underlying the evolution of these systems. Despite the broad applications of non-Gaussian fluctuations in numerous physical phenomena, the data-driven approaches to extracting stochastic dynamics with L\'{e}vy noise are relatively few. In this work, we propose a Weak Collocation Regression (WCR) to explicitly reveal unknown stochastic dynamical systems, i.e., the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) with both $\alpha$-stable L\'{e}vy noise and Gaussian noise, from discrete aggregate data. This method utilizes the evolution equation of the probability distribution function, i.e., the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. With the weak form of the FP equation, the WCR constructs a linear system of unknown parameters where all integrals are evaluated by Monte Carlo method with the observations. Then, the unknown parameters are obtained by a sparse linear regression. For a SDE with L\'{e}vy noise, the corresponding FP equation is a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE), which contains nonlocal terms, and is difficult to deal with. The weak form can avoid complicated multiple integrals. Our approach can simultaneously distinguish mixed noise types, even in multi-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is accurate and computationally efficient.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a modified damped version of H\'enon-Heiles system and investigate its integrability. By extending the Painlev\'e analysis of ordinary differential equations we find that the modified H\'enon-Heiles system possesses the Painlev\'e property for three distinct parametric restrictions. For each of the identified cases, we construct two independent integrals of motion using the well known Prelle-Singer method. We then derive a set of nontrivial non-point symmetries for each of the identified integrable cases of the modified H\'enon-Heiles system. We infer that the modified H\'enon-Heiles system is integrable for three distinct parametric restrictions. Exact solutions are given explicitly for two integrable cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.03713v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the dynamical properties of delayed complex balanced systems. We first study the relationship between the stoichiometric compatibility classes of delayed and non-delayed systems. Using this relation we give another way to derive the existence of positive equilibrium in each stoichiometric compatibility class for delayed complex balanced systems. And if time delays are constant, the result can be generalized to weakly reversible networks. Also, by utilizing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, we can obtain a long-time dynamical property about $\omega$-limit set of the complex balanced system with constant time delays. An example is also provided to support our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.15133v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dimension theory of limit sets of iterated function systems consisting of a countably infinite number of contractions. Our primary focus is on the intermediate dimensions: a family of dimensions depending on a parameter $\theta \in [0,1]$ which interpolate between the Hausdorff and box dimensions. Our main results are in the case when all the contractions are conformal. Under a natural separation condition we prove that the intermediate dimensions of the limit set are the maximum of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and the intermediate dimensions of the set of fixed points of the contractions. This builds on work of Mauldin and Urba\'nski concerning the Hausdorff and upper box dimension. We give several (often counter-intuitive) applications of our work to dimensions of projections, fractional Brownian images, and general H\"older images. These applications apply to well-studied examples such as sets of numbers which have real or complex continued fraction expansions with restricted entries.
  We also obtain several results without assuming conformality or any separation conditions. We prove general upper bounds for the Hausdorff, box and intermediate dimensions of infinitely generated attractors in terms of a topological pressure function. We also show that the limit set of a 'generic' infinite iterated function system has box and intermediate dimensions equal to the ambient spatial dimension, where 'generic' can mean either 'full measure' or 'comeagre.'</description>

Abstract: We study the dimension theory of limit sets of iterated function systems consisting of a countably infinite number of conformal contractions. Our focus is on the Assouad type dimensions, which give information about the local structure of sets. Under natural separation conditions, we prove a formula for the Assouad dimension and prove sharp bounds for the Assouad spectrum in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and dimensions of the set of fixed points of the contractions. The Assouad spectra of the family of examples which we use to show that the bounds are sharp display interesting behaviour, such as having two phase transitions. Our results apply in particular to sets of real or complex numbers which have continued fraction expansions with restricted entries, and to certain parabolic attractors.</description>

Abstract: The Lyapunov exponent is well-known in deterministic dynamical systems as a measure for quantifying chaos and detecting coherent regions in physically evolving systems. In this Letter, we show how the Lyapunov exponent can be unified with stochastic sensitivity (which quantifies the uncertainty of an evolving uncertain system whose initial condition is certain) within a finite time uncertainty quantification framework in which both the dynamics and the initial condition of a continuously evolving $ n $-dimensional state variable are uncertain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.08679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any given density matrix can be represented as an infinite number of ensembles of pure states. This leads to the natural question of how to uniquely select one out of the many, apparently equally suitable, possibilities. Following Jaynes' information-theoretic perspective, this can be framed as an inference problem. We propose the Maximum Geometric Quantum Entropy Principle to exploit the notions of Quantum Information Dimension and Geometric Quantum Entropy. These allow us to quantify the entropy of fully arbitrary ensembles and select the one that maximizes it. After formulating the principle mathematically, we give the analytical solution to the maximization problem in a number of cases and discuss the physical mechanism behind the emergence of such maximum entropy ensembles.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Partial Integral Equation Representation to GPDE Input-Output Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that the existence of a Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation of a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) simplifies many numerical aspects of analysis, simulation, and optimal control. However, the PIE representation has not previously been extended to many of the complex, higher-order PDEs such as may be encountered in speculative or data-based models. In this paper, we propose PIE representations for a large class of such PDE models, including higher-order derivatives, boundary-valued inputs, and coupling with Ordinary Differential Equations. The main technical contribution which enables this extension is a generalization of Cauchy's rule for repeated integration. The process of conversion of a complex PDE model to a PIE is simplified through a PDE modeling interface in the open-source software PIETOOLS. Several numerical tests and illustrations are used to demonstrate the results.</description>

      <title>Equitable Data-Driven Facility Location and Resource Allocation to Fight the Opioid Epidemic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06179v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The opioid epidemic is a crisis that has plagued the United States (US) for decades. One central issue is inequitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), which puts certain populations at a higher risk of opioid overdose. We integrate a predictive dynamical model and a prescriptive optimization problem to compute high-quality opioid treatment facility and treatment budget allocations for each US state. Our predictive model is a differential equation-based epidemiological model that captures opioid epidemic dynamics. We use a process inspired by neural ODEs to fit this model to opioid epidemic data for each state and obtain estimates for unknown parameters in the model. We then incorporate this epidemiological model into a mixed-integer optimization problem (MIP) that aims to minimize opioid overdose deaths and the number of people with OUD. We develop strong relaxations based on McCormick envelopes to efficiently compute approximate solutions to our MIPs with a mean optimality gap of 3.99%. Our method provides socioeconomically equitable solutions, as it incentivizes investments in areas with higher social vulnerability (from the US Centers for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index) and opioid prescribing rates. On average, our approach decreases the number of people with OUD by 9.03 $\pm$ 1.772%, increases the number of people in treatment by 88.75 $\pm$ 26.223%, and decreases opioid-related deaths by 0.58 $\pm$ 0.111% after 2 years compared to baseline epidemiological model predictions. Our solutions show that policy-makers should target adding treatment facilities to counties that have fewer facilities than their population share and are more socially vulnerable. We demonstrate that our optimization approach should help inform these decisions, as it yields population health benefits in comparison to benchmarks based solely on population and social vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Patterson-Sullivan measures for transverse subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Patterson-Sullivan measures for a class of discrete subgroups of higher rank semisimple Lie groups, called transverse groups, whose limit set is well-defined and transverse in a partial flag variety. This class of groups includes both Anosov and relatively Anosov groups, as well as all discrete subgroups of rank one Lie groups. We prove an analogue of the Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy and then use this dichotomy to prove a variant of Burger's Manhattan curve theorem. We also use the Patterson-Sullivan measures to obtain conditions for when a subgroup has critical exponent strictly less than the original transverse group. These gap results are new even for Anosov groups.</description>

      <title>Accumulation points of normalized approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on classical aspects of the theory of Diophantine approximation, we consider the collection of all accumulation points of normalized integer vector translates of points $q\alpha$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and $q\in\mathbb{Z}$. In the first part of the paper we derive measure theoretic and Hausdorff dimension results about the set of $\alpha$ whose accumulation points are all of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In the second part we focus primarily on the case when the coordinates of $\alpha$ together with $1$ form a basis for an algebraic number field $K$. Here we show that, under the correct normalization, the set of accumulation points displays an ordered geometric structure which reflects algebraic properties of the underlying number field. For example, when $d=2$, this collection of accumulation points can be described as a countable union of dilates (by norms of elements of an order in $K$) of a single ellipse, or of a pair of hyperbolas, depending on whether or not $K$ has a non-trivial embedding into $\mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum states resembling classical periodic trajectories in mesoscopic elliptic billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum wave function with localization on classical periodic orbits in a mesoscopic elliptic billiard has been achieved by appropriately superposing nearly degenerate eigenstates expressed as products of Mathieu functions. We analyze and discuss the rotational and librational regimes of motion in the elliptic billiard. Simplified line equations corresponding to the classical trajectories can be extracted from the quantum state as an integral equation involving angular Mathieu functions. The phase factors appearing in the integrals are connected to the classical initial positions and velocity components. We analyze the probability current density, the phase maps, and the vortex distributions of the periodic orbit quantum states for both rotational and librational motions; furthermore, they may represent traveling and standing trajectories inside the elliptic billiard.</description>
