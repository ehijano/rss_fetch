      <title>FireRedTTS-1S: An Upgraded Streamable Foundation Text-to-Speech System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a high-quality streaming foundation text-to-speech system, FireRedTTS-1S, upgraded from the streamable version of FireRedTTS. FireRedTTS-1S achieves streaming generation via two steps: text-to-semantic decoding and semantic-to-acoustic decoding. In text-to-semantic decoding, a semantic-aware speech tokenizer converts the speech signal into semantic tokens, which can be synthesized from the text via a semantic language model in an auto-regressive manner. Meanwhile, the semantic-to-acoustic decoding module simultaneously translates generated semantic tokens into the speech signal in a streaming way via a super-resolution causal audio codec and a multi-stream acoustic language model. This design enables us to produce high-quality speech audio in zero-shot settings while presenting a real-time generation process with low latency under 150ms. In experiments on zero-shot voice cloning, the objective results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality foundation model with comparable intelligibility and speaker similarity over industrial baseline systems. Furthermore, the subjective score of FireRedTTS-1S highlights its impressive synthesis performance, achieving comparable quality to the ground-truth recordings. These results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality streaming foundation TTS system.</description>

      <title>Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model designed to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in a streaming manner. To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs, both audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. To synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio and video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position embedding approach, named TMRoPE(Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently generate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two modalities, we propose \textbf{Thinker-Talker} architecture. In this framework, Thinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while Talker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden representations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the Thinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an end-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we introduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to reduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with the similarly sized Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench. Notably, Qwen2.5-Omni's performance in end-to-end speech instruction following is comparable to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks such as MMLU and GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omni's streaming Talker outperforms most existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in robustness and naturalness.</description>

      <title>QualiSpeech: A Speech Quality Assessment Dataset with Natural Language Reasoning and Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel perspective to speech quality assessment by leveraging natural language descriptions, offering richer, more nuanced insights than traditional numerical scoring methods. Natural language feedback provides instructive recommendations and detailed evaluations, yet existing datasets lack the comprehensive annotations needed for this approach. To bridge this gap, we introduce QualiSpeech, a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset encompassing 11 key aspects and detailed natural language comments that include reasoning and contextual insights. Additionally, we propose the QualiSpeech Benchmark to evaluate the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that finetuned auditory LLMs can reliably generate detailed descriptions of noise and distortion, effectively identifying their types and temporal characteristics. The results further highlight the potential for incorporating reasoning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of quality assessments. The dataset will be released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/QualiSpeech.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology represents an innovative fiber-optic-based sensing methodology that enables real-time acoustic signal monitoring through the detection of minute perturbations along optical fibers. This sensing approach offers compelling advantages, including extensive measurement ranges, exceptional spatial resolution, and an expansive dynamic measurement spectrum.
  The integration of machine learning (ML) paradigms presents transformative potential for DAS technology, encompassing critical domains such as data augmentation, sophisticated preprocessing techniques, and advanced acoustic event classification and recognition. By leveraging ML algorithms, DAS systems can transition from traditional data processing methodologies to more automated and intelligent analytical frameworks.
  The computational intelligence afforded by ML-enhanced DAS technologies facilitates unprecedented monitoring capabilities across diverse critical infrastructure sectors. Particularly noteworthy are the technology's applications in transportation infrastructure, energy management systems, and Natural disaster monitoring frameworks, where the precision of data acquisition and the reliability of intelligent decision-making mechanisms are paramount.
  This research critically examines the comparative performance characteristics of classical machine learning methodologies and state-of-the-art deep learning models in the context of DAS data recognition and interpretation, offering comprehensive insights into the evolving landscape of intelligent sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Audio-Visual Editing via Cross-Modal Delta Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce zero-shot audio-video editing, a novel task that requires transforming original audio-visual content to align with a specified textual prompt without additional model training. To evaluate this task, we curate a benchmark dataset, AvED-Bench, designed explicitly for zero-shot audio-video editing. AvED-Bench includes 110 videos, each with a 10-second duration, spanning 11 categories from VGGSound. It offers diverse prompts and scenarios that require precise alignment between auditory and visual elements, enabling robust evaluation. We identify limitations in existing zero-shot audio and video editing methods, particularly in synchronization and coherence between modalities, which often result in inconsistent outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose AvED, a zero-shot cross-modal delta denoising framework that leverages audio-video interactions to achieve synchronized and coherent edits. AvED demonstrates superior results on both AvED-Bench and the recent OAVE dataset to validate its generalization capabilities. Results are available at https://genjib.github.io/project_page/AVED/index.html</description>

      <title>Quantification of Tenseness in English and Japanese Tense-Lax Vowels: A Lagrangian Model with Indicator {\theta}1 and Force of Tenseness Ftense(t)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of vowel tenseness has traditionally been examined through the binary distinction of tense and lax vowels. However, no universally accepted quantitative definition of tenseness has been established in any language. Previous studies, including those by Jakobson, Fant, and Halle (1951) and Chomsky and Halle (1968), have explored the relationship between vowel tenseness and the vocal tract. Building on these foundations, Ishizaki (2019, 2022) proposed an indirect quantification of vowel tenseness using formant angles {\theta}1 and {\theta}F1 and their first and second derivatives, dZ1(t)/dt = lim tan {\theta}1(t) and d2Z1(t)/dt2 = d/dt lim tan {\theta}1(t). This study extends this approach by investigating the potential role of a force-related parameter in determining vowel quality. Specifically, we introduce a simplified model based on the Lagrangian equation to describe the dynamic interaction of the tongue and jaw within the oral cavity during the articulation of close vowels. This model provides a theoretical framework for estimating the forces involved in vowel production across different languages, offering new insights into the physical mechanisms underlying vowel articulation. The findings suggest that this force-based perspective warrants further exploration as a key factor in phonetic and phonological studies.</description>
