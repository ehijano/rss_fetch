      <title>Learning Conjugate Direction Fields for Planar Quadrilateral Mesh Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar quadrilateral (PQ) mesh generation is a key process in computer-aided design, particularly for architectural applications where the goal is to discretize a freeform surface using planar quad faces. The conjugate direction field (CDF) defined on the freeform surface plays a significant role in generating a PQ mesh, as it largely determines the PQ mesh layout. Conventionally, a CDF is obtained by solving a complex non-linear optimization problem that incorporates user preferences, i.e., aligning the CDF with user-specified strokes on the surface. This often requires a large number of iterations that are computationally expensive, preventing the interactive CDF design process for a desirable PQ mesh. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven approach based on neural networks for controlled CDF generation. Our approach can effectively learn and fuse features from the freeform surface and the user strokes, and efficiently generate quality CDF respecting user guidance. To enable training and testing, we also present a dataset composed of 50000+ freeform surfaces with ground-truth CDFs, as well as a set of metrics for quantitative evaluation. The effectiveness and efficiency of our work are demonstrated by extensive experiments using testing data, architectural surfaces, and general 3D shapes.</description>

      <title>Locomotion in CAVE: Enhancing Immersion through Full-Body Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) is one of the virtual reality (VR) immersive devices currently used to present virtual environments. However, the locomotion methods in the CAVE are limited by unnatural interaction methods, severely hindering the user experience and immersion in the CAVE. We proposed a locomotion framework for CAVE environments aimed at enhancing the immersive locomotion experience through optimized human motion recognition technology. Firstly, we construct a four-sided display CAVE system, then through the dynamic method based on Perspective-n-Point to calibrate the camera, using the obtained camera intrinsics and extrinsic parameters, and an action recognition architecture to get the action category. At last, transform the action category to a graphical workstation that renders display effects on the screen. We designed a user study to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to the traditional methods, our method has significant improvements in realness and self-presence in the virtual environment, effectively reducing motion sickness.</description>

      <title>TR-Gaussians: High-fidelity Real-time Rendering of Planar Transmission and Reflection with 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Transmission-Reflection Gaussians (TR-Gaussians), a novel 3D-Gaussian-based representation for high-fidelity rendering of planar transmission and reflection, which are ubiquitous in indoor scenes. Our method combines 3D Gaussians with learnable reflection planes that explicitly model the glass planes with view-dependent reflectance strengths. Real scenes and transmission components are modeled by 3D Gaussians and the reflection components are modeled by the mirrored Gaussians with respect to the reflection plane. The transmission and reflection components are blended according to a Fresnel-based, view-dependent weighting scheme, allowing for faithful synthesis of complex appearance effects under varying viewpoints. To effectively optimize TR-Gaussians, we develop a multi-stage optimization framework incorporating color and geometry constraints and an opacity perturbation mechanism. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that TR-Gaussians achieve real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis in scenes with planar transmission and reflection, and outperform state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Force-Aware 3D Contact Modeling for Stable Grasp Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact-based grasp generation plays a crucial role in various applications. Recent methods typically focus on the geometric structure of objects, producing grasps with diverse hand poses and plausible contact points. However, these approaches often overlook the physical attributes of the grasp, specifically the contact force, leading to reduced stability of the grasp. In this paper, we focus on stable grasp generation using explicit contact force predictions. First, we define a force-aware contact representation by transforming the normal force value into discrete levels and encoding it using a one-hot vector. Next, we introduce force-aware stability constraints. We define the stability problem as an acceleration minimization task and explicitly relate stability with contact geometry by formulating the underlying physical constraints. Finally, we present a pose optimizer that systematically integrates our contact representation and stability constraints to enable stable grasp generation. We show that these constraints can help identify key contact points for stability which provide effective initialization and guidance for optimization towards a stable grasp. Experiments are carried out on two public benchmarks, showing that our method brings about 20% improvement in stability metrics and adapts well to novel objects.</description>

      <title>MedBuild AI: An Agent-Based Hybrid Intelligence Framework for Reshaping Agency in Healthcare Infrastructure Planning through Generative Design for Medical Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globally, disparities in healthcare infrastructure remain stark, leaving countless communities without access to even basic services. Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.</description>

      <title>On The Topology of Polygonal Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is an introductory and informal exposition on the topology of polygonal meshes. We begin with a broad overview of topological notions and discuss how homeomorphisms, homotopy, and homology can be used to characterize topology. We move on to define polygonal meshes and make a distinction between intrinsic topology and extrinsic topology which depends on the embedding space. A distinction is also made between quantitative topological properties and qualitative properties. We outline a proof of the Euler and the Euler-Poincar\'e formulas. The Betti numbers are defined in terms of the Euler-Poincar\'e formula and other mesh statistics rather than as cardinalities of the homology groups which allows us to avoid abstract algebra. Finally, we discuss how it is possible to cut a polygonal mesh such that it becomes a topological disc.</description>

      <title>A neural optimization framework for free-boundary diffeomorphic mapping problems and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-boundary diffeomorphism optimization is a core ingredient in the surface mapping problem but remains notoriously difficult because the boundary is unconstrained and local bijectivity must be preserved under large deformation. Numerical Least-Squares Quasiconformal (LSQC) theory, with its provable existence, uniqueness, similarity-invariance and resolution-independence, offers an elegant mathematical remedy. However, the conventional numerical algorithm requires landmark conditioning, and cannot be applied into gradient-based optimization. We propose a neural surrogate, the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), that embeds LSQC energy into a multiscale mesh-spectral architecture. Next, we propose the SBN guided optimization framework SBN-Opt which optimizes free-boundary diffeomorphism for the problem, with local geometric distortion explicitly controllable. Extensive experiments on density-equalizing maps and inconsistent surface registration demonstrate our SBN-Opt's superiority over traditional numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Co-Layout: LLM-driven Co-optimization for Interior Layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for automated interior design that combines large language models (LLMs) with grid-based integer programming to jointly optimize room layout and furniture placement. Given a textual prompt, the LLM-driven agent workflow extracts structured design constraints related to room configurations and furniture arrangements. These constraints are encoded into a unified grid-based representation inspired by ``Modulor". Our formulation accounts for key design requirements, including corridor connectivity, room accessibility, spatial exclusivity, and user-specified preferences. To improve computational efficiency, we adopt a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy that begins with a low-resolution grid to solve a simplified problem and guides the solution at the full resolution. Experimental results across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our joint optimization approach significantly outperforms existing two-stage design pipelines in solution quality, and achieves notable computational efficiency through the coarse-to-fine strategy.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Frequency-Decomposition Graph Neural Networks for Road Network Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road networks are critical infrastructures underpinning intelligent transportation systems and their related applications. Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Optimal-Transport Harmonization on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color harmonization adjusts the colors of an inserted object so that it perceptually matches the surrounding image, resulting in a seamless composite. The harmonization problem naturally arises in augmented reality (AR), yet harmonization algorithms are not currently integrated into AR pipelines because real-time solutions are scarce. In this work, we address color harmonization for AR by proposing a lightweight approach that supports on-device inference. For this, we leverage classical optimal transport theory by training a compact encoder to predict the Monge-Kantorovich transport map. We benchmark our MKL-Harmonizer algorithm against state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that for real composite AR images our method achieves the best aggregated score. We release our dedicated AR dataset of composite images with pixel-accurate masks and data-gathering toolkit to support further data acquisition by researchers.</description>

      <title>PFAvatar: Pose-Fusion 3D Personalized Avatar Reconstruction from Real-World Outfit-of-the-Day Photos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose PFAvatar (Pose-Fusion Avatar), a new method that reconstructs high-quality 3D avatars from ``Outfit of the Day'' (OOTD) photos, which exhibit diverse poses, occlusions, and complex backgrounds. Our method consists of two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pose-aware diffusion model from few-shot OOTD examples and (2) distilling a 3D avatar represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). In the first stage, unlike previous methods that segment images into assets (e.g., garments, accessories) for 3D assembly, which is prone to inconsistency, we avoid decomposition and directly model the full-body appearance. By integrating a pre-trained ControlNet for pose estimation and a novel Condition Prior Preservation Loss (CPPL), our method enables end-to-end learning of fine details while mitigating language drift in few-shot training. Our method completes personalization in just 5 minutes, achieving a 48$\times$ speed-up compared to previous approaches. In the second stage, we introduce a NeRF-based avatar representation optimized by canonical SMPL-X space sampling and Multi-Resolution 3D-SDS. Compared to mesh-based representations that suffer from resolution-dependent discretization and erroneous occluded geometry, our continuous radiance field can preserve high-frequency textures (e.g., hair) and handle occlusions correctly through transmittance. Experiments demonstrate that PFAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, detail preservation, and robustness to occlusions/truncations, advancing practical 3D avatar generation from real-world OOTD albums. In addition, the reconstructed 3D avatar supports downstream applications such as virtual try-on, animation, and human video reenactment, further demonstrating the versatility and practical value of our approach.</description>

      <title>SymGS : Leveraging Local Symmetries for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a transformative technique in novel view synthesis, primarily due to its high rendering speed and photorealistic fidelity. However, its memory footprint scales rapidly with scene complexity, often reaching several gigabytes. Existing methods address this issue by introducing compression strategies that exploit primitive-level redundancy through similarity detection and quantization. We aim to surpass the compression limits of such methods by incorporating symmetry-aware techniques, specifically targeting mirror symmetries to eliminate redundant primitives. We propose a novel compression framework, \textbf{\textit{SymGS}}, introducing learnable mirrors into the scene, thereby eliminating local and global reflective redundancies for compression. Our framework functions as a plug-and-play enhancement to state-of-the-art compression methods, (e.g. HAC) to achieve further compression. Compared to HAC, we achieve $1.66 \times$ compression across benchmark datasets (upto $3\times$ on large-scale scenes). On an average, SymGS enables $\bf{108\times}$ compression of a 3DGS scene, while preserving rendering quality.

      <description>arXiv:2412.08484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern geometric generation methods rely heavily on deep learning methods that, while powerful, often lack interpretability and require extensive training data. This work introduces MeshCone, a convex optimization framework for mesh enhancement from partially deformed meshes that requires no training data. We formulate the problem as a second-order cone program where vertex positions are optimized to align with target geometry while enforcing smoothness through convex edge-length regularization. Our convex relaxation enables deterministic, interpretable solutions with proven convergence properties via the Splitting Conic Solver (SCS). We demonstrate robust performance across 56 diverse object categories from ShapeNet and ThreeDScans, achieving superior refinement quality compared to classical baselines while maintaining sub-second inference times. This work establishes a principled baseline demonstrating what convex optimization alone can achieve, providing mathematical guarantees and interpretability that complement data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>StrokeFusion: Vector Sketch Generation via Joint Stroke-UDF Encoding and Latent Sequence Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of sketch generation, raster-format trained models often produce non-stroke artifacts, while vector-format trained models typically lack a holistic understanding of sketches, leading to compromised recognizability. Moreover, existing methods struggle to extract common features from similar elements (e.g., eyes of animals) appearing at varying positions across sketches. To address these challenges, we propose StrokeFusion, a two-stage framework for vector sketch generation. It contains a dual-modal sketch feature learning network that maps strokes into a high-quality latent space. This network decomposes sketches into normalized strokes and jointly encodes stroke sequences with Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) maps, representing sketches as sets of stroke feature vectors. Building upon this representation, our framework exploits a stroke-level latent diffusion model that simultaneously adjusts stroke position, scale, and trajectory during generation. This enables high-fidelity sketch generation while supporting stroke interpolation editing. Extensive experiments on the QuickDraw dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, validating its effectiveness in preserving structural integrity and semantic features. Code and models will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos.</description>

      <title>Dream, Lift, Animate: From Single Images to Animatable Gaussian Avatars</title>

Abstract: We introduce Dream, Lift, Animate (DLA), a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D human avatars from a single image. This is achieved by leveraging multi-view generation, 3D Gaussian lifting, and pose-aware UV-space mapping of 3D Gaussians. Given an image, we first dream plausible multi-views using a video diffusion model, capturing rich geometric and appearance details. These views are then lifted into unstructured 3D Gaussians. To enable animation, we propose a transformer-based encoder that models global spatial relationships and projects these Gaussians into a structured latent representation aligned with the UV space of a parametric body model. This latent code is decoded into UV-space Gaussians that can be animated via body-driven deformation and rendered conditioned on pose and viewpoint. By anchoring Gaussians to the UV manifold, our method ensures consistency during animation while preserving fine visual details. DLA enables real-time rendering and intuitive editing without requiring post-processing. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the ActorsHQ and 4D-Dress datasets in both perceptual quality and photometric accuracy. By combining the generative strengths of video diffusion models with a pose-aware UV-space Gaussian mapping, DLA bridges the gap between unstructured 3D representations and high-fidelity, animation-ready avatars.</description>

      <title>READ: Real-time and Efficient Asynchronous Diffusion for Audio-driven Talking Head Generation</title>

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, a real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference processes of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.</description>

      <title>DogFit: Domain-guided Fine-tuning for Efficient Transfer Learning of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05685v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is challenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor generalization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering controllable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample diversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically requiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided Fine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion transfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional computational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the training loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the fine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation that during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger marginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable fidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength value as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning mechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the guidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies, i.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training stability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target domains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer learning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling TFLOPS.
