      <title>Recent Developments of the VOXES Von Hamos X-ray Spectrometer for Laboratory XES and XAS Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VOXES is a Von Hamos X-ray spectrometer developed at the INFN National Laboratories of Frascati for high-resolution laboratory X-ray spectroscopy in the 5--20~keV range. It uses curved mosaic crystals and motorized positioning stages to perform wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) with sub-10~eV tunable resolution for extended and dilute samples. Recent developments include the integration of an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) line based on a silicon pin-diode detector, which enables flux monitoring and simultaneous ED and WD measurements. In addition, a dedicated liquid-sample holder has been introduced, and a Y-shaped support geometry, crucial for switching to a transmission layout, provides mechanical compatibility with laboratory XAS, now under implementation. These upgrades expand the versatility and automation of VOXES, strengthening its role as a table-top platform for laboratory X-ray spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A CMOS+X Spiking Neuron With On-Chip Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03966v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and numerical simulation of a spiking neuron capable of on-chip machine learning. Built within the CMOS+X framework, the spiking neuron consists of an NMOS transistor combined with a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). This NMOS+MTJ unit, when simulated in the industry-standard circuit simulation software LTspice, reproduces multiple functions of a biological neuron, including threshold spiking, latency, refractory periods, synaptic integration, inhibition, and adaptation. These behaviors arise from the intrinsic magnetization dynamics of the MTJ and do not require any additional control circuitry. By interconnecting the NMOS+MTJ neurons, we construct a model of an analog multilayer network that learns through spike-timing-dependent weight updates derived from a gradient-descent rule, with both training and inference modeled in the analog domain. The simulated CMOS+X network achieves reliable spike propagation and successful training on a nonlinear task, indicating a feasible path toward compact, low-power, in-memory neuromorphic hardware for edge applications.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of KV-Class \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Trench Junction Barrier Schottky Diodes with SpaceModulated Junction Termination Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report on the design and fabrication of p-NiO/Ga2O3 trench junction barrier schottky diodes (JBSD) integrated with space-modulated junction termination extension (SM-JTE) and compare the performance with planar Ni/Ga2O3 schottky diodes (SBDs) and p-NiO/Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs). The JBSDs achieved breakdown voltages exceeding 1.8 kV along with low leakage currents (&lt;10-2 A/cm2), while displaying low turn on voltage (VON) of ~1V, which is similar to that of planar Ni/Ga2O3 SBDs. The fabricated devices showed excellent forward characteristics with low differential on-resistance (Ron,sp) ranging from 4-10.5 m{\Omega}-cm2, for fin width between 0.6- 1.25 microns. Best performing device with fin width of 0.85{\mu}m showed a unipolar figure of merit (FOM) of ~0.7GW/cm2. This work showcases the benefits of trench JBS design along with SM-JTE edge-termination for efficient high-performance kilovolt-class \b{eta}- Ga2O3 diodes.</description>

      <title>ASPEN: An Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network for Ginzburg-Landau Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in an amorphous antiferromagnet with inverted hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stemming from antiferromagnetic coupling, exchange bias allows inverted hysteresis in a magnetic system. Such room temperature magnetic reversal has yet to be observed in an amorphous antiferromagnet. Furthermore, the impact of this exchange bias effect on its magnetoelectric transport behavior remains a mystery. Here we discovered a zero-field magnetization switching effect in an exchange-biased amorphous antiferromagnet with inverted magnetic hysteresis. This zero-field magnetic reversal was further evidenced by its inverted large anomalous Hall effect. Notably, this collective spin flipping at zero field can occur at room temperature or above room temperature, which may be associated with quantum interference effect due to thermal fluctuation enhanced disorder. Our experimental results offer a way to design room-temperature exchange-biased amorphous antiferromagnets with zero-field multi magnetic-states and large anomalous Hall effect, holding potential for low-power and high-density memory applications.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Modulated Electron Lattice and d-Wave Superconductivity in Cuprates: A Phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for high-$T_c$ cuprates in which a short-range modulation of the electronic charge density couples to a $d$-wave superconducting condensate. The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $\Delta(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions.</description>

      <title>On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of differential phase contrast (DPC) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has shown much promise for directly investigating the functional properties of a material system, leveraging the natural coupling between the electron probe and atomic-scale electric fields to map the electrostatic configuration within a sample. However, the high sensitivity of these measurements makes them particularly vulnerable to variations in both sample properties and the configuration of the instrument, stressing the need for robust methodologies to ensure more accurate analyses. In this work, the influence of key instrumental parameters - probe convergence angle, defocus and two-fold astigmatism - on atomic-resolution segmented-detector DPC-STEM measurements is evaluated through extensive image simulations. Results show that the limit of interpretability for a 21 mrad defocused probe is found at a magnitude of 4 nm, where electrostatic field magnitude can be underestimated by about 16 % in overfocus and just above 10 % in underfocus. Equivalent results for a 30 mrad probe demonstrate underestimated values around 30 % at overfocus and 20 % for underfocus, at a lower interpretability limit of 3 nm. Two-fold astigmatism introduces orientation dependent variations that surpass 40 % for magnitudes below 3 nm, but a reduction in sensitivity to the aberration is observed when oriented along detector-segment edges. Overall, the analysis confirms the sensitivity and usefulness of the scattergram-based method and underscores the importance of optimized instrumental alignment for accurate CoM based STEM imaging.</description>

      <title>Spin-flop driven interfacial tunneling magnetoresistance in an antiferromagnetic tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utilization of two-dimensional (2D) materials in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) has shown excellent performance and rich physics. As for 2D antiferromagnets, the magnetic moments in different layers respond asynchronously and can be configured at various states under different magnetic fields, showing the possibility of efficient magnetic and electrical tunability. In this report, A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) material (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 (FCGT) works as electrodes to realize full van der Waals magnetic tunnel junctions. Owing to the interfacial effect, the even-layer FCGT, although with zero net magnetization, exhibits spin selectivity in MTJ architecture contributing to a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) reaching about 25% at a low operating current 1 nA at 100 K and persists near room temperature. Due to the surface spin-flop (SSF) effect in antiferromagnetic FCGT, the alternation flexibility between the volatile and nonvolatile memory behavior is achieved. The interfacial TMR can be tuned efficiently in amplitude and even sign under different bias currents and temperatures. These findings show precise magnetoelectric manipulation in MTJs based on 2D antiferromagnets and highlight the promise of 2D antiferromagnets for spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Passive Silicon Nitride On-Chip Polarimetry: Precise Polarization Detection with Imperfect Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization is a fundamental property of light that carries distinct and valuable information. Consequently, its precise measurement is crucial for numerous applications, including biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication. Since polarization cannot be measured directly, it is typically inferred by converting it into intensity signals using dedicated optical elements. Conventional approaches, however, predominantly rely on bulky optical components, leading to considerably high fabrication costs and limited integration density. Here, we introduce a passive photonic integrated circuit capable of precisely determining the polarization state of visible free-space light. An silicon nitride on-chip architecture employing a compact polarization-splitting grating coupler and a set of passive interferometers encodes the polarization information into intensity signals, allowing conventional detectors to accurately reconstruct the polarization state. With increasing compactness of photonic components, however, susceptibility to fabrication tolerances as well as intrinsic design constraints increases, potentially leading to non\-/ideal behaviour. To address this, we introduce a robust calibration procedure that enables precise measurements even in the presence of imperfections. The chip design, combined with the calibration procedure, offers a robust, small-footprint, and high-speed approach to polarimetry, enabling a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Applied Neural Network-Based Active Control for Vortex-Induced Vibrations Suppression in a Two-Degree-of-Freedom Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIVs) of cylindrical structures present significant challenges in various engineering applications, including marine risers, tall buildings, and renewable energy systems. Hence, it is vital to control Vortex-Induced Vibrations of cylindrical structures. For this purpose, in this study a novel approach is introduced to VIV control, based on a model-based active control strategy integrated with a Neural Network (NN) in the presence of uncertainty modeling. The proposed method utilizes a closed-loop control system, where feedback from the system's dynamic state is used to generate adaptive control commands, enabling the system to respond to changing flow conditions and nonlinearities. Then, the controllability analysis is conducted to assess the efficiency of the control strategy in mitigating VIV. Two control approaches are implemented: simple learning and composite learning. Both strategies significantly enhance vibration suppression, achieving up to 99% reduction in vibrations despite uncertainties in the system. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance the efficiency, stability, and lifespan of structures subject to VIV.</description>

      <title>On the surface Bloch waves in truncated periodic media: scalar-wave primer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much like their counterparts in homogenous elastic solids, waves in periodic media can be broadly classified into Floquet-Bloch body waves, and evanescent surface waves. Our goal is to elucidate the latter boundary layers, termed surface Bloch (SB) waves, affiliated with rational surface cuts and homogeneous Neumann data. To this end we adopt a two-dimensional (2D) scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients (describing anticline shear waves in phonoic crystals) as a test bed and develop a unit cell-of-periodicity-based, reduced order model of the SB waves that is capable of describing both their dispersion, waveforms, and ``skin depth''. The centerpiece of our analysis is a quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP) for the effective unit cell of periodicity -- deriving from a geometric interplay between the mother Bravais lattice and orientation of the surface cut -- that seeks the complex wavenumber normal to the cut plane given (i) the excitation frequency and (ii) wavenumber in the direction of the cut plane. In this way the sought boundary layer is derived via superposition of the evanescent QEP eigenstates, whose relative amplitudes are obtained by imposing the homogeneous boundary condition. With the QEP eigenspectrum at hand, evaluation of an SB wave -- in terms of both dispersion characteristics and evanescent waveforms -- entails only a low-dimensional eigenvalue problem. This feature caters for rapid exploration of the effect of (periodic) surface undulations, and so enables manipulation of the SB waves via optimal design of the surface cut. Our analysis also includes an account for the power flow and ``skin depth'' of a surface Bloch wave, both of which are critical for the energetic relevance of boundary layers.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity NV Ensemble Imaging via AOD-Based Raster Scanning and Photodetection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.</description>

      <title>Photovoltaic potential of tin perovskites revealed through layer-by-layer investigation of optoelectronic and charge transport properties</title>

Abstract: Tin perovskites are the most promising environmentally friendly alternative to lead perovskites. Among tin perovskites, FASnI3 (CH4N2SnI3) shows optimum band gap, and easy processability. However, the performance of FASnI3 based solar cells is incomparable to lead perovskites for several reasons, including energy band mismatch between the perovskite absorber film and the charge transporting layers (CTLs) for both types of carriers, i.e., for electrons (ETLs) and holes (HTLs). However, the band diagrams in the literature are inconsistent, and the charge extraction dynamics are poorly understood. In this paper, we study the energy band positions of FASnI3 based perovskites using Kelvin probe (KP) and photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) to provide a precise band diagram of the most used device stack. In addition, we analyze the defects within the current energetic landscape of tin perovskites. We uncover the role of bathocuproine (BCP) in enhancing the electron extraction at the fullerene C60/BCP interface. Furthermore, we used transient surface photovoltage (tr-SPV) for the first time for tin perovskites to understand the charge extraction dynamics of the most reported HTLs such as NiOx and PEDOT, and ETLs such as C60, ICBA, and PCBM. Finally, we used Hall effect, KP, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to estimate an accurate value of the p-doping concentration in FASnI3 and showed a consistent result of 1.5 * 1017 cm-3. Our findings prove that the energetic system of tin halide perovskites is deformed and should be redesigned independently from lead perovskites to unlock the full potential of tin perovskites.</description>

      <title>Observation of Fine Structure in Channeling of Particles in Bent Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observed highly efficient manipulation of the 530 MeV positron beam at Mainz Microtron via bent crystals. The low beam divergence revealed a fine structure in the angular distribution of channeled particles. A compact analytical model, supported by Monte Carlo including multiple scattering, accounts for the measurements. We established a criterion for designing a crystal with reduced angular spread of channeled particles for beam manipulation at any energy. This finding is particularly useful in view of applications of channeling to the highest energies.</description>

      <title>Hybrid confinement techniques for polariton simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polariton III-V semiconductor microcavities provide a robust platform for emulating complex Hamiltonians, enabling topological photonics and quantum simulation for advanced photonic functionalities. Here, we introduce two novel fabrication techniques - etch-and-oversputter and deposit-and-oversputter - that overcome limitations of traditional photonic confinement. Both use structured, locally elongated semiconductor cavities to create deep, highly controllable potentials, while leveraging high-quality GaAs-based materials, which achieve excellent Q-factors. A sputtered all-dielectric top mirror introduces an innovative hybrid approach, simplifying fabrication while maintaining quality compared to deep ion etching. Utilizing a Kagome lattice as a benchmark, we show high-quality optical band structures previously inaccessible with deep etching. Furthermore, we study a two-dimensional breathing Kagome lattice and demonstrate polariton lasing from a zero-dimensional corner mode, confirming precise control over couplings and tight polariton localization. These methods enable fabrication of intricate lattices, including higher-order topological insulators, or on-chip quantum regimes utilizing the polariton blockade mechanism due to tight photonic confinement.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced directional transport in extended SSH chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker framework.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Centrifuge Effects in Ultrafast Laser Ablation Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with effective rotation rates on the order of $10^9$ radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field $B_{eff}$ is extracted for Ni isotopes which is shown to be a combination of an axial $B_z$ component and a second contribution $B_{ibw}$ that represents the equivalent of an effective magnetic field contributing to the isotopic separation due to broad spectrum Ion Bernstein Waves providing electrostatic acceleration to the cyclotron orbits. These IBWs are also responsible for a profound resonance of enrichment observed for certain specific charge states. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotation and IBWs dominate the process.</description>
