      <title>On the Macdonald correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1980 Ian G. Macdonald established an explicit bijection between the isomorphism classes of the irreducible representations of ${\mathrm{GL}}_n(k)$, where $k$ is a finite field, and inertia equivalence classes of admissible tamely ramified $n$-dimensional Weil-Deligne representations of $W_F$, where $F$ is a non-archimedean local field with residue field $k$ and $W_F$ the absolute Weil group of $F$.
  We describe a construction of the Macdonald correspondence based on the specialization to ${\mathrm{GL}}_n(k)$ of Lusztig's classification of irreducible representations of finite groups of Lie type, and review some properties of the correspondence. We define $\epsilon$-factors for pairs of irreducible cuspidal representations of finite general linear groups, and show that they match with the expected Deligne $\epsilon$-factors under the Macdonald correspondence. We use these $\epsilon$-factors for pairs to obtain a characterization of the Macdonald correspondence for the irreducible cuspidal representations</description>

      <title>Comparing $\tau$-tilting modules and $1$-tilting modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize $\tau$-tilting modules as $1$-tilting modules over quotient algebras satisfying a tensor-vanishing condition, and characterize $1$-tilting modules as $\tau$-tilting modules satisfying a ${\rm Tor}^1$-vanishing condition. We use delooping levels to study \emph{Self-orthogonal $\tau$-tilting Conjecture}: any self-orthogonal $\tau$-tilting module is $1$-tilting. We confirm the conjecture when the endomorphism algebra of the module has finite global delooping level.</description>

      <title>Equivariant vertex coalgebras, $C_2$-coalgebras and duality for diagonalisable group schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define vertex algebras and vertex coalgebras in the category of rational $G_\Gamma$-modules, where $G_\Gamma$ is the group scheme defined by the group algebra $\mathsf k \Gamma$ for an abelian group $\Gamma$. In this context, we introduce the notion of $C_2$-coalgebra for a vertex coalgebra. We prove that there exists a duality between vertex algebras and vertex coalgebras in the category of $G_\Gamma$-modules, and this duality establishes a connection between $C_2$-algebras and $C_2$-coalgebras. Moreover, we also investigate the relationship between their respective modules/comodules.</description>

Abstract: Let $(\pi,V)$ be a smooth representation of a compact Lie group $G$ on a quasi-complete locally convex complex topological vector space. We show that the Lie algebra cohomology space $\mathrm{H} ^\bullet(\mathfrak{u}, V)$ and the Lie algebra homology space $\mathrm{H}_\bullet(\mathfrak{u}, V)$ are both Hausdorff, where $\mathfrak{u}$ is the nilpotent radical of a parabolic subalgebra of the complexified Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$.</description>

      <title>Non-abelianess of the category of modules over a sum-id bipresheaf of rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small category, motivated by the definition of bisheaves of abelian groups of MacPherson and Patel (see the Definition 5.1 of the paper: R. MacPherson and A. Patel. Persistent local systems. Adv. in Math. 386: 107795, 2021), we first introduce the notions of bipresheaves of rings $\mathfrak{R}$ on $\mathcal{C}$ and their module categories $\mbox{Mod-} \mathfrak{R}$. Then the linear Grothendieck construction $Gr(\mathfrak{R})$ of $\mathfrak{R}$ is defined. With this linear Grothendieck construction, we show that the category of bipresheaves of modules over a sum-id bipresheaf of rings $\mathfrak{R}$ can be characterized as the category of bipresheaves of abelian groups on $Gr(\mathfrak{R})$. It follows that the category $\mbox{Mod-} \mathfrak{R}$ of modules over a sum-id bipresheaf of rings $\mathfrak{R}$ is non-abelian.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau techniques for Namikawa-Weyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of symplectic singularities aims to build a 21st century Lie theory. A key development is the Namikawa-Weyl group, which generalizes the classical Weyl group of Lie algebras. Another cornerstone is the integration of categorical Calabi-Yau techniques, capturing the rich algebraic structure of these singularities. In this paper, we develop a systematic strategy to determine Namikawa-Weyl groups for representation spaces of Calabi-Yau-2 algebras, leveraging local-to-global functors, symmetry analysis, and $ A_{\infty} $-methods. Applying this approach to quiver varieties, we carry out the detailed calculations and recover Yaochen Wu's result.</description>

      <title>Cyclic quantum Teichm\"uller theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the pioneering ideas of Kashaev [Kas98,Kas00], we present a fully explicit construction of a finite-dimensional projective representation of the dotted Ptolemy groupoid when the quantum parameter $q$ is a root of unity, which reproduces the central charge of the $SU(2)$ Wess--Zumino--Witten model. A basic ingredient is the cyclic quantum dilogarithm [FK94].
  A notable contribution of this work is a reinterpretation of the relations among the parameters in the cyclic quantum dilogarithm to ensure its pentagon identity in terms of the \emph{mutations of coefficients}. In particular, we elucidate the dual roles of these parameters: as coefficients in quantum cluster algebras and as the central characters of quantum cluster variables.
  We introduce the quantum intertwiner associated with a mapping class as a composite of cyclic quantum dilogarithm operators, whose trace defines a quantum invariant. We provide a canonical method to reduce the entire theory to an irreducible representation of the Chekhov--Fock algebra. The reduced intertwiner corresponds to the one studied by Bonahon--Liu [BL07] and Bonahon--Wong--Yang [BWY21,BWY22], which is now expressed using the cyclic quantum dilogarithm operators.
  Finally, we describe the connection to the Kashaev's $6j$-symbol [Kas94,Kas95] within our framework, which elucidates the fundamental relationship between our quantum invariant and the Kashaev's link invariant.</description>

      <title>An abelian formula for the quantum Weyl group action of the coroot lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let g be a complex simple Lie algebra and Uq(Lg) its quantum loop algebra, where q is not a root of unity. We give an explicit formula for the quantum Weyl group action of the coroot lattice Q of g on finite-dimensional representations of Uq(Lg) in terms of its commuting generators. The answer is expressed in terms of the Chari-Pressley series, whose evaluation on highest weight vectors gives rise to Drinfeld polynomials. It hinges on a strong rationality result for that series, which is derived in the present paper. As an application, we identify the action of Q on the equivariant K-theory of Nakajima quiver varieties with that of explicitly given determinant line bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem to higher algebra by establishing a version that applies to spectral Lie algebras. We deduce this statement from a basic relation between operads in spectra: the commutative operad is the quotient of the associative operad by a right action of the spectral Lie operad. This statement, in turn, is a consequence of a fundamental relation between different $\mathbb{E}_n$-operads, which we articulate and prove. We deduce a variant of the Poincar\'{e}--Birkhoff--Witt theorem for relative enveloping algebras of $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras. Our methods also give a simple construction and description of the higher enveloping $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras of a spectral Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Resolution of singularities via Tannaka duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving finite quotient singularities is a classical problem in algebraic geometry. Traditional methods of Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) translate the singularity into a quiver representation space and take the GIT quotient with respect to a generic stability parameter. While this approach easily produces smooth resolutions, it fails to produce any stacky resolutions, as quiver representation spaces lack finite stabilizers.
  This paper provides an alternative framework which produces both smooth and stacky resolutions. Our framework is based on a trick of Abdelgadir and Segal, which deploys Tannaka duality to describe the points of the classifying stack of a finite group in terms of algebraic data. Abdelgadir and Segal successfully pursue this strategy and obtain smooth and stacky resolutions in the Kleinian $ D_4 $ case. We generalize this strategy to all Kleinian singularities and obtain a series of varieties which we refer to as Clebsch-Gordan varieties. We provide tools to work with these Clebsch-Gordan varieties, analyze their stable loci with respect to different stability parameters, and study the Kleinian $ A_n $ and $ D_n $ cases in detail.</description>

      <title>Matrix recursion for positive characteristic diagrammatic Soergel bimodules for affine Weyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.07072v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $W$ be an affine Weyl group, and let $\Bbbk$ be a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. The diagrammatic Hecke category $\mathcal{D}$ for $W$ over $\Bbbk$ is a categorification of the Hecke algebra for $W$ with rich connections to modular representation theory. We explicitly construct a functor from $\mathcal{D}$ to a matrix category which categorifies a recursive representation $\xi: \mathbb{Z}W \rightarrow M_{p^r}(\mathbb{Z}W)$, where $r$ is the rank of the underlying finite root system. This functor gives a method for understanding diagrammatic Soergel bimodules in terms of other diagrammatic Soergel bimodules which are ``smaller'' by a factor of $p$. It also explains the presence of self-similarity in the $p$-canonical basis, which has been observed in small examples. By decategorifying we obtain a new lower bound on the $p$-canonical basis, which corresponds to new lower bounds on the characters of the indecomposable tilting modules by the recent $p$-canonical tilting character formula due to Achar-Makisumi-Riche-Williamson.</description>

      <title>The local converse theorem for odd special orthogonal and symplectic groups in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09004v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic different from $2$ and $G$ be either an odd special orthogonal group ${\rm SO}_{2r+1}(F)$ or a symplectic group ${\rm Sp}_{2r}(F)$. In this paper, we establish the local converse theorem for $G$. Namely, for given two irreducible admissible generic representations of $G$ with the same central character, if they have the same local gamma factors twisted by irreducible supercuspidal representations of ${\rm GL}_n(F)$ for all $1 \leq n \leq r$ with the same additive character, these representations are isomorphic. Using the theory of Cogdell, Shahidi, and Tsai on partial Bessel functions and the classification of irreducible generic representations, we break the barrier on the rank of twists $1 \leq n \leq 2r-1$ in the work of Jiang and Soudry, and extend the result of Q. Zhang, which was achieved for all supercuspidal representations in characteristic $0$.</description>

      <title>F-invariant in cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the $F$-invariant in cluster algebras using tropicalization. This is an analog of the $E$-invariant introduced by Derksen, Weyman and Zelevinsky in the additive categorification of cluster algebras and the $\mathfrak{d}$-invariant introduced by Kang, Kashiwara, Kim and Oh in the monoidal categorification of (quantum) cluster algebras. We prove that the product of two cluster monomials is still a cluster monomial if and only if their $F$-invariant is zero. For cluster algebras with a compatible Poisson bracket, we prove that if two cluster variables are log-cannonical, then they are contained in the same cluster.
  Inspired by $F$-invariant, we introduce the dominant sets for seeds of cluster algebras as an replacement of torsion classes for $\tau$-tilting pairs in $\tau$-tilting theory. With the help of the dominant sets, we prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras are acyclic. In particular, this implies that green mutations induce a partial order on the set of seeds (up to seed equivalence) of cluster algebras. We show that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras coincide with the Hasse quivers of the above posets of seeds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, Kashiwara-Kim-Oh-Park constructed cluster algebra structures on the Grothendieck rings of certain monoidal subcategories of the category of finite-dimensional representations of a quantum loop algebra, generalizing Hernandez-Leclerc's pioneering work from 2010. They stated the problem of finding explicit quivers for the seeds they used. We provide a solution by using Palu's generalized mutation rule applied to the cluster categories associated with certain algebras of global dimension at most 2, for example tensor products of path algebras of representation-finite quivers. Thus, our method is based on (and contributes to) the bridge, provided by cluster combinatorics, between the representation theory of quantum groups and that of quivers with relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of the representation ring of the symmetric group in dimension six. The Kronecker coefficients and all power formulas of irreducible representations of $S_6$ are computed using the character theory of finite groups. In addition, by direct sum decomposition of tensor products of different irreducible representations of $S_6$, we characterise generators of the representation ring $\mathcal{R}(S_6)$, show that its unit group $U(\mathcal{R}(S_6))$ is a Klein four-group and related results on the structure of primitive idempotents. Furthermore, we introduce Harrison center theory to study the representation ring and show that the Harrison center of the cubic form induced by the generating relations of $\mathcal{R}(S_6)$ is isomorphic to itself. Finally, we conclude with some open problems for future consideration.</description>

      <title>On the action of the symmetric group on the free LAnKe II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A LAnKe (also known as a Lie algebra of the $n$th kind, or a Filippov algebra) is a vector space equipped with a skew-symmetric $n$-linear form that satisfies the generalized Jacobi identity. The symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_m$ acts on the multilinear part of the free LAnKe on $m=(n-1)k+1$ generators, where $k$ is the number of brackets. The corresponding representation was studied by Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs, who asked whether for $n \ge k$, its irreducible decomposition contains no summand whose Young diagram has at most $k-1$ columns. It is known that the answer is affirmative if $k \le 3$. In this paper, we show that the answer is affirmative for all $k$.</description>

      <title>Homological properties of extensions of algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.12923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of extensions of associative algebras, which we refer to as ``strongly proj-bounded extensions''. We prove that the finiteness of the left global dimension and the support of the Hochschild homology is preserved by strongly proj-bounded extensions, generalizing results of Cibils, Lanzillota, Marcos and Solotar. Moreover, we show that the finiteness of the big left finitistic dimension is preserved by strongly proj-bounded extensions. In order to construct examples, we describe a new class of extensions of algebras of finite relative global dimension, which may be of independent interest. The results apply both for abstract (meaning no topology) and pseudocompact algebras.</description>

      <title>Exact structures for persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss applications of exact structures and relative homological algebra to the study of invariants of multiparameter persistence modules. This paper is mostly expository, but does contain a pair of novel results. Over finite posets, classical arguments about the relative projective modules of an exact structure make use of Auslander-Reiten theory. One of our results establishes a new adjunction which allows us to ``lift'' these arguments to certain infinite posets over which Auslander-Reiten sequences do not always exist. We give several examples of this lifting, in particular highlighting the non-existence and existence of resolutions by upsets when working with finitely presentable representations of the plane and of the closure of the positive quadrant, respectively. We then restrict our attention to finite posets. In this setting, we discuss the relationship between the global dimension of an exact structure and the representation dimension of the incidence algebra of the poset. We conclude with our second novel contribution. This is an explicit description of the irreducible morphisms between relative projective modules for several exact structures which have appeared previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the kernel of $\mathrm{SO}(3)$-Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev quantum representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the kernels of the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$-Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev quantum representations $\rho_p$ of mapping class groups of closed orientable surfaces $\Sigma_g$ of genus $g.$ We investigate the question whether the kernel of $\rho_p$ for $p$ prime is exactly the subgroup generated by $p$-th powers of Dehn twists. We show that if $g\geq 3$ and $p\geq 5$ then $\mathrm{Ker} \, \rho_p$ is contained in the subgroup generated by $p$-th powers of Dehn twists and separating twists, and if $g\geq 6$ and $p$ is a large enough prime then $\mathrm{Ker} \, \rho_p$ is contained in the subgroup generated by the commutator subgroup of the Johnson subgroup and by $p$-th powers of Dehn twists.</description>

      <title>$p$-curvature of periodic pencils of flat connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.00636 we introduced the notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth variety $X$. Namely, a pencil is a linear family of flat connections $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)=d-\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^ns_jB_{ij}dx_i,$
  where $\lbrace x_i\rbrace$ are coordinates on $X$ and $B_{ij}: X\to {\rm Mat}_N$ are matrix-valued regular functions. A pencil is periodic if it is generically invariant under the shifts $s_j\mapsto s_j+1$ up to isomorphism. In this paper we show that in characteristic $p&gt;0$, the $p$-curvature operators $\lbrace C_i,1\le i\le r\rbrace$ of a periodic pencil $\nabla$ are isospectral to the commuting endomorphisms $C_i^*:=\sum_{j=1}^n (s_j-s_j^p)B_{ij}^{(1)}$, where $B_{ij}^{(1)}$ is the Frobenius twist of $B_{ij}$. Using the results of arXiv:2401.00636, this allows us to compute the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature for many important examples of pencils of flat connections, including Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ), Casimir, and Dunkl connections, their confluent limits, and equivariant quantum connections for conical symplectic resolutions with finitely many torus fixed points. In particular, for rational values of parameters these eigenvalues are zero, so the connections are globally nilpotent. We also show that every periodic pencil has regular singularites. In particular, this holds for the aforementioned quantum connections if they have rational coefficients. Also we generalize these results to irregular pencils (KZ, Casimir, Dunkl, and Toda), and relate them in the Dunkl case to representations of rational Cherednik algebras. Finally, we extend our main result to pseudo-pencils and discuss the generalization to difference equations.</description>

      <title>Zeros of $S$-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of $S$-characters of finite groups was introduced by Zhmud' as a generalisation of transitive permutation characters. Any non-trivial $S$-character takes a zero value on some group element. By a deep result depending on the classification of finite simple groups a non-trivial transitive permutation character even vanishes on some element of prime power order. We present examples that this does not generalise to $S$-characters, thereby answering a question posed by J-P. Serre.</description>
