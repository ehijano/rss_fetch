      <title>Liquidity Pool Design on Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated market makers are a popular type of decentralized exchange in which users trade assets with each other directly and automatically through a liquidity pool and a fixed pricing function. The liquidity provider contributes to the liquidity pool by supplying assets to the pool and in return they earn transaction fees from traders who trade through the pool. We propose a model of optimal liquidity provision in which the risk-averse liquidity provider decides the investment proportion of wealth she would like to supply to the pool, trade in a centralized market, and consume in multiple periods. We derive the liquidity provider's optimal strategy by dynamic programming and numerically find the optimal liquidity pool that maximizes the liquidity provider's utility. Our findings indicate that the exchange rate volatility on the centralized market exerts a positive effect on the optimal transaction fee. Moreover, the optimal constant mean pricing formula is found to be related to the relative performance of the underlying assets on the centralized market.</description>

      <title>Statistical Validation of Contagion Centrality in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel centrality measure to evaluate shock propagation on financial networks capturing a notion of contagion and systemic risk contributions. In comparison to many popular centrality metrics (e.g., eigenvector centrality) which provide only a relative centrality between nodes, our proposed measure is in an absolute scale permitting comparisons of contagion risk over time. In addition, we provide a statistical validation method when the network is estimated from data, as is done in practice. This statistical test allows us to reliably assess the computed centrality values. We validate our methodology on simulated data and conduct empirical case studies using financial data. We find that our proposed centrality measure increases significantly during times of financial distress and is able to provide insights in to the (market implied) risk-levels of different firms and sectors.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volatility in Mean: Efficient Analysis by a Generalized Mixture Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the simulation-based Bayesian analysis of stochastic volatility in mean (SVM) models. Extending the highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo mixture sampler for the SV model proposed in Kim et al. (1998) and Omori et al. (2007), we develop an accurate approximation of the non-central chi-squared distribution as a mixture of thirty normal distributions. Under this mixture representation, we sample the parameters and latent volatilities in one block. We also detail a correction of the small approximation error by using additional Metropolis-Hastings steps. The proposed method is extended to the SVM model with leverage. The methodology and models are applied to excess holding yields in empirical studies, and the SVM model with leverage is shown to outperform competing volatility models based on marginal likelihoods.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for solving Black-Scholes PDEs for high-dimensional option pricing in finance and its complexity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>

      <title>Approximating Smiles: A Time Change Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for analyzing the shape of implied volatility smiles The method is applicable to common semimartingale models, such as jump-diffusion, rough volatility, and infinite activity models. We use a moment-based formula to approximate the at-the-money skew and curvature. Additionally, we explicitly approximate the volatility skew and curvature under a time change framework. We derive characteristics of skewness and curvature and explain their implications for model selection based on the approximation. The accuracy of the short-term approximation results on models is tested via numerical methods and on empirical data. The method is then applied to the calibration problem.</description>
