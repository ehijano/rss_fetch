      <title>Critical Casimir levitation of colloids above a bull's-eye pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical Casimir forces emerge among particles or surfaces immersed in a near-critical fluid, with the sign of the force determined by surface properties and with its strength tunable by minute temperature changes. Here, we show how such forces can be used to trap a colloidal particle and levitate it above a substrate with a bull's-eye pattern consisting of a ring with surface properties opposite to the rest of the substrate. Using the Derjaguin approximation and mean-field calculations, we find a rich behavior of spherical colloids at such a patterned surface, including sedimentation towards the ring and levitation above the ring (ring levitation) or above the bull's-eye's center (point levitation). Within the Derjaguin approximation, we calculate a levitation diagram for point levitation showing the depth of the trapping potential and the height at which the colloid levitates, both depending on the pattern properties, the colloid size, and the solution temperature. Our calculations reveal that the parameter space associated with point levitation shrinks if the system is driven away from a critical point, while, surprisingly, the trapping force becomes stronger. We discuss the application of critical Casimir levitation for sorting colloids by size and for determining the thermodynamic distance to criticality. Our results show that critical Casimir forces provide rich opportunities for controlling the behavior of colloidal particles at patterned surfaces.</description>

      <title>Branches, Tie Chains and Entanglements in Bimodal Polyethylene Single Crystals under Uniaxial Tensile Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and a united-monomer model of PE, single well-aligned multi-lamella PE crystals grown in previous work [ACS Macro Letters 12, 808 (2023)] are deformed uniaxially to mimic tensile testing. During deformation, the crystallinity, tie-chain segments, entanglements and folds are monitored and correlated with the stress-strain behaviour and mechanical properties. At small strains, the single well-aligned PE crystals reveal a larger Young modulus when the deformation direction is perpendicular to the global stem direction. At large strains, the memory of the initial topology plays little role in the mechanical response and is observed to be completely destroyed. Short chain branching appears to suppress disentanglement and shear induced alignment of the chains during deformation. As a result, tie-chains and entanglements persist in branched systems and the peak stress at failure is found to be proportional to the change in number of tie-chains from the beginning of the brittle break to its end. Our findings suggest the remarkable mechanical properties of bimodal branched PE result directly from tie-chains, with entanglements playing a secondary role in the mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Rigidity transitions in anisotropic networks happen in multiple steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the rigidity transition in a triangular lattice changes as a function of anisotropy by preferentially filling bonds on the lattice in one direction. We discover that the onset of rigidity in anisotropic spring networks arises in at least two steps, reminiscent of the two-step melting transition in two dimensional crystals. In particular, our simulations demonstrate that the percolation of stress-supporting bonds happens at different critical volume fractions along different directions. By examining each independent component of the elasticity tensor, we determine universal exponents and develop universal scaling functions to analyze isotropic rigidity percolation as a multicritical point. We expect that these results will be important for elucidating the underlying mechanical phase transitions governing the properties of biological materials ranging from the cytoskeletons of cells to the extracellular networks of tissues such as tendon where the networks are often preferentially aligned.</description>

      <title>Structural and dynamical investigation of glassforming smectogen by X-ray diffraction and infra-red spectroscopy aided by density functional theory calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular arrangement in the chiral smectic phases of the glassforming (S)-4'-(1-methylheptylcarbonyl)biphenyl-4-yl 4-[7-(2,2,3,3,4,4,4-heptafluorobutoxy) heptyl-1-oxy]benzoate is investigated by X-ray diffraction. An increased correlation length of the positional short-range order in the supercooled state agrees with the previous assumption of the hexatic smectic phase. However, the registered X-ray diffraction patterns are not typical for the hexatic phases. Comparison of the smectic layer spacing and optical tilt angle indicates a strongly non-linear shape of molecules, which enables choice of the molecular models obtained by DFT calculations, used subsequently to interpret the infra-red spectra. The presumption of the hexatic smectic FA* or IA* phase is supported by the splitting of the absorption bands related to the C=O stretching in the supercooled state, which is absent in the smectic CA* phase above the melting temperature. The glass transition affects the temperature dependence of the smectic layer spacing but only subtly impacts the infra-red spectra. Application of the k-means cluster analysis enables distinction between the infra-red spectra below and above the glass transition temperature, but only for certain spectral ranges.</description>

      <title>Effects of quenched disorder on the kinetics and pathways of phase transition in a soft colloidal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although impurities are unavoidable in real-world and experimental systems, most numerical studies on nucleation focus on pure (impurity-free) systems. As a result, the role of impurities in phase transitions remains poorly understood, especially for systems with complex free energy landscapes featuring one or more metastable intermediate phases. In this study, we employed Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the effects of static impurities (quenched disorder) of varying length scales and surface morphologies on the nucleation mechanism and kinetics in the Gaussian Core Model (GCM) system, a model for soft colloidal systems. We first explored how the nucleation free energy barrier and critical cluster size are influenced by the fraction of pinned particles ($f_{\rm p}$) and the pinned cluster size ($n_{\rm p}$). Both the nucleation free energy barrier and critical cluster size increase sharply with increasing $f_{\rm p}$ but decrease as $n_{\rm p}$ grows, eventually approaching the homogeneous nucleation limit. On examining the impact of surface morphology on nucleation kinetics, we observed that the nucleation barrier significantly decreases with increasing the spherical pinned cluster (referred to as "seed") size of face-centred cubic (FCC), body-centred cubic (BCC), and simple cubic (SC) structures, with BCC showing the greatest facilitation. Interestingly, seeds with random surface roughness had little effect on nucleation kinetics. Additionally, the polymorphic identity of particles in the final crystalline phase is influenced by both seed surface morphology and system size. This study further provides crucial insights into the intricate relationship between substrate-induced local structural fluctuations and the selection of the polymorphic identity in the final crystalline phase, which is essential for understanding and controlling crystallization processes in experiments.</description>

      <title>Mean square displacement of intruders in freely cooling multicomponent granular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean square displacement (MSD) of intruders (tracer particles) immersed in a multicomponent granular mixture made up of smooth inelastic hard spheres in a homogeneous cooling state is explicitly computed. The multicomponent granular mixture is constituted by $s$ species with different masses, diameters, and coefficients of restitution. In the hydrodynamic regime, the time decay of the granular temperature of the mixture gives rise to a time decay of the intruder's diffusion coefficient $D_0$. The corresponding MSD of the intruder is determined by integrating the corresponding diffusion equation. As expected from previous works on binary mixtures, we find a logarithmic time dependence of the MSD which involves the coefficient $D_0$. To analyze the dependence of the MSD on the parameter space of the system, the diffusion coefficient is explicitly determined by considering the so-called second Sonine approximation (two terms in the Sonine polynomial expansion of the intruder's distribution function). The theoretical results for $D_0$ are compared with those obtained by numerically solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. We show that the second Sonine approximation improves the predictions of the first Sonine approximation, especially when the intruders are much lighter than the particles of the granular mixture. In the long-time limit, our results for the MSD agree with those recently obtained by Bodrova [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{109}, 024903 (2024)] when $D_0$ is determined by considering the first Sonine approximation.</description>

      <title>Effective diffusion along the backbone of combs with finite-span 1D and 2D fingers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion in complex heterogeneous media such as biological tissues or porous materials typically involves constrained displacements in tortuous structures and {\em sticky} environments. Therefore, diffusing particles experience both entropic (excluded-volume) forces and the presence of complex energy landscapes. In this situation, one may describe transport through an effective diffusion coefficient. In this paper, we examine comb structures with finite-length 1D and finite-area 2D fingers, which act as purely diffusive traps. We find that there exists a critical width of 2D fingers above which the effective diffusion along the backbone is faster than for an equivalent arrangement of 1D fingers. Moreover, we show that the effective diffusion coefficient is described by a general analytical form for both 1D and 2D fingers, provided the correct scaling variable is identified as a function of the structural parameters. Interestingly, this formula corresponds to the well-known general situation of diffusion in a medium with fast reversible adsorption. Finally, we show that the same formula describes diffusion in the presence of dilute potential energy traps, e.g. through a landscape of square wells. While diffusion is ultimately always the results of microscopic interactions (with particles in the fluid, other solutes and the environment), effective representations are often of great practical use. The results reported in this paper help clarify the microscopic origins and the applicability of global, integrated descriptions of diffusion in complex media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly thirty years after its inception, the field of DNA-programmed colloidal self-assembly has begun to realize its initial promise. In this review, we summarize recent developments in designing effective interactions and understanding the dynamic self-assembly pathways of DNA-coated nanoparticles and microparticles, as well as how these advances have propelled tremendous progress in crystal engineering. We also highlight exciting new directions showing that new classes of subunits combining nanoparticles with DNA origami can be used to engineer novel multicomponent assemblies, including structures with self-limiting, finite sizes. We conclude by providing an outlook on how recent theoretical advances focusing on the kinetics of self-assembly could usher in new materials-design opportunities, like the possibility of retrieving multiple distinct target structures from a single suspension or accessing new classes of materials that are stabilized by energy dissipation, mimicking self-assembly in living systems.</description>

      <title>Inferring hyperuniformity from local structures via persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity refers to the suppression of density fluctuations at large scales. Typical for ordered systems, this property also emerges in several disordered physical and biological systems, where it is particularly relevant to understand mechanisms of pattern formation and to exploit peculiar attributes, e.g., interaction with light and transport phenomena. While hyperuniformity is a global property, it has been shown in [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023107 (2024)] that global hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with topological properties representative of local arrangements. In this work, building on this information, we explore and assess the inverse relationship between hyperuniformity and local structures in point distributions as described by persistent homology. Standard machine learning algorithms trained on persistence diagrams are shown to detect hyperuniformity with high accuracy. Therefore, we demonstrate that the information on patterns' local structure allows for inferring hyperuniformity. Then, addressing more quantitative aspects, we show that parameters defining hyperuniformity globally, for instance entering the structure factor, can be reconstructed by comparing persistence diagrams of targeted patterns with reference ones. We also explore the generation of patterns entailing given topological properties. The results of this study pave the way for advanced analysis of hyperuniform patterns including local information, and introduce basic concepts for their inverse design.</description>

      <title>Normalizing flows as an enhanced sampling method for atomistic supercooled liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normalizing flows can transform a simple prior probability distribution into a more complex target distribution. Here, we evaluate the ability and efficiency of generative machine learning methods to sample the Boltzmann distribution of an atomistic model for glass-forming liquids. This is a notoriously difficult task, as it amounts to ergodically exploring the complex free energy landscape of a disordered and frustrated many-body system. We optimize a normalizing flow model to successfully transform high-temperature configurations of a dense liquid into low-temperature ones, near the glass transition. We perform a detailed comparative analysis with established enhanced sampling techniques developed in the physics literature to assess and rank the performance of normalizing flows against state-of-the-art algorithms. We demonstrate that machine learning methods are very promising, showing a large speedup over conventional molecular dynamics. Normalizing flows show performances comparable to parallel tempering and population annealing, while still falling far behind the swap Monte Carlo algorithm. Our study highlights the potential of generative machine learning models in scientific computing for complex systems, but also points to some of its current limitations and the need for further improvement.</description>

      <title>Manipulating crack formation in air-dried clay suspensions with tunable elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clay, the major ingredient of natural soils, is often used as a rheological modifier while formulating paints and coatings. When subjected to desiccation, colloidal clay suspensions and clayey soils crack due to the accumulation of drying-induced stresses. Even when desiccation is suppressed, aqueous clay suspensions exhibit physical aging, with their elastic and viscous moduli increasing over time as their microscopic structures evolve due to time-dependent inter-particle screened electrostatic interactions. The rate at which aging progresses is estimated from the rate of evolution of the mechanical moduli and can be controlled by changing clay concentration or by incorporating additives. Since physical aging and evaporation should both contribute to the consolidation of drying clay suspensions, we attempt to manipulate the desiccation process \textit{via} alterations of clay and additive concentrations. For a desiccating sample with an accelerated rate of aging, we observe faster consolidation into a semi-solid state and earlier onset of cracks. We estimate the crack onset time, $t_c$, in direct visualization experiments and the elasticity of the drying sample layer, $E$, using microindentation in an atomic force microscope. We demonstrate that $t_c \propto \sqrt{\frac{G_c}{E}}$, where $G_c$, the fracture energy, is estimated by fitting our experimental data to a linear poroelastic model that incorporates the Griffith's criterion for crack formation. Our work demonstrates that early crack onset is associated with lower sample ductility. The correlation between crack onset in a sample and its mechanical properties as uncovered here is potentially useful in preparing crack-resistant coatings and diverse clay structures.</description>

      <title>Capillary sorting of fiber suspensions by dip coating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sorting elongated anisotropic particles, such as fibers, dispersed in suspensions poses significant challenges as they present two characteristic dimensions: length and diameter. Fibers in suspension usually align with the flow, leading to diameter-based filtration when passing through a sieve. Modifying the flow conditions by introducing more mixing so that fibers are arbitrarily oriented can lead to sorting by diameter and length simultaneously, resulting in a lower filtration quality. In this paper, we demonstrate that capillary filtration by dip coating can be utilized to selectively sort fibers by length or by diameter in a controlled manner. Using the withdrawal of a flat substrate from a fiber suspension, we demonstrate that fibers are primarily sorted by their diameters. When considering cylindrical substrates, fibers can be sorted by length under appropriate conditions due to the orientation adopted by the fibers during their entrainment. We report guidelines for designing this filtration process and obtaining good sorting efficiency.</description>

      <title>Ohta-Kawasaki energy for amphiphiles: asymptotics and phase-field simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the minimizers of a degenerate case of the Ohta-Kawasaki energy, defined as the sum of the perimeter and a Coulombic nonlocal term. We start by investigating radially symmetric candidates which give us insights into the asymptotic behaviors of energy minimizers in the large mass limit. In order to numerically study the problems that are analytically challenging, we propose a phase-field reformulation which is shown to Gamma-converge to the original sharp interface model. Our phase-field simulations and asymptotic results suggest that the energy minimizers exhibit behaviors similar to the self-assembly of amphiphiles, including the formation of lipid bilayer membranes.</description>
