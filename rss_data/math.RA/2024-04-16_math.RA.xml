      <title>Centroid and algebraic properties of evolution algebras through graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leitmotiv of this paper is linking algebraic properties of an evolution algebra with combinatorial properties of the (possibly several) graphs that one can associate to the algebra. We link nondegeneracy, zero annihilator, absorption property, von Neumann regularity, and primeness with suitable properties in the associated graph. In the presence of semiprimeness, the property of primeness is equivalent to any associated graph being downward directed. We also provide a description of the prime ideals in an evolution algebra and prove that certain algebraic properties, such as semiprimeness and perfection, can not be characterized in combinatorial terms.
  We describe the centroid of evolution algebras as constant functions along the connected components of its associated graph. The dimension of the centroid of a zero annihilator algebra $A$ agrees with the cardinal of the connected components of any possible graph associated to $A$. This is the combinatorial expression of an algebraic uniqueness property in the decomposition of $A$ as indecomposable algebras with $1$-dimensional centroid.</description>

      <title>Mal'tsev products of varieties, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Mal'tsev product $\mathcal{V} \circ \mathcal{W}$ of two varieties $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ of the same similarity type. Such a product is usually a quasivariety but not necessarily a variety. We give an equational base for the variety generated by $\mathcal{V} \circ \mathcal{W}$ in terms of identities satisfied in $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{W}$. Then the main result provides a new sufficient condition for $\mathcal{V} \circ \mathcal{W}$ to be a variety: If $\mathcal{W}$ is an idempotent variety and there are terms $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ such that $\mathcal{W}$ satisfies the identity $f(x,y) = g(x,y)$ and $\mathcal{V}$ satisfies the identities $f(x,y) = x$ and $g(x,y) = y$, then $\mathcal{V} \circ \mathcal{W}$ is a variety. We also provide a number of examples and applications of this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mal'tsev product of two varieties of the same similarity type is not in general a variety, because it can fail to be closed under homomorphic images. In the previous paper we provided a new sufficient condition for such a product to be a variety. In this paper we extend that result by weakening the assumptions regarding the two varieties. We also explore the various special cases of our new result and provide a number of examples of its application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first propose the concepts of BiHom-$\Omega$-associative algebras, BiHom-$\Omega$-dendriform algebras, BiHom-$\Omega$-pre-Lie algebras and BiHom-$\Omega$-Lie algebras. We then obtain a new BiHom-$\Omega$-associative (resp. Lie) algebra by defining a new multiplication on a BiHom-$\Omega$-associative (resp. Lie) algebra with the Rota-Baxter family of weight $\lambda$.In addition, we generalize the classical relationships of associative algebras, pre-Lie algebras, dendriform algebras and Lie algebras to the BiHom-$\Omega$ version.</description>

      <title>Quotient Modules of Finite Length and Their Relation to Fredholm Elements in Semiprime Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: B. A. Barnes introduced so-called Fredholm elements in a semiprime ring whose definition is inspired by Atkinson's theorem. Here the socle of a semiprime ring generalizes the ideal of finite-rank operators on a Banach space. In this paper, we aim to see that the algebraic concept of the length of a module is strongly related to that of Fredholm elements. This motivates another generalization of Fredholm elements by requiring for an element $a\in\mathcal{A}$ that the $\mathcal{A}$-modules of the form $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{A} a$ and $\mathcal{A}/a\mathcal{A}$ are of finite length. We are particularly interested in sufficient conditions for our generalized Fredholm elements to be Fredholm. In a unital C$^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ we shall even see that an element $a\in\mathcal{A}$ is Fredholm if and only if the $\mathcal{A}$-modules $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{A} a$ and $\mathcal{A}/a\mathcal{A}$ both have finite length.</description>

      <title>Skew two-sided bracoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isabel Martin-Lyons and Paul J.Truman generalized the definition of a skew brace to give a new algebraic object, which they termed a skew bracoid. Their construction involves two groups interacting in a manner analogous to the compatibility condition found in the definition of a skew brace. They formulated tools for characterizing and classifying skew bracoids, and studied substructures and quotients of skew bracoids. In this paper we study two-sided bracoids. In \cite{WR07} Rump showed that if a left brace $(B, \star ,\cdot )$ is a two-sided brace and the operation $\ast : B \times B \longrightarrow B$ is defined by $a \ast b = a\cdot b \star \overline{a} \star \overline{b}$ for all $a, b \in B$ then $(B, \star ,\ast )$ is a Jacobson radical ring. Lau showed that if $(B, \star ,\cdot )$ is a left brace and the operation is asssociative, then $B$ is a two-sided brace. We will prove bracoid versions of this results.</description>

      <title>Strong Resolving Graphs of Clean Graphs of Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring with unity. The clean graph $\text{Cl}(R)$ of a ring $R$ is the simple undirected graph whose vertices are of the form $(e,u)$, where $e$ is an idempotent element and $u$ is a unit of the ring $R$ and two vertices $(e,u)$, $(f,v)$ of $\text{Cl}(R)$ are adjacent if and only if $ef = fe =0$ or $uv = vu=1$. In this manuscript, for a commutative ring $R$, first we obtain the strong resolving graph of $\text{Cl}(R)$ and its independence number. Using them, we determine the strong metric dimension of the clean graph of an arbitrary commutative ring. As an application, we compute the strong metric dimension of $\text{Cl}(R)$, where $R$ is a commutative Artinian ring.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, first we revisit the formal integration of Lie algebras, which give rise to braces in some special cases. Then we establish the formal integration theory for complete Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, that is, we show that there is a Rota-Baxter group with the underlying group structure given by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, associated to any complete Rota-Baxter Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Binary bi-braces and applications to cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a XOR-based alternating block cipher the plaintext is masked by a sequence of layers each performing distinct actions: a highly nonlinear permutation, a linear transformation, and the bitwise key addition. When assessing resistance against classical differential attacks (where differences are computed with respect to XOR), the cryptanalysts must only take into account differential probabilities introduced by the nonlinear layer, this being the only one whose differential transitions are not deterministic. The temptation of computing differentials with respect to another difference operation runs into the difficulty of understanding how differentials propagate through the XOR-affine levels of the cipher. In this paper we introduce a special family of braces that enable the derivation of a set of differences whose interaction with every layer of an XOR-based alternating block cipher can be understood. We show that such braces can be described also in terms of alternating binary algebras of nilpotency class two. Additionally, we present a method to compute the automorphism group of these structures through an equivalence between bilinear maps. By doing so, we characterise the XOR-linear permutations for which the differential transitions with respect to the new difference are deterministic, facilitating an alternative differential attack.</description>

      <title>Generalization the parameters of minimal linear codes over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, We introduce a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a linear code to achieve minimality when analyzed over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$. The fundamental inquiry in minimal linear codes is the existence of a $[n,k]$ minimal linear code where $k$ is less than or equal to $n$. W. Lu et al. ( see \cite{nine}) showed that there exists a positive integer $n(k;q)$ such that for $n\geq n(k;q)$ a minimal linear code of length $n$ and dimension $k$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ must exist. They give the upper and lower bound of $n(k;q)$. In this manuscript, we establish both an upper and lower bound for $n(k;p^l)$ within the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a combinatorial formula for the coproduct in a Hopf algebra of decorated multi-indices which recently appeared in the literature, which can be briefly described as the graded dual of the enveloping algebra of the free Novikov algebra generated by the set of decorations. Similarly to what happens for the Hopf algebra of rooted forests, the formula can be written in terms of admissible cuts.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetic of the join rings over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a collection $\{ G_i\}_{i=1}^d$ of finite groups and a ring $R$, we have previously introduced and studied certain foundational properties of the join ring $\mathcal{J}_{G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_d}(R)$. This ring bridges two extreme worlds: matrix rings $M_n(R)$ on one end, and group rings $R[G]$ on the other. The construction of this ring was motivated by various problems in graph theory, network theory, nonlinear dynamics, and neuroscience. In this paper, we continue our investigations of this ring, focusing more on its arithmetic properties. We begin by constructing a generalized augmentation map that gives a structural decomposition of this ring. This decomposition allows us to compute the zeta function of the join of group rings. We show that the join of group rings is a natural home for studying the concept of simultaneous primitive roots for a given set of primes. This concept is related to the order of the unit group of the join of group rings. Finally, we characterize the join of group rings over finite fields with the property that the order of every unit divides a fixed number. Remarkably, Mersenne and Fermat primes unexpectedly emerge within the context of this exploration.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a cohomological study of modified Rota-Baxter associative algebras in the presence of derivations. The Modified Rota-Baxter operator, which is a modified version and closely related to the classical Rota-Baxter operator, has garnered significant attention due to its applications in various mathematical and physical contexts. In this study, we define a cohomology theory and also investigate a one-parameter formal deformation theory and abelian extensions of modified Rota-Baxter associative algebras under the influence of derivations.</description>

      <title>Relative Auslander--Gorenstein Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study relative Auslander--Gorenstein pairs. This consists of a finite-dimensional Gorenstein algebra together with a self-orthogonal module that provides a further homological feature of the algebra in terms of relative dominant dimension. These pairs will be called relative Auslander pairs whenever the algebra in question has finite global dimension. We characterize relative Auslander pairs by the existence and uniqueness of tilting-cotilting modules having higher values relative dominant and codominant dimension with respect to the self-orthogonal module. The same characterisation remains valid for relative Auslander--Gorenstein pairs if the self-orthogonal module has injective or projective dimension at most one. Our relative approach generalises and unifies the known results from the literature, for instance, the characterization of minimal Auslander--Gorenstein algebras. As an application of our methods, we prove that for any relative Auslander pair pieces of the module category of the endomorphism algebra of the self-orthogonal module can be identified with pieces of the module category of the endomorphism algebra of the unique tilting-cotilting module associated with the relative Auslander pair. We provide explicit examples of relative Auslander pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a ring $R$, we have a classical result stating that the ordinary category of modules is the abelianization of the category of augmented $R$-algebras. Analogously, using the framework of infinity categories and higher algebra, Francis showed that the infinity category of $R$-modules is the {\em stabilization} of the infinity category of augmented $R$-algebras. In this work we show a dual result for coalgebras over a cooperad $Q$: namely that given a coalgebra $C$, comodules over $C$ are the costabilization of coalgebras over $C$, which is the universal stable category with a finite colimit preserving functor to coalgebras over $C$.</description>
