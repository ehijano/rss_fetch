      <title>Fox's $\mathbb{Z}$-colorings and twelve equivalence relations on $\mathbb{Z}^m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define twelve equivalence relations on $\mathbb{Z}^{m}$ ($m\geq2$) by means of Fox's $\mathbb{Z}$-colorings of (classical, virtual, or pure) $m$-braids and $(m,m)$-tangles. One of them corresponds to the Hurwitz action of the $m$-braid group on $\mathbb{Z}^m$. The aim of this paper is to characterize the equivalence relations completely. As an application, we construct an invariant $d(G)$ of a spatial Euler graph $G$, and give the calculation for some family of spatial $\theta_4$-graphs.</description>

      <title>Iso-length-spectral Hyperbolic Surface Amalgams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two negatively curved metric spaces are iso-length-spectral if they have the same multisets of lengths of closed geodesics. A well-known paper by Sunada provides a systematic way of constructing iso-length-spectral surfaces that are not isometric. In this paper, we construct examples of iso-length-spectral surface amalgams that are not isometric, generalizing Buser's combinatorial construction of Sunada's surfaces. We find both homeormophic and non-homeomorphic pairs. Finally, we construct a noncommensurable pair with the same weak length spectrum, the length set without multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Towards the methodology for solving the minimum enclosing ball and related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methodology is provided towards the solution of the minimum enclosing ball problem. This problem concerns the determination of the unique spherical surface of smallest radius enclosing a given bounded set in the d-dimensional Euclidean space. Mathematical formulation and typical methods for solving this problem are presented. Also, the paper is focused on areas that are related to this problem, namely: (a) promise problems and property testing, (b) theorems for partitioning and enclosing (covering) a set, and (c) computation of the diameter of a set.</description>

      <title>Khovanov homology and quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error-correcting codes for quantum computing are crucial to address the fundamental problem of communication in the presence of noise and imperfections. Audoux used Khovanov homology to define families of quantum error-correcting codes with desirable properties. We explore Khovanov homology and some of its many extensions, namely reduced, annular, and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ homology, to generate new families of quantum codes and to establish several properties about codes that arise in this way, such as behavior of distance under Reidemeister moves or connected sums.</description>

      <title>Odd Khovanov homology, higher representation theory and higher rewriting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is devoted to the fields of quantum topology and rewriting theory, and their surprising interconnections. In the first part of the thesis, we develop a higher representation theoretic approach to odd Khovanov homology; this is the content of arXiv:2311.14394. One of the essential ingredients is a certain graded-2-category of graded $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams. In the second part of the thesis, we develop a rewriting theory suitable for higher algebras and their super or graded analogues, and use it to show a basis theorem for graded $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams. These techniques have the potential to be applied to a wide variety of contexts. Both parts of the thesis can be read independently. Each has its own comprehensive introduction, allowing experts from one field to get acquainted with the other field.</description>

      <title>Recovering contact forms from boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact connected smooth manifold with boundary. The paper deals with contact $1$-forms $\beta$ on $X$, whose Reeb vector fields $v_\beta$ admit Lyapunov functions $f$. We prove that any odd-dimensional $X$ admits such a contact form.
  We tackle the question: how to recover $X$ and $\beta$ from the appropriate data along the boundary $\partial X$? We describe such boundary data and prove that they allow for a reconstruction of the pair $(X, \beta)$, up to a diffeomorphism of $X$. We use the term ``holography" for the reconstruction. We say that objects or structures inside $X$ are {\it holographic}, if they can be reconstructed from their $v_\beta$-flow induced ``shadows" on the boundary $\partial X$.
  We also introduce numerical invariants that measure how ``wrinkled" the boundary $\partial X$ is with respect to the $v_\beta$-flow and study their holographic properties under the contact forms preserving embeddings of equidimensional contact manifolds with boundary. We get some ``non-squeezing results" about such contact embedding, which are reminiscent of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem in symplectic geometry.</description>
