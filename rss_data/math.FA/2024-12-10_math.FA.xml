      <title>Generalized Separation of Collections of Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the existing generalized separation statements including the conventional extremal principle and its extensions differ {in the ways norms on product spaces are defined}. We prove a general separation statement with arbitrary product norms covering the existing results of this kind. The proof is divided into a series of claims and exposes the key steps and arguments used when proving generalized separation statements. As an application, we prove dual necessary (sufficient) conditions for an abstract product norm extension of the approximate stationarity (transversality) property.</description>

      <title>Weighted Shift operators on spaces of analytic functions over an annulus -- I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a study of the forward weighted shift operator, denoted by $F_w$, defined on the Banach spaces $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ and $c_{0,a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ of analytic functions on a suitable annulus $\mathtt{A}$ in the complex plane. Here, $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ and $c_{0,a.b}(\mathtt{A})$, respectively, are the spaces of analytic functions on some annulus $\mathtt{A}$, having normalized Schauder bases of the form $\{(a_n+b_nz)z^n, ~~n\in \mathbb{Z}\}$, which are equivalent to the standard basis in $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$ and $c_0(\mathbb{Z})$. We first obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for $F_w$ to be bounded, and then we primarily study when $F_w$ and its adjoint $F_w^*$ are hypercyclic, supercyclic, and chaotic. It is proved that, under certain conditions on $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$, the operator $F_w$ similar to a compact perturbation of a classical bilateral weighted shift on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$. Unlike the case of classical weighted shifts, the adjoint operator $F_w^*$ on the dual of $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ can have non-trivial periodic vectors, without being even hypercyclic. The zero-one law of orbital limit points fails for $F_w^*$.</description>

      <title>Fourier Series for Two-Dimensional Singular-Fibered Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study 2D Fourier expansions for a general class of planar measures $\mu$, generally singular, but assumed compactly supported in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We focus on the following question: When does $L^2(\mu)$ admit a 2D system of Fourier expansions? We offer concrete conditions allowing an affirmative answer to the question for a large class of Borel probability measures, and we present an explicit Fourier duality for these cases. Our 2D Fourier analysis relies on a detailed conditioning-analysis. For a given $\mu$, it is based on the corresponding systems of 1D measures consisting of a marginal measure and associated family of conditional measures computed from $\mu$ by the Rokhlin Disintegration Theorem. Our identified $L^2(\mu)$-Fourier expansions are special in two ways: For our measures $\mu$, the Fourier expansions are generally non-orthogonal, but nonetheless, they lend themselves to algorithmic computations. Second, we further stress that our class of 2D measures $\mu$ considered here go beyond what exists in the literature. In particular, our measures do not require affine iterated function system (IFS) properties, but we do study grid IFS measures in detail and provide some technical criteria guaranteeing their admission of Fourier expansions. Our analyses make use of estimates for the Hausdorff dimensions of the measure supports. An important class of examples addressed in this paper is fractal Bedford-McMullen carpets.</description>

      <title>On the problem of optimal fair exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal exchange which can be formulated as a kind of optimal transportation problem. The existence of an optimal solution and a duality theorem for the optimal exchange problem are proved in case of completely regular topological spaces. We show the connection between the problem of optimal exchange and the optimal transportation problem with density constraints. With the use of this connection we obtain a formula for the optimal value in the problem of optimal exchange.</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>

      <title>An Operator Theoretic Approach to Birkhoff's Problem 111</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1946, Garrett Birkhoff proved that the $n\times n$ doubly stochastic matrices comprise the convex hull of the $n\times n$ permutation matrices, which in turn make up the extreme points of this polytope. He proposed his problem 111, which asks whether there exists a topology on infinite matrices for which this applies to the closed convex hull of the $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ permutation matrices. As Isbell showed in 1955, this equality is not achieved in the line-sum norm. In this paper, we use the domain of operator theory, and its many topologies, to improve on his negative result by showing that Birkhoff's problem is not solved in any of these topologies. In Kendall's 1960 paper on this problem, he gave an answer to the affirmative, as well as a topology for which closed convex hull comprises the doubly substochastic matrices. We also show that Kendall's secondary theorem also applies for all the locally convex Hausdorff topologies finer than than Kendall's (namely that of entry-wise convergence) which make the continuous dual of the matrix space no larger than the predual of the von Neumann algebra containing them. We then show that this is a theoretical upper limit topologies with this closure property. We also discuss the exposed points of this hull for these several topologies. Moreover, we show that, in these topologies, the closed affine hull of these permutation matrices comprise all operators with real-entry matrix coefficients.</description>

      <title>Quantization and the Resolvent Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.04819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel commutative C*-algebra $C_\mathcal{R}(X)$ of functions on a symplectic vector space $(X,\sigma)$ admitting a complex structure, along with a strict deformation quantization that maps a dense subalgebra of $C_\mathcal{R}(X)$ to the resolvent algebra introduced by Buchholz and Grundling [JFA, 2008]. The associated quantization map is a field-theoretical Weyl quantization compatible with the work of Binz, Honegger and Rieckers [AHPO, 2004]. We also define a Berezin-type quantization map on all of $C_\mathcal{R}(X)$, which continuously and injectively maps it onto a dense subset of the resolvent algebra.
  The commutative resolvent algebra $C_\mathcal{R}(X)$, generally defined on a real inner product space $X$, intimately depends on the finite dimensional subspaces of $X$. We thoroughly analyze the structure of this algebra in the finite dimensional case by giving a characterization of its elements and by computing its Gelfand spectrum.</description>

      <title>On Minkowski symmetrizations of $\alpha$-concave functions and related applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Minkowski symmetral of an $\alpha$-concave function is introduced, and some of its fundamental properties are derived. It is shown that for a given $\alpha$-concave function, there exists a sequence of Minkowski symmetrizations that hypo-converges to its ``hypo-symmetrization". As an application, it is shown that the hypo-symmetrization of a log-concave function $f$ is always harder to approximate than $f$ by ``inner log-linearizations" with a fixed number of break points. This is a functional analogue of the classical geometric result which states that among all convex bodies of a given mean width, a Euclidean ball is hardest to approximate by inscribed polytopes with a fixed number of vertices. Finally, a general extremal property of the hypo-symmetrization is deduced, which includes a Urysohn-type inequality and the aforementioned approximation result as special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first present an abstract principle for the interchange of infimization and integration over spaces of mappings taking values in topological spaces. New conditions on the underlying space and the integrand are then introduced to convert this principle into concrete scenarios that are shown to capture those of various existing interchange rules. These results are leveraged to improve state-of-the-art interchange rules for evaluating Legendre conjugates, subdifferentials, recessions, Moreau envelopes, and proximity operators of integral functions by bringing the corresponding operations under the integral sign.</description>

      <title>Leaf as a convex domain containing eigenvalues of an endomorphism on a real inner product space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01612v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a subset of the upper half plane associated with an endomorphism of a real inner product space, and call this subset the leaf. In the case that the dimension of the space is at least $3$, the leaf is a Poincar\'e convex, and contains all eigenvalues with nonnegative imaginary part. Moreover, the leaf of a normal endomorphism is the minimum convex domain containing all eigenvalues with nonnegative imaginary part. Numerical range is a well-known convex domain containing all eigenvalues. Even though leaf is only defined for each endomorphism on $\mathbb R$, it is still expected to have an advantage over numerical range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the concept of classical spectral triples by extending the framework from Hilbert spaces to $L^p$-spaces, and from C*-algebras to $L^p$-operator algebras, $p \in [1, \infty)$. Specifically, we construct $L^p$-spectral triples for reduced group $L^p$-operator algebras and for $L^p$ UHF-algebras of infinite tensor product type. Furthermore, inspired by Christensen and Ivan's construction of a Dirac operator on AF C*-algebras, we provide an $L^p$ version of this construction for $L^p$ UHF-algebras. This leads to the construction of a $p$-quantum compact metric space structure on the state space of the $L^p$ UHF-algebra.</description>

      <title>Sharp Matrix Empirical Bernstein Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two sharp empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent method termed as iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD) method to solve nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method converges to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) based on the method suggested by Hanke and Raus, and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR. Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any a-priori knowledge of the noise level. We show that the method terminates in finitely many steps in case of noisy data and has regularizing features. Further, we discuss the convergence rates of the method using well-known source and other related conditions under HPCR as well as discrepancy principle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes both the regularization properties and convergence rates of a stochastic gradient method using a heuristic type rule in the setting of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Finally, we provide the numerical experiments to showcase the practical efficacy of the proposed method.</description>
