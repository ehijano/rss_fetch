      <title>B2 1308+326: a changing-look blazar or not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous study, we identified a shift in the synchrotron peak frequency of the blazar B2 1308$+$326 from 10$^{12.9}$ Hz to 10$^{14.8}$ Hz during a flare, suggesting it could be a changing-look blazar (CLB). In this work, we investigate the CL behaviour of B2 1308+326 by analysing a newly acquired optical spectrum and comparing it with an archival spectrum. We find that between the two epochs, the continuum flux increased by a factor of $\sim$4.4, while the Mg II emission line flux decreased by a factor of 1.4$\pm$0.2. Additionally, the equivalent width of the Mg II line reduced from $\sim 20$ \AA \ to $\sim 3$ \AA, indicating an apparent shift from a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) class to a BL Lacertae (BL Lac) class. Despite this apparent change, the ratio of accretion disk luminosity to Eddington luminosity remains $&gt;$ 10$^{-2}$ during both epochs, indicating efficient accretion persists in B2 1308$+$326. The measured black hole mass remains consistent with an average $\log M_{\rm BH} = 8.44$ M$_{\odot}$. Our findings suggest that B2 1308$+$326 is not a genuine CLB, but rather an intrinsic FSRQ that emerges as a BL Lac during high-flux states due to enhanced non-thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Spectral Energy Distribution Variability of the Blazar OJ 287 during 2009-2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using nearly simultaneous radio, near-infrared, optical, and ultraviolet data collected since 2009, we constructed 106 spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the blazar OJ 287. These SEDs were well-fitted by a log-parabolic model. By classifying the data into `flare' and `quiescent' segments, we found that the median flux at peak frequency of the SEDs during flare segments was 0.37$\pm$0.22 dex higher compared to quiescent segments, while no significant differences were observed in the median values of the curvature parameter $b$ or the peak frequency $\log \nu_{\mathrm{p}}$. A significant bluer-when-brighter trend was confirmed through a relation between $V$ magnitude and $B-V$ color index, with this trend being stronger in the flare segments. Additionally, a significant anti-correlation was detected between $\log \nu_{\mathrm{p}}$ and $b$, with a slope of 5.79 in the relation between $1/b$ and $\log \nu_{\mathrm{p}}$, closer to the prediction from a statistical acceleration model other than a stochastic acceleration interpretation, though a notable discrepancy persists. This discrepancy indicates that additional factors, such as deviations from idealized conditions or radiative contributions-such as thermal emission from the accretion disk in the optical-UV range during quiescent states-may play a role in producing the observed steeper slope. Within the framework of statistical acceleration mechanism, lack of correlation between change in peak intensity and change in peak frequency suggests that change in electron energy distribution is unlikely to be responsible for the time-dependent SED changes. Instead, changes in Doppler boosting or magnetic fields may have a greater influence.</description>

      <title>Multiband Optical Variability of the Blazar 3C 454.3 on Diverse Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its peculiar and highly variable nature, the blazar 3C 454.3 has been extensively monitored by the WEBT team. Here, we present for the first time these long-term optical flux and color variability results using data acquired in B, V, R, and I bands over a time span of $\sim$ 2 decades. We include data from WEBT collaborators and public archives such as SMARTS, Steward Observatory, and ZTF. The data are binned and segmented to study the source over this long term when more regular sampling was available. During our study, the long-term spectral variability reveals a redder when brighter (RWB) trend, which, however, stabilizes at a particular brightness cutoff $\sim$ 14.5 mag in the I-band, after which it saturates and evolves into a complex state. This trend indicates increasing jet emission dominance over accretion disk emission until jet emission completely dominates. Plots of the spectral index variation (following $F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$) reveal a bimodal distribution using a one-day binning. These correlate with two extreme phases of 3C 454.3, an outburst or high flux state and quiescent or low flux state, which are respectively jet and accretion disk dominated. We have also conducted intra-day variability studies of nine light curves and found that six of them are variable. Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) analysis between different optical waveband pairs peak at zero lags, indicating co-spatial emission in different optical bands.</description>

      <title>Revisiting radio variability of the blazar 3C 454.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine lengthy radio light curves of the flat spectrum radio galaxy 3C 454.3 for possible quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). The data used in this work were collected at five radio frequencies, 4.8, 8.0, 14.5, 22.0, and 37.0 GHz between 1979--2013 as observed at the University of Michigan Radio Astronomical Observatory, Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, and Aalto University Mets{\"a}hovi Radio Observatory. We employ generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet transform analyses to search for periodicities in these light curves. We confirm a QPO period of $\sim$ 2000 day to be at least 4$\sigma$ significant using both methods at all five radio frequencies between 1979 and 2007, after which a strong flare changed the character of the light curve. We also find a $\sim$~600 day period which is at least 4$\sigma$ significant, but only in the 22.0 and 37.0 GHz light curves. We briefly discuss physical mechanisms capable of producing such variations.</description>

      <title>Energy-resolved pulse profile changes in V 0332+53: indications for cyclotron wings emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to investigate profile changes at the cyclotron line energy of the accreting X-ray pulsar V 0332+53 by means of the analysis of its energy-resolved pulse profile behaviour, using the full set of available NuSTAR observations. We apply a tailored pipeline to study the energy dependence of the pulse profiles and to build the pulsed fraction spectra (PFS) for the different observations. We study the profile changes also using cross-correlation and lag spectra. We re-analyse the energy spectra to search for links between the local features observed in the PFS and spectral emission components associated with the shape of the fundamental cyclotron line. In the PFS data, with sufficiently high statistics, we observe a consistent behaviour around the cyclotron line energy. Specifically, two Gaussian-shaped features appear symmetrically on either side of the putative cyclotron line. These features exhibit minimal variation with source luminosity, and their peak positions consistently remain on the left and right of the cyclotron line energy. We interpret these features as evidence for cyclotron emission wings (also referred to as shoulders), as predicted by theoretical models of line formation for resonant cyclotron absorption and its propagation along the observer's line of sight. A phase-resolved analysis of the pulse in the energy bands surrounding these features enables us to determine both the spectral shape and the intensity of the photons responsible for these peaks in the PFS. Assuming these features correspond to a spectral component, we use their shapes as priors for the corresponding emission components finding a statistically satisfactorily description of the spectra. To explain these results, we propose that our line of sight is close to the direction of the spin axis, while the magnetic axis is likely orthogonal to it.</description>

      <title>On the correlation between X-rays and TeV gamma-rays in HBL Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gamma-ray emission in blazars can be attributed to the leptonic Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) model, photo-hadronic interactions, or a combination thereof. While evidence supports both models, their specific contributions remain uncertain. One supportive piece of evidence for the SSC model is the correlation between synchrotron and SSC fluxes in some blazar's Spectral Energy Distribution (SED), indicating the relative contributions of leptonic and hadronic mechanisms. Observational studies of the HBL blazar Markarian 421 over several years, spanning TeV gamma rays and X-rays, have reported a linear correlation across various timescales, which breaks at the highest gamma-ray fluxes. Extending this analysis to four High synchrotron peaked BL Lac (HBL) blazars -- Markarian 501, 1ES 1959+650, PKS 2155-304 and 1ES 2344+514.-- we utilize multiwavelength data from ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) for gamma rays and satellite observations for X-rays. Our long-term study confirms a linear correlation between fluxes across these energy bands, except for Markarian 501, which shows a correlation index of $1.45 \pm 0.01$. Notably, the exceptional flaring episode of PKS 2155-304 exhibits a correlation index of 2 with extreme values of gamma-ray fluxes. We observe outliers with high gamma-ray fluxes, suggesting the involvement of another mechanism, either of hadronic or leptonic origin. Finally, all other correlations exhibit alignment with a general correlation, suggesting a common acceleration mechanism among them with slight variations likely due to individual magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>AstroSat timing and spectral analysis of the accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17591--2342</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IGR J17591--2342, a transient accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar, was discovered during its 2018 outburst. Here, we present a timing and spectral analysis of the source using {\it AstroSat} data of the same outburst. From the timing analysis, we obtain updated values of binary orbital parameters, which reveal an average pulsar spin frequency of 527.4256984(8) Hz. The pulse profiles can be fit well with four harmonically related sinusoidal components with fractional amplitudes of fundamental and second, third, and fourth harmonics as $\sim13$\%, $\sim$6\%, $\sim$0.9\%, $\sim$0.2\%, respectively. The energy-dependent study of pulse profiles in the range of $3-20$ keV shows that the fractional amplitude of both the fundamental and first overtone is consistent with being constant across the considered energy band. Besides, a decaying trend has been observed for both the fundamental and first overtone in the phase-delay versus energy relation resulting in soft X-ray (2.8-3.3 keV) phase lags of $\sim$0.05 and $\sim$0.13 with respect to $\leq 15$ keV photons, for the fundamental and first overtone, respectively. The combined spectra from the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters and the Soft X-ray Telescope aboard {\it AstroSat} in the $1-18$ keV range can be fit well with an absorbed model consisting of a Comptonization, a blackbody and a Gaussian emission line component yielding as best-fit parameters a blackbody seed photon temperature $kT_{\rm bb}$ $\sim 0.95 \pm 0.03$ keV, and an electron temperature $kT_{\rm e}$ $\sim 1.54 \pm0.03$ keV. The spectral aspects suggest the scattering of photons from the accretion disc or the neutron star's surface.</description>

      <title>A UV to X-ray view of soft excess in type 1 AGNs: I. sample selection and spectral profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core sample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs with simultaneous XMM-Newton X-ray and UV observations is compiled from archive to probe the nature of soft X-ray excess (SE). In the first paper of this series, our focus centers on scrutinizing the spectral profile of the soft excess. Of the sources, $\approx$ 71% (42/59) exhibit powerlaw-like (po-like) soft excess, while $\approx$ 29% (17/59) exhibit blackbody-like (bb-like) soft excess. We show a cut-off powerlaw could uniformly characterize both types of soft excesses, with median Ecut of 1.40 keV for po-like and 0.14 keV for bb-like. For the first time, we report a robust and quantitative correlation between the SE profile and SE strength (the ratio of SE luminosity to that of the primary powerlaw continuum in 0.5 - 2.0 keV), indicating that stronger soft excess is more likely to be po-like, or effectively has a higher Ecut. This correlation cannot be explained by ionized disk reflection alone, which produces mostly bb-like soft excess (Ecut $\sim$ 0.1 keV) as revealed by relxilllp simulation. Remarkably, we show with simulations that a toy hybrid scenario, where both ionized disk reflection (relxilllp, with all reflection parameters fixed at default values except for ionization of the disk) and warm corona (compTT, with temperature fixed at 1 keV) contribute to the observed soft excess, can successfully reproduce the observed correlation. This highlights the ubiquitous hybrid nature of the soft X-ray excess in AGNs, and underscores the importance of considering both components while fitting the spectra of soft excess.</description>

      <title>Timing of Seven Isolated Pulsars in the Globular Cluster Terzan 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters host large populations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) due to their high gravitational encounter rates, producing many binary systems and thus MSPs via the recycling process. Seven pulsars with spin periods ranging from 3 ms to 134 ms have been discovered in Terzan 1, which was targeted for pulsar searches with the Green Bank Telescope after Australia Telescope Compact Array imaging revealed steep-spectrum point sources in the cluster core. We have obtained timing observations over seven years, for the first seven Green Bank Telescope (GBT) discoveries (Terzan 1 A through G), using the GBT and Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. All seven pulsars are isolated, consistent with Terzan 1's classification as a core-collapsed cluster (core collapse is predicted to disrupt, or ionize, binaries). With these timing solutions, we measured the positions and observed period derivatives, dP/dt, for each pulsar. The measured dP/dt values are composed of intrinsic spin-down and accelerations experienced by the pulsars (primarily from the cluster's gravitational potential), and they can be used to infer line-of-sight accelerations. We attempted to constrain the radius and density of the cluster core using these inferred accelerations. A wide range of radii and densities are possible, pointing to the need for continued timing as well as new discoveries to better constrain these cluster properties. We additionally find that Ter 1 A may be younger than the cluster and thus may have formed via a formation channel other than a core-collapse supernova. Theoretical formation mechanisms such as electron-capture supernovae from accretion- or merger-induced collapse of white dwarfs could potentially explain these pulsars' origins. It may therefore be a member of a small but growing class of globular cluster pulsars that appear to be significantly younger than their host clusters.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR broadband X-ray observation of EF Eri following its reawakening into a high accretion state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first $\textit{NuSTAR}$ X-ray observation of EF Eri, a well-known polar system. The $\textit{NuSTAR}$ observation was conducted in conjunction with $\textit{NICER}$, shortly after EF Eri entered a high accretion state following an unprecedented period of low activity lasting 26 years since 1997. $\textit{NuSTAR}$ detected hard X-ray emission up to 50 keV with an X-ray flux of $1.2\times10^{-10}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($3\rm{-}50 keV$). Folded X-ray lightcurves exhibit a single peak with $\sim65\%$ spin modulation throughout the $3\rm{-}50$ keV band. We found no evidence of QPO signals at $\nu = 0.1\rm{-}100$ Hz with an upper limit on the QPO amplitude below $5\%$ ($90\%$ CL) at $\nu \sim 0.5$ Hz where the optical QPO was previously detected. Our 1-D accretion column model, called ${\tt MCVSPEC}$, was fitted to the $\textit{NuSTAR}$ spectral data, yielding an accurate WD mass measurement of $M = (0.55\rm{-}0.58) M_\odot$. $\texttt{MCVSPEC}$ accounts for radiative cooling by thermal bremsstrahlung and cyclotron emission, X-ray reflection off the WD surface, and a previously constrained range of the accretion column area. The derived WD mass range is in excellent agreement with the previous measurement of $M = (0.55\rm{-}0.60) M_\odot$ in the optical band. This demonstrates a combination of broadband X-ray spectral analysis and the ${\tt MCVSPEC}$ model that can be employed in our ongoing $\textit{NuSTAR}$ observation campaign of other polars to determine their WD masses accurately.</description>

      <title>X-ray properties of coronal emission in radio quiet Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powerful sources of panchromatic radiation. All AGN emit in X-rays, contributing around $\sim 5-10\%$ of the AGN bolometric luminosity. The X-ray emitting region, popularly known as the corona, is geometrically and radiatively compact with a size typically $\lesssim 10 \, R_{\rm G}$ (gravitational radii). The rapid and extreme variability in X-rays also suggest that the corona must be a dynamic structure. Decades of X-ray studies have shed much light on the topic, but the nature and origin of AGN corona are still not clearly understood. This is mostly due to the complexities involved in several physical processes at play in the high-gravity, high-density and high-temperature region in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). It is still not clear how exactly the corona is energetically and physically sustained near a SMBH. Since corona is ubiquitously found in AGN, is there something fundamental about the accretion process that produces it? In this review we discuss the X-ray observational properties of the corona in radio quiet AGN.</description>

      <title>PSR J1631-4722: The Discovery of a Young and Energetic Pulsar in the Supernova Remnant G336.7+0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting a pulsar associated with a supernova remnant (SNR) and/or pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is crucial for unraveling its formation history and pulsar wind dynamics, yet the association with a radio pulsar is observed only in a small fraction of known SNRs and PWNe. In this paper, we report the discovery of a young pulsar J1631$-$4722, associated with the Galactic SNR G336.7$+$0.5 using Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. It is also potentially associated with a PWN revealed by the Rapid ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder) Continuum Survey (RACS). This 118 ms pulsar has a high dispersion measure of 873 $\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$ and a rotation measure of $-$1004 $\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$. Because of such a high DM, at frequencies below 2 GHz, the pulse profile is significantly scattered, making it effectively undetectable in previous pulsar surveys at $\sim$1.4 GHz. Follow-up observations yield a period derivative of $\dot{P} = 3.6 \times 10^{-15}$, implying a characteristic age, $\tau_{c} = 33\,$kyr, and spin-down luminosity, $\dot{E} = 1.3\times10^{36}\,$erg$\,s^{-1}$. PSR$\,$J1631$-$4722, with its high spin-down luminosity and potential link to a PWN, stands out as a promising source of the high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission observed in the region.</description>

      <title>FRB 20230708A, a quasi-periodic FRB with unique temporal-polarimetric morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a rapid increase in the known fast radio burst (FRB) population, yet the progenitor(s) of these events have remained an enigma. A small number of FRBs have displayed some level of quasi-periodicity in their burst profile, which can be used to constrain their plausible progenitors. However, these studies suffer from the lack of polarisation data which can greatly assist in constraining possible FRB progenitors and environments. Here we report on the detection and characterisation of FRB 20230708A by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), a burst which displays a rich temporal and polarimetric morphology. We model the burst time series to test for the presence of periodicity, scattering and scintillation. We find a potential period of T = 7.267 ms within the burst, but with a low statistical significance of 1.77$\sigma$. Additionally, we model the burst's time- and frequency-dependent polarisation to search for the presence of (relativistic and non-relativistic) propagation effects. We find no evidence to suggest that the high circular polarisation seen in FRB 20230708A is generated by Faraday conversion. The majority of the properties of FRB 20230708A are broadly consistent with a (non-millisecond) magnetar model in which the quasi-periodic morphology results from microstructure in the beamed emission, but other explanations are not excluded.</description>

      <title>Radiative cooling changes the dynamics of magnetically arrested disks: Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied magnetically arrested disks (MAD) around rotating black holes (BH), under the influence of radiative cooling. We introduce a critical value of the mass accretion rate $\dot M_{\rm crit}$ for which the cooling by the synchrotron process efficiently radiates the thermal energy of the disk. We find $\dot M_{\rm crit} \approx 10^{-5.5} \dot M_{\rm Edd}$, where $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington mass accretion rate. The normalization constant depends on the saturated magnetic flux and on the ratio of electron to proton temperatures, but not on the BH mass. We verify our analytical estimate using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations for a range of black hole spin parameters $a \in \{ -0.94, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.94 \}$ and mass accretion rates ranging from $10^{-7}\dot M_{\rm Edd}$ to $10^{-4}\dot M_{\rm Edd}$. We numerically observe that the MAD parameter and the jet efficiency vary by a factor of $\approx 2$ as the mass accretion rate increases above $\dot M_{\rm crit}$, which confirms our analytical result. We further detail how the forces satisfying the quasi-equilibrium of the disk change, with the magnetic contribution increasing as the thermal contribution decreases.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Observations of the Black Hole X-ray Binary MAXI J1820$+$070 in the Rebrightening Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of quasi-simultaneous multiwavelength (near-infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray) observations of the Galactic X-ray black hole binary MAXI J1820+070 performed in 2019 May 10-13, $\sim 60$ days after the onset of the first rebrightening phase. It showed a much larger optical-to-X-ray luminosity ratio ($\sim 8$) than in the initial outburst epoch. The primary components of the spectral energy distribution (SED) can be best interpreted by radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) spectrum showing a luminosity peak in the optical band. By comparison with theoretical calculations, we estimate the mass accretion rate to be $\dot{M}/(8 L_{\rm Edd}/c^2) \sim 10^{-3}$, where $c$ is the light speed and $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity. In addition to the RIAF emission, a blue power-law component is detected in the optical-UV SED, which is most likely synchrotron radiation from the jet. The optical spectrum taken at the Seimei telescope shows a weak and narrow H$\alpha$ emission line, whose emitting region is constrained to be $\gtrsim 2 \times 10^{4}$ times the gravitational radius. We suggest that the entire disk structure cannot be described by a single RIAF solution but cooler material responsible for the H$\alpha$ emission must exist at the outermost region.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Accretion Disk Structure of the Black Hole X-ray Binary MAXI J1820$+$070 during the Rebrightening Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the evolution of global accretion disk structure in the ``rebrightening'' phase of MAXI J1820$+$070, we perform a comprehensive analysis of its near infrared/optical/UV to X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) utilizing data obtained by OISTER, Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO), Swift, NICER, and NuSTAR in 2019. Optical spectra observed with Seimei telescope in 2019 and 2020 are also analyzed. On the basis of the optical and X-ray light curves and their flux ratios, we divide the whole phase into 3 periods, Periods I (flux rise), II (decay), and III (dim). In the first 2 periods, the source stayed in the low/hard state (LHS), where the X-ray (0.3--30 keV) and optical/UV SED can be both fitted with power-law models. We interpret that the X-ray emission arises from hot corona via Comptonization, whereas the optical/UV flux is dominated by synchrotron radiation from the jets, with a partial contribution from the irradiated disk. The optical/UV power-law component smoothly connects to a simultaneous radio flux, supporting its jet origin. Balmer line profiles in the optical spectra indicate that the inner radius of an irradiated disk slightly decreased from $\sim 2\times 10^5 r_{\rm g}$ (Period I) to $\sim 1\times 10^5 r_{\rm g}$ (Period II), where $r_{\rm g}$ is the gravitational radius, implying a change of the hot corona geometry. In Period III, the SED can be reproduced by an advection-dominated accretion flow and jet emission. However, the double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission line indicates that a cool disk remained at large radii.</description>

      <title>Observation of a spectral hardening in cosmic ray boron spectrum with the DAMPE space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary cosmic ray fluxes are important probes of the propagation and interaction of high-energy particles in the Galaxy. Recent measurements of primary and secondary cosmic ray nuclei have revealed unexpected spectral features that demand a deeper understanding. In this work we report the direct measurement of the cosmic ray boron spectrum from 10 TeV/n to 8 TeV/n with eight years of data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) mission. The measured spectrum shows an evident hardening at $182\pm24$ GeV/n with a spectral power index of $\gamma_1 = 3.02 \pm 0.01$ before the break and an index change of $\Delta \gamma = 0.31 \pm 0.05$ after the break. A simple power law model is disfavored at a confidence level of 8$\sigma$. Compared with the hardenings measured in the DAMPE proton and helium spectra, the secondary boron spectrum hardens roughly twice as much as these primaries, which is consistent with a propagation related mechanism to interpret the spectral hardenings of cosmic rays observed at hundreds of GeV/n.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Origins of GRB X-ray Plateaus through a Study of X-ray Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) display complex features, including plateaus and flares, that challenge theoretical models. Here, we study the properties of flares that are observed in the early afterglow phase (up to a few thousand of seconds). We split the sample into two groups: bursts with and without X-ray plateau. We find that the distributions of flare properties are similar in each group. Specifically, the peak time ($t_{\rm pk}$) of the flares and the ratio of the flare width to the flare peak time ($w/t_{\rm pk}$) which is found to be $\approx 1$, regardless of the presence of a plateau. We discuss these results in view of the different theoretical models aimed at explaining the origin of the plateau. These results are difficult to explain by viewing angle effects or late-time energy injection, but do not contradict the idea that GRBs with X-ray plateau have low Lorentz factor, of the order of tens. For these GRBs, the dissipation processes that produce the flares naturally occur at smaller radii compared to GRBs with higher Lorentz factors, while the flares maintain a similar behaviour. Our results therefore provide an independent support for the idea that many GRBs have a Lorentz factor of a few tens rather than a few hundreds.</description>

      <title>A systematic search for redback and black widow candidates based on the 4FGL-DR3 unassociated sources and the Zwicky Transient Facility data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spider pulsars constitute a distinct subset within the domain of radio millisecond pulsars, divided further into the categories of black widows and redbacks. Evident across multiple wavelengths, these pulsars manifest periodic variations and reside within binary systems. Investigating and discovering additional spider-type pulsars carries significant implications for comprehending the evolution of high-mass stars. Particularly crucial is the validation of the "Recycling" theory of millisecond pulsar genesis. In this investigation, we systematically explore spider pulsar binary systems utilizing time-domain variability data from the Zwicky Transient Facility, in conjunction with Fermi unassociated gamma-ray sources sourced from the 4FGL-DR3 catalog. We have implemented a time-domain data processing pipeline utilizing the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram algorithm, integrated with the wget data crawling technology. This approach has led to the identification of 194 ellipsoidal variables and irradiation-type binary stars. Subsequent refinement through the Gaia Hertzsprung-Russell diagram has culled a selection of 24 spider pulsar gold sample candidates. By incorporating the 4FGL 95\% confidence error ellipse, the pool was narrowed down to 19 gold sample candidates. Utilizing the Gaia color-reduced proper motion diagram further refined the selection to 9 gold sample candidates. These newly identified spider pulsar candidates will inform subsequent observational campaigns across radio, X-ray, and optical spectroscopy, thereby facilitating a deeper validation of their physical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the Sombrero Galaxy as an Accelerator of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are the highest energy messenger from space, with energies exceeding 1 EeV. Although UHECRs were discovered over 60 years ago, their origin still remains a mystery. Pinpointing sources of UHECRs is crucial for understanding the extreme astrophysical processes that accelerate particles to such extraordinary energies. We searched for UHECR multiplets via analyzing 17 years of data with energies greater than 40 EeV from the Pierre Auger Observatory. A spatial association is found between a multiplet of $25.7^{+6.2}_{-7.0}$ cosmic rays and the Sombrero galaxy with a local (global) significance of $4.5~\sigma~(3.3~\sigma)$. The Sombrero galaxy hosts a supermassive central black hole with a mass of $\sim1\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$ and exhibits large-scale radio lobes and jets. Our finding provides critical evidence on active supermassive black holes as the source of the highest-energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Non-Radial Oscillation Modes in Hybrid Stars with Hyperons and Delta Baryons: Full General Relativity Formalism vs. Cowling Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of hyperons, delta baryons, and quark matter phase transitions on f-mode oscillations in neutron stars. Using the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase, we construct hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) consistent with astrophysical constraints. Including hyperons and delta baryons soften the EoS, reducing maximum masse, while phase transition to the quark matter further softens the EoS, decreasing the speed of sound and hence the maximum mass. f-mode frequencies, calculated using both the Cowling approximation and the general relativistic (GR) frameworks, reveal a significant overestimation by the Cowling method of about 10-30%, with discrepancies decreasing for more massive stars. We derive universal relations connecting the frequencies of the f-mode to the average density, compactness, and tidal deformability, finding significant deviations due to hyperons and delta baryons. Empirical relations for mass-scaled and radius-scaled frequencies are also provided, highlighting the importance of GR calculations for accurate modeling. These findings highlight the potential of gravitational wave asteroseismology to constrain neutron star EoSs and internal structure.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the spin-kick alignment of pulsars from the statistics of their magnetic inclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated neutron stars are thought to receive a natal kick velocity at birth nearly aligned with their spin axis. Direct observational confirmation of this alignment has been limited to a single source in a supernova remnant (PSR J0538+2817) whose three-dimensional velocity has been well-constrained. Pulsar polarisation statistical properties indicate the presence of a spin-kick correlation, but aligned and orthogonal cases remain plausible. However, if the three-dimensional velocities of radiopulsars are indeed predominantly aligned with their spin axes, a systematic difference in the observed transverse velocities of pulsars with small and large magnetic obliquities would be expected. In particular, due to projection effects, weakly oblique rotators should show systematically smaller and less scattered transverse velocities. In contrast, transverse velocities of pulsars with large obliquities should be close to their actual three-dimensional velocities. This study analyzed samples of 13 weakly and 25 strongly oblique pulsars with known distances and proper motions. We find their peculiar velocities being distributed differently with the statistical confidence of 0.007 and 0.016 according to Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, respectively. We performed a detailed population synthesis of the isolated pulsars, considering the evolution of their viewing geometry in both isotropic and spin-aligned kick scenarios. The observed split in the transverse velocity distributions and its amplitude are consistent with the spin-aligned kick model but not the isotropic case. At the same time, an orthogonal kick predicts a similar effect but of the opposite sign. This provides robust support for pulsar spin-kick alignment based on their statistics and independent of their polarization properties.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Merger Rates in AGN: contribution from gas-captu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that merging black hole (BH) binaries in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs formed through two-body scatterings via the gas-capture process may explain a significant fraction of BH mergers in AGN and a non-negligible contribution to the observed rate from LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of BH and binary BH formation, evolution and mergers across the observed AGN mass function using a novel physically motivated treatment for the gas-capture process derived from hydrodynamical simulations of BH-BH encounters in AGN and varying assumptions on the AGN disc physics. The results suggest that gas-captured binaries could result in merger rates of 0.73 - 7.1Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. Most mergers take place near the outer boundary of the accretion disk, but this may be subject to change when migration is considered. The BH merger rate in the AGN channel in the Universe is dominated by AGN with supermassive BH masses on the order of 10$^{7} M_\odot$ , with 90% of mergers occurring in the range 10$^{6} M_\odot$ - 10$^{8} M_\odot$ . The merging mass distribution is flatter than the initial BH mass power law by a factor $\Delta \xi$ = 1.1 to 1.2, as larger BHs can align with the disc and successfully form binaries more efficiently. Similarly, the merging mass ratio distribution is flatter, therefore the AGN channel could easily explain the high mass and unequal mass ratio detections such as GW190521 and GW190814. When modelling the BH binary formation process using a simpler dynamical friction treatment, we observe very similar results, where the primary bottleneck is the alignment time with the disk. We find the most influential parameters on the rates are the anticipated number of BHs and their mass function. We conclude that AGN remain an important channel for consideration, particularly for gravitational wave detections involving one or two high mass BHs.</description>

      <title>Towards an exact approach to pulsar timing</title>

Abstract: The pulsar timing technique, which compares the observed arrival times of electromagnetic radiation from a pulsar with the predicted arrival times derived from a theoretical model of the pulsar system, is used in pulsar astronomy to infer a multitude of physical information and to constrain possible corrections to General Relativity (GR). The propagation delay is usually computed using formulas based on a post-Newtonian approach, for both the light trajectory and the orbital motion. However, evidence has recently emerged that this approximation may no longer be sufficient when the companion object is a supermassive black hole; deviations from a full GR computation of the propagation delay can reach a few seconds. In this paper, we analyze the case of binary pulsars with a stellar or intermediate black hole companion, whose discovery and timing are key goals of SKA. With a numerical algorithm, we have found that in this case, the full GR value depends only on the semi-major axis of the relative orbit and on the mass of the black hole companion. If the mass of the latter is sufficiently large ($100 M_{\odot}$), the maximum difference between the two approaches is significant ($\sim10^{-7}$ s) even for large binaries ($\sim10^{16}$ cm), and increases up to $\sim 10^{-4}$ s when the mass is $10^5 M_{\odot}$. We also consider relativistic corrections to the orbital motion, and discover that they can strongly affect the value of the propagation delay. We conclude that in the future, post-Newtonian formulas should be replaced with a more accurate approach in these systems, especially in view of future discoveries made by new large telescopes such as SKA.</description>

      <title>Is your stochastic signal really detectable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separating a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from noise is a challenging statistical task. One approach to establishing a detection criterion for the SGWB is using Bayesian evidence. If the evidence ratio (Bayes factor) between models with and without the signal exceeds a certain threshold, the signal is considered detected. We present a formalism to compute the averaged Bayes factor, incorporating instrumental-noise and SGWB uncertainties. As an example, we consider the case of power-law-shaped SGWB in LISA and generate the corresponding \textit{bayesian sensitivity curve}. Unlike existing methods in the literature, which typically neglect uncertainties in both the signal and noise, our approach provides a reliable and realistic alternative. This flexible framework opens avenues for more robust stochastic gravitational wave background detection across gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

Abstract: We describe some of our group's recent work on common envelopes. Our goal is to understand the onset and outcomes of dynamically unstable mass transfer, including the properties of the binaries left behind and the outflows during the common envelope stage. We have also started thinking about light curves of common envelope events. During a talk at StanFest, a meeting in honour of Stan Owocki's retirement held in Leuven in July, 2024, the first author reported on some of the results we recently obtained and briefly outlined future prospects.</description>

      <title>The symbiotic star V694 Mon has transitioned from the accreting-only state to the steady burning phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the drastic photometric and spectroscopic changes affecting the symbiotic star V694 Mon since 2018, are due to its transition from the accreting-only state to steady hydrogen-burning on the surface of the white dwarf, closely mimicking the pattern followed by V4368 Sgr. The phase of peak optical brightness and weakest emission lines has probably been reached in early 2024. The high-velocity absorptions powered by jet-ejection and the wild flickering, which dominated the century-long quiescence, should not reappear as long has nuclear burning will hold (time-scale of decades). The 3500 Lsun burning luminosity suggests a mass of 0.60 Msun for the WD.</description>

      <title>Spin effects in the phasing formula of eccentric compact binary inspirals till the third post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binary sources that emit gravitational waves (GW) are expected to be both spinning and have eccentric orbits. To date, there has been no closed-form expression for the phasing of GWs that contain information from both spin and eccentricity. The introduction of eccentricity can slow waveform generation, as obtaining closed-form expressions for the waveform phase is unattainable due to the complexity of the differential equations involved, often requiring slower numerical methods. However, closed-form expressions for the waveform phase can be obtained when eccentricity is treated as a small parameter, enabling quick waveform generation. In this paper, closed-form expressions for the GW phasing in the form of Taylor approximants up to the eighth power in initial eccentricity $(e_0)$ are obtained while also including aligned spins up to the third post-Newtonian order. The phasing is obtained in both time and frequency domains. The TaylorT2 phasing is also resummed for usage in scenarios where initial eccentricities are as high as 0.5. Finally, a waveform is constructed using the $e_{0}^2$ expanded TaylorF2 phasing for aligned-spin systems added to TaylorF2Ecc. We perform mismatch computation between this model and TaylorF2Ecc. The findings indicate that for eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.15$ (defined at 10 Hz) and small spins $(\sim 0.2 )$, the mismatches can be higher than 1%. This leads to an overall loss in signal-to-noise ratio and lower detection efficiency of GWs coming from eccentric spinning compact binary inspirals if the combined effects of eccentricity and aligned spins are neglected in the waveforms.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Radio Emission from the $\beta$ Cep star V2187 Cyg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the radio emission from the $\beta$ Cep star V2187 Cyg using archive data from the Jansky Very Large Array. The observations were made in ten epochs at 1.39 and 4.96 GHz in the highest angular resolution A configuration. We determine a spectral index of of $\alpha = 0.6\pm0.2$ ($S_{\nu} \propto \nu^\alpha$), consistent with an ionized wind or a partially optically-thick synchrotron or gyrosynchrotron source. The emission is spatially unresolved at both frequencies. The 4.96 GHz data shows a radio pulse with a duration of about one month that can be modeled in terms of an internal shock in the stellar wind produced by a sudden increase in the mass-loss rate and the terminal velocity. The quiescent radio emission of V2187 Cyg at 4.96 GHz (with a flux density of $\simeq 150~\mu Jy$), cannot be explained in terms of an internally (by V2187 Cyg) or externally (by a nearby O star) photoionized wind. We conclude that, despite the spectral index suggestive of free-free emission from an ionized wind, the radio emission of V2187 Cyg most likely has a magnetic origin, a possibility that can be tested with a sensitive search for circular polarization in the radio, as expected from gyro-synchrotron radiation, and also by trying to measure the stellar magnetic field, that is expected to be in the range of several kGauss.</description>

      <title>Early-time millimeter observations of the nearby Type II SN 2024ggi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The short-lived ionized emission lines in early spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova SN 2024ggi signify the presence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to its progenitor star. We proposed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations by its Director's Discretionary Time program to catch the potential synchrotron radiation associated with the ejecta-CSM interaction. Multi-epoch observations were conducted using ALMA band 6 at +8, +13, and +17 days after the discovery. The data show non-detections at the position of SN 2024ggi with a 3sigma upper limit of less than 0.15 mJy, corresponding to a luminosity of approximately 8*10^24 erg/s/Hz. In this paper, we leverage the non-detections to place constraints on the properties of CSM surrounding SN 2024ggi. We investigate both the Wind and Eruptive models for the radial distribution of CSM, assuming a constant mass-loss rate in the Wind model and a distance-variant mass-loss rate in the Eruptive model. The derived CSM distribution for the Wind model does not align with the early-time spectral features, while the ALMA observations suggest a mass-loss rate of ~ 5*10^-3 Msun/year for the Eruptive model. Conducting multi-epoch millimeter/submillimeter observations shortly after the explosion, with a cadence of a few days, could offer a promising opportunity to capture the observable signature of the Eruptive model.</description>

      <title>On the proton precipitation sites in solar flares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectrocopy Imager (RHESSI) $\gamma$-ray observations of the extraordinary GOES X25 flare SOL2003-10-28T11:10 are revisited to investigate previously reported conclusions that flare-accelerated electrons and protons precipitate along spatially separated flare loops. In contrast to previous works which reconstructed 2.223 MeV images over extended time periods ($\sim$20 minutes), we selected shorter integration times of the order of 2 to 3 minutes. Using simulations of the 2.223 MeV profile by Murphy et al. (2003) in combination with observations of the prompt $\gamma$-ray lines from the INTEGRAL mission, we obtain two separated integration time ranges representing the peak of the flare and the start of the decay, respectively. The resulting $\gamma$-ray images are then compared to GONG white-light (WL) observations to identify where along the flaring ribbons electrons and protons precipitation occurs. We point out that previously reported results comparing RHESSI hard X-ray (HXR) and $\gamma$-ray images only hold if the relative time evolution in the two energy ranges is the same. As the decay times for the 28 October 2003 is different at the considered two energy ranges (200-300 keV and around 2.223 MeV), the previously published conclusion that electrons and protons precipitate at different locations is an overstatement. Using shorter integration times reveals that the $\gamma$-ray and HXR sources spatially coincide with the WL flare ribbons. Our key conclusion is that electron and proton precipitation sites coincide with the flare ribbons, suggesting that the electron and proton precipitation sites are the same, at least within RHESSI's imaging capabilities. This result solves the twenty-years-long mystery around the previously reported different electron and proton precipitation sites.</description>

Abstract: Parameter estimation of gravitational wave data is often computationally expensive, requiring simplifying assumptions such as circularisation of binary orbits. Although, if included, the sub-dominant effects like orbital eccentricity may provide crucial insights into the formation channels of compact binary mergers. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline strategy leveraging minimally modelled waveform reconstruction to identify the presence of eccentricity in real time. Using injected signals, we demonstrate that ignoring eccentricity ($e_{\rm 20Hz} \gtrsim 0.1$) leads to significant biases in parameter recovery, including chirp mass estimates falling outside the 90% credible interval. Waveform reconstruction shows inconsistencies increase with eccentricity, and this behaviour is consistent for different mass ratios. Our method enables low-latency inferences of binary properties supporting targeted follow-up analyses and can be applied to identify any physical effect of measurable strength.</description>

      <title>Classification uncertainty for transient gravitational-wave noise artefacts with optimised conformal prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in scientific research comes the need for reliable uncertainty quantification. When taking a measurement it is not enough to provide the result, we also have to declare how confident we are in the measurement. This is also true when the results are obtained from a ML algorithm, and arguably more so since the internal workings of ML algorithms are often less transparent compared to traditional statistical methods. Additionally, many ML algorithms do not provide uncertainty estimates and auxiliary algorithms must be applied. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a framework to provide such uncertainty quantifications for ML point predictors. In this paper, we explore the use and properties of CP applied in the context of glitch classification in gravitational wave astronomy. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of CP to the Gravity Spy glitch classification algorithm. CP makes use of a score function, a nonconformity measure, to convert an algorithm's heuristic notion of uncertainty to a rigorous uncertainty. We use the application on Gravity Spy to explore the performance of different nonconformity measures and optimise them for our application. Our results show that the optimal nonconformity measure depends on the specific application, as well as the metric used to quantify the performance.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the Pulsar Timing Array likelihood: A path towards Fourier Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.</description>

      <title>Probing AGN jet precession with LISA</title>

Abstract: The precession of astrophysical jets produced by active-galactic nuclei is likely related to the dynamics of the accretion disks surrounding the central supermassive black holes (BHs) from which jets are launched. The two main mechanisms that can drive jet precession arise from Lense-Thirring precession and tidal torquing. These can explain direct and indirect observations of precessing jets; however, such explanations often utilize crude approximations of the disk evolution and observing jet precession can be challenging with electromagnetic facilities. Simultaneously, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to measure gravitational waves from the mergers of massive binary BHs with high accuracy and probe their progenitor evolution. In this paper, we connect the LISA detectability of binary BH mergers to the possible jet precession during their progenitor evolution. We make use of a semi-analytic model that self-consistently treats disk-driven BH alignment and binary inspiral and includes the possibility of disk breaking. We find that tidal torquing of the accretion disk provides a wide range of jet precession timescales depending on the binary separation and the spin direction of the BH from which the jet is launched. Efficient disk-driven BH alignment results in shorter timescales of $\sim 1$ yr which are correlated with higher LISA signal-to-noise ratios. Disk breaking results in the longest possible times of $\sim 10^7$ yrs, suggesting a deep interplay between the disk critical obliquity (i.e. where the disk breaks) and jet precession. Studies such as ours will help to reveal the cosmic population of precessing jets that are detectable with gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Probing the Circumstellar Environment of highly luminous type IIn SN ASASSN-14il</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present long-term photometric and spectroscopic studies of Circumstellar Material (CSM)-Ejecta interacting supernova (SN) ASASSN-14il in the galaxy PGC 3093694. The SN reaches a peak $r$-band magnitude of $\sim$ $-20.3 \pm 0.2$ mag rivaling SN 2006tf and SN 2010jl. The multiband and the pseudo-bolometric lightcurve show a plateau lasting $\sim 50$ days. Semi-analytical CSM interaction models can match the high luminosity and decline rates of the lightcurves but fail to faithfully represent the plateau region and the bumps in the lightcurves. The spectral evolution resembles the typical SNe IIn dominated by CSM interaction, showing blue-continuum and narrow Balmer lines. The lines are dominated by electron scattering at early epochs. The signatures of the underlying ejecta are visible as the broad component in the H$\alpha$ profile from as early as day 50, hinting at asymmetry in the CSM. A narrow component is persistent throughout the evolution. The SN shows remarkable photometric and spectroscopic similarity with SN 2015da. However, the different polarization in ASASSN-14il compared to SN 2015da suggests an alternative viewing angle. The late-time blueshift in the H$\alpha$ profiles supports dust formation in the post-shock CSM or ejecta. The mass-loss rate of 2-7 M$_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ suggests a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) progenitor in an eruptive phase for ASASSN-14il.</description>

      <title>Brightening and Fading in the Youngest Galactic Supernova Remnant G1.9+0.3: 13 years of monitoring with the Chandra X-ray Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report results from 13 years of Chandra monitoring of nonthermal X-ray emission from the youngest Galactic supernova remnant G1.9+0.3, the only remnant known to be increasing in brightness. We confirm the spatially-integrated flux increase rate of $(1.2 \pm 0.2)$% yr$^{-1}$ between 1 and 7 keV, but find large spatial variations, from decreases of $-3$% yr$^{-1}$ to increases of 7% yr$^{-1}$, over length scales as small as $10''$ or smaller. We observe relatively little change in spectral slope, though one region shows significant hardening (photon index $\Delta \Gamma \sim 0.4$) as it brightens by 1% yr$^{-1}$. Such rates of change can be accommodated by any of several explanations, including steady evolution of the blast wave, expansion or compression of discrete plasma blobs, strong magnetic turbulence, or variations in magnetic-field aspect angle. Our results do not constrain the mean magnetic-field strength, but a self-consistent picture of the spatially averaged rate of increase can be produced in which the maximum energies of accelerated particles are limited by the remnant age (applying both to electrons and to ions) to about 20 TeV, and the remnant-averaged magnetic field strength is about 30 $\mu$G. The deceleration parameter $m$ (average shock radius varying as $t^m$) is about 0.7, consistent with estimates from overall expansion dynamics, and confirming an explosion date of about 1900 CE. Shock-efficiency factors $\epsilon_e$ and $\epsilon_B$ (fractions of shock energy in relativistic electrons and magnetic field) are 0.003 and 0.0002 in this picture. However, the large range of rates of brightness change indicates that such a global model is oversimplified. Temporal variations of photon index, expected to be small but measurable with longer time baselines, can discriminate among possible models.</description>

      <title>Interaction of an outflow with surrounding gaseous clouds as the origin of the late-time radio flares in TDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Close encounter between a star and a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the tidal disruption of the star, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). Recently, a few TDEs, e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT2018hyz, have shown late-time (hundreds of days after their UV/optical peaks) radio flares with radio luminosities of $10^{38\sim39}$ erg/s. The super-Eddington fallback or accretion in a TDE may generate a mass outflow. Here we investigate a scenario that the late-time radio flares come from the interaction of the outflow with the circum-nuclear gaseous clouds, in addition to the slow-evolving emission component due to the outflow-diffuse medium interaction. We calculate the associated radio temporal and spectral signatures and find that they reproduce well the observations. The outflows have the inferred velocity of 0.2$c\sim0.6$$c$, the total mass of $10^{-3}\sim10^{-1}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and the ejection duration of a month to a year. The distances of the clouds to the SMBH are $0.1\sim1$ pc. This scenario has advantages in explaining the long delay, sharpness of the rise and the multiplicity of the late radio flares. Future observations may build up a much larger sample of late-time radio flares and enable their use as a probe of the TDE physics and the host circumnuclear environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AGN bubbles in cool-core galaxy clusters are believed to facilitate the transport of cosmic ray electrons (CRe) throughout the cluster. Recent radio observations are revealing complex morphologies of cluster diffuse emission, potentially linked to interactions between AGN bursts and the cluster environment. We perform three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers and inject a bi-directional jet at the center of the main cluster. Kinetic, thermal, magnetic and CR energy are included in the jet and we use the two-fluid formalism to model the CR component. We explore a wide range of cluster merger and jet parameters. We discuss the formation of various wide-angle-tail (WAT) and X-shaped sources in the early evolution of the jet and merger. During the last phase of the evolution, we find that the CR material efficiently permeates the central region of the cluster reaching radii of $\sim1$-2 Mpc within $\sim5$-6 Gyr, depending on the merger mass ratio. We find that solenoidal turbulence dominates during the binary merger and explore the possibility for the CR jet material to be re-accelerated by super-Alfv\`enic turbulence and contribute to cluster scale radio emission. We find high volume fractions, $\gtrsim 70$\%, at which the turbulent acceleration time is shorter than the electron cooling time. Finally, we study the merger shock interaction with the CRe material and show that it is unlikely that this material significantly contributes to the radio relic emission associated with the shocks. We suggest that multiple jet outbursts and/or off-center radio galaxies would increase the likelihood of detecting these merger shocks in the radio due to shock re-acceleration.</description>

      <title>Constraining the AGN formation channel for detected black hole binary mergers up to z=1.5 with the Quaia catalogue</title>

Abstract: Statistical analyses based on the spatial correlation between the sky maps of Gravitational Wave (GW) events and the positions of potential host environments are a powerful tool to infer the origin of the black hole binary mergers that have been detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA instruments. In this paper, we tighten our previous constraints on the fraction of detected GW events that may have originated from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We consider 159 mergers detected not later than June 1st, 2024, and the all-sky quasar catalogue Quaia. We increase by a factor of 5.3 and 114 the number of considered GW sources and AGN respectively, also extending our analysis from redshift $0.3$ to $1.5$. This is possible thanks to the uniformity of the AGN catalogue and its high level of completeness, which we estimate as a function of redshift and luminosity. We find at a 95 per cent credibility level that un-obscured AGN with a bolometric luminosity higher than $10^{44.5}{\rm erg\ s}^{-1}$ ($10^{45}{\rm erg\ s}^{-1}$) do not contribute to more than the 21 (11) per cent of the detected GW events.</description>

      <title>Merging White Dwarf Binaries Produce Type Ia Supernovae in Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I find that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with bimodal nebular emission profiles occur almost exclusively in massive ($M_\star \gtrsim 10^{11}~M_\odot$) galaxies with low star-formation rates (SFR~$\lesssim 0.5~M_\odot$/yr). The bimodal profiles are likely produced by two white dwarfs that exploded during a merger or collision, supported by a correlation between the peak-to-peak velocity separation ($v_{\rm sep}$) and the SN Ia peak luminosity ($M_V$) which arises naturally from more massive white dwarf binaries synthesizing more $^{56}$Ni during the explosion. The quiescent hosts are consistent with the long delay times required to form double white dwarf binaries. The distributions of SNe Ia with and without bimodal nebular lines differ in host mass, SFR, and specific SFR with K-S test probabilities of $3.1\%$, $0.03\%$, and $0.02\%$, respectively. Viewing angle effects can fully explain the SNe Ia in quiescent hosts without bimodal emission profiles and the dearth of merger/collision driven SNe Ia in star-forming hosts requires at least two distinct progenitor channels for normal SNe Ia. $30-40\%$ of all SNe Ia originate from mergers or collisions depending on how cleanly host environment distinguishes progenitor scenarios. The bimodal SNe Ia share some characteristics with the underluminous 91bg-like SNe Ia that also prefer older populations, but there is no unambiguous connection between the two classifications. This may suggest separate processes or multiple axes of ejecta (a)symmetry. Existing models for WD mergers and collisions broadly reproduce the $v_{\rm sep} - M_V$ correlation and future analyses may be able to infer the masses/mass-ratios of merging white dwarfs in external galaxies.</description>

      <title>Minimum gas mass accreted by spinning intermediate-mass black holes in stellar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) growing through repeated black hole mergers in stellar clusters statistically asymptotes to zero. Putative observations of IMBHs with dimensionless spin parameter $\chi\gtrsim 0.6$ would require a phase of coherent gas accretion to spin up the black hole. We estimate the amount of gas necessary to produce a given IMBH spin. If the observed IMBH mass and spin are $M\gtrsim 1000~M_\odot$ and $\chi\gtrsim 0.6$, respectively, the IMBH must have coherently accreted at least $\sim 100~M_\odot$ of gas. In this scenario, as long as the spin is not maximal, the IMBH can only accrete at most half of its mass. Our estimates can constrain the relative contribution of accretion and mergers to the growth of IMBHs in dense stellar environments.</description>

      <title>Identification of the optical counterpart of the fast X-ray transient EP240414a</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are extragalactic bursts of X-rays first identified in archival X-ray data, and now routinely discovered by the Einstein Probe in real time, which is continuously surveying the night sky in the soft ($0.5 - 4$ keV) X-ray regime. In this Letter, we report the discovery of the second optical counterpart (AT2024gsa) to an FXT (EP240414a). EP240414a is located at a projected radial separation of 27 kpc from its likely host galaxy at $z = 0.4018 \pm 0.0010$. The optical light curve of AT2024gsa displays three distinct components. The initial decay from our first observation is followed by a re-brightening episode, displaying a rapid rise in luminosity to an absolute magnitude of $M_r \sim -21$ after two rest-frame days. While the early optical luminosity and decline rate is similar to luminous fast blue optical transients, the colour temperature of AT2024gsa is distinctly red and we show that the peak flux is inconsistent with a thermal origin. The third component peaks at $M_i \sim -19$ at $\gtrsim 16$ rest-frame days post-FXT, and is compatible with an emerging supernova. We fit the $riz$-band data with a series of power laws and find that the decaying components are in agreement with gamma-ray burst afterglow models, and that the re-brightening may originate from refreshed shocks. By considering EP240414a in context with all previously reported known-redshift FXT events, we propose that Einstein Probe FXT discoveries may predominantly result from (high-redshift) gamma-ray bursts, and thus appear to be distinct from the previously discovered lower redshift, lower luminosity population of FXTs.</description>

      <title>Limiting Rotation Rate of Neutron Stars from Crust Breaking and Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars are not observed to spin faster than about half their breakup rate. This limiting rotational frequency may be related to the strength of their crusts. As a star spins up from accretion, centrifugal forces stress the crust. We perform finite-element simulations of rotating neutron stars and find that the crust fails at rotation rates about half the breakup rate. Given uncertainties in microphysics, we have not determined the crust configuration after this failure. Instead, we argue that the crust may fail in an asymmetric way and could produce a configuration with a significant ellipticity (fractional difference in moments of inertia). If the ellipticity is large, a rotating star will radiate gravitational waves that may limit further spin up. These stars may be promising sources for LIGO / VIRGO and next generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Overionized plasma in the supernova remnant Sagittarius A East anchored by XRISM observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sagittarius A East is a supernova remnant with a unique surrounding environment, as it is located in the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center, Sagittarius A*. The X-ray emission of the remnant is suspected to show features of overionized plasma, which would require peculiar evolutionary paths. We report on the first observation of Sagittarius A East with X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). Equipped with a combination of high-resolution microcalorimeter spectrometer and large field-of-view CCD imager, we for the first time resolved the Fe XXV K-shell lines into fine structure lines and measured the forbidden-to-resonance intensity ratio to be $1.39\pm0.12$, which strongly suggests the presence of overionized plasma. We obtained a reliable constraint on the ionization temperature just before the transition into the overionization state, to be &gt; 4 keV. The recombination timescale was constrained to be &lt; $8\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ s. The small velocity dispersion of $109\pm6$ km s$^{-1}$ indicates a low Fe ion temperature &lt; 8 keV and a small expansion velocity &lt; 200 km s$^{-1}$. The high initial ionization temperature and small recombination timescale suggest that either rapid cooling of the plasma via adiabatic expansion from dense circumstellar material or intense photoionization by Sagittarius A* in the past may have triggered the overionization.</description>

      <title>Formation Rate of Quasiperiodic Eruptions in Galactic Nuclei Containing Single and Dual Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs) are a novel class of transients recently discovered in a few extragalactic nuclei. It has been suggested that a QPE can be produced by a main-sequence star undergoing repeated partial disruptions by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) immediately after getting captured on a tightly bound orbit through the Hills mechanism. In this Letter, we investigate the period-dependent formation rate of QPEs for this scenario, utilizing scattering experiments and the loss-cone theory. We calculate the QPE formation rates in both a single-SMBH and a dual-SMBH system, motivated by the overrepresentation of postmerger galaxies as QPE hosts. We find that for SMBHs of mass $10^{6}$--$10^{7}M_{\odot}$, most QPEs formed in this scenario have periods longer than $\simeq 100$ days. A single-SMBH system generally produces QPEs at a negligible rate of $10^{-10}$--$10^{-8}\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$ due to inefficient two-body relaxation. Meanwhile, in a dual-SMBH system, the QPE rate is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude, mainly due to a boosted angular momentum evolution under tidal perturbation from the companion SMBH (galaxy). The QPE rate in a postmerger galactic nucleus hosting two equal-mass SMBHs separated by a few parsecs could reach $10^{-6}$--$10^{-5}\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Our results suggest that a nonnegligible fraction ($\simeq 10$--$90\%$) of long-period QPEs should come from postmerger galaxies.</description>

      <title>Hypothetical Lorentz invariance violation and the muon content of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive air showers (EAS), produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere, serve as probes of particle interactions, providing access to energies and kinematical regimes beyond the reach of laboratory experiments. Measurements from multiple cosmic-ray detectors indicate a significant, yet unexplained, discrepancy between the observed muon content in EAS and that predicted by state-of-the-art interaction models, suggesting a need for refinements in our understanding of fundamental physics. Here we show that a tiny, experimentally allowed, violation of the Lorentz invariance (LIV) may result in the suppression of the number of electrons in EAS, leaving the muon number intact and explaining both the ''muon excess'' and its energy dependence. On the other hand, we use the lack of a much stronger discrepancy between EAS data and simulations to obtain strict constraints on the LIV scale. Future experimental tests of this LIV scenario are outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper responds to suggestions that the standard approach to collective neutrino oscillations leaves out potentially important quantum many-body correlations. Arguments in favor of this idea have been based on calculations that, on close scrutiny, offer no evidence either way. Inadequacies of the usual quantum-kinetic formalism are not currently supported by the literature.</description>

      <title>Mass octupole and current quadrupole corrections to gravitational wave emission from close hyperbolic encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the next-to-leading order corrections in the mass multipole expansion, i.e. the mass octupole and current quadrupole, to gravitational wave production by close hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. We find that the signal is again, as in the simple quadrupole case, a burst event with the majority of the released energy occurring during the closest approach. In particular, we investigate the relative contribution to the power, both in the time and frequency domains, and total energy emitted by each order in the mass multipole expansion in gravitational waves. To do so, we include in the quadrupole term its first order post-Newtonian correction, giving this a contribution to the power of the same order as that of the mass octupole and the current quadrupole. We find specific configurations of systems where these corrections could be important and should be taken into account when analysing burst events.</description>

      <title>Transient electromagnetic sources can detect solitary black holes in Milky Way galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way galaxy is estimated to host up to a billion stellar-mass solitary black holes (BHs). The number and distribution of BH masses can provide crucial information about the processes involved in BH formation, the existence of primordial BHs, and the interpretation of gravitational wave (GW) signals detected in LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. {Sahu et al. recently confirmed one solitary stellar-mass BH in our galaxy using astrometric microlensing}. This work proposes a novel mechanism to identify such BH by analyzing the frequency and damping of the quasi-normal modes of GW generated from the interaction of the BH and EM wave originating from a transient electromagnetic (TEM) source. The incoming EM waves distort the curvature of a BH, releasing GWs as it returns to a steady state. Using the covariant semi-tetrad formalism, we quantify the generated GWs via the \emph{Regge-Wheeler tensor} and relate the GW amplitude to the energy of the TEM. We demonstrate that isolated BHs at a distance of 50 pc from Earth can be detected by LIGO A+ and 100 pc by Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope. Additionally, we discuss the observational implications for orphan afterglows associated with GRBs, highlighting the potential for further discoveries.</description>

      <title>Optimal Celestial Bodies for Dark Matter Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of celestial bodies have been considered as dark matter detectors. Which stands the best chance of delivering the discovery of dark matter? Which is the most powerful dark matter detector? We investigate a range of objects, including the Sun, Earth, Jupiter, Brown Dwarfs, White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, Stellar populations, and Exoplanets. We quantify how different objects are optimal dark matter detectors in different regimes by deconstructing some of the in-built assumptions in these search sensitivities, including observation potential and particle model assumptions. We find new constraints and future sensitivities across a range of dark matter annihilation final states. We quantify mediator properties leading to detectable celestial-body energy injection or Standard Model fluxes, and show how different objects can be expected to deliver corroborating signals. We discuss different search strategies, their opportunities and limitations, and the interplay of regimes where different celestial objects are optimal dark matter detectors. Deconstructing the assumptions of these searches leads us to point out a new search using the Galactic center stellar population that can provide greater sensitivity to the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section than the Sun, despite being significantly further away in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Effect of Torsion on Neutron Star Structure in Einstein-Cartan Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein-Cartan gravity is a close historical sibling of general relativity that allows for spacetime torsion. As a result, angular momentum couples to spacetime geometry in a similar way to energy. While consequences of this are well studied on cosmological scales, their role in neutron star physics is largely under-explored. We study the effects that torsion, sourced by either microphysical spin or macroscopic angular momentum, has on neutron stars. For this, we use a simplified polytropic model to quantify the microphysical coupling to torsion. We also derive expressions to model rotation-induced torsion effects and estimate the consequences for rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates. We find that the presence of torsion in general leads to neutron stars with smaller radii and masses, but higher central densities. Realistic models for microphysical spin lead to torsion effects that have no relevant influence on the neutron star structure. Rotation-induced torsion effects however, can decrease the radius by up to $900\,m$, which is comparable to the increase due to centrifugal forces. Depending on which effect dominates, this leads to a torsion-induced spin-up or spin-down of the neutron star. We conclude that torsion effects due to rotation can not be neglected and are large enough to be tested using current or near-future technology.</description>

      <title>A blazar in the epoch of reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets are thought to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of massive galaxies and supermassive black holes. Blazars, which are quasars with jets aligned along our line of sight, provide insights into the jetted population and have been observed up to redshifts of z=6.1. Here, we report the discovery and multi-wavelength characterization of the blazar VLASS J041009.05-013919.88 at z=7 (Universe's age ~750 Myr), powered by a ~7x10^8 Msun black hole. The presence of this high-redshift blazar implies a large population of similar but unaligned jetted sources in the early Universe. Our findings suggest two possible scenarios: in one, the jet in J0410-0139 is intrinsically low-power but appears highly luminous due to relativistic beaming, suggesting that most UV-bright quasars at this redshift host jets. Alternatively, if J0410-0139 represents an intrinsically powerful radio source, there should be hundreds to thousands of radio-quiet quasars at z~7 with properties similar to J0410-0139, a prediction in tension with observed quasar densities based on their UV luminosity function. These results support the hypothesis that rapid black hole growth in the early Universe may be driven by jet-enhanced or obscured super-Eddington accretion, potentially playing a key role in forming massive black holes during the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray north-south anisotropy: rigidity spectrum and solar cycle variations observed by ground-based muon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The north-south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy's spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multi-directional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean-free-path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion-convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean-free-path length into $\le200$ GV rigidity region from $&lt;10$ GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.</description>

      <title>How the HESS J1731-347 event could be explained using $\bf{K^{-}}$ condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of a compact star with a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, located within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, has substantially reinforced the evidence for the presence of exotic matter in neutron stars core. This finding has markedly enhanced our comprehension of the equation of state for dense nuclear matter. In the present work, we investigate the possible existence of a kaon condensation in hadronic neutron stars by employing and comparing two theoretical frameworks: the Relativistic Mean Field model with first order kaon condensate and the Momentum-Dependent Interaction model complemented by chiral effective theory. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the specific object with the inclusion of a kaon condensation in dense nuclear matter. The application of two different models enriches the research, providing insights from the aspect of different theoretical frameworks that accurately predict the existence of HESS J1731-347. In both cases significant insights are extracted for the parameter space of models, emphasizing to those concerning the nucleon-kaon potential, the threshold density for the appearance of a kaon condensation, as well as the parameter $a_{3}m_{s}$ which is related to the strangeness content of the proton. Concluding, the present research indicates that a more systematic investigation of similar objects could offer valuable constraints on the properties of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Robust detection of hot intragroup medium in optically selected, poor galaxy groups by eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last several decades, extensive research has been conducted on the baryon cycles within cosmic structures, encompassing a broad mass range from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. However, a notable gap in understanding the cosmic baryon cycle is the poor galaxy groups with halo masses around $10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$ (e.g., McGaugh et al. 2010). Poor galaxy groups, like our own Local Group, are prevalent throughout the universe, yet robust detection of their hot, X-ray emitting intragroup medium (IGrM) has remained elusive. The presence of this hot IGrM is crucial for addressing the long-standing "missing baryons" problem. Previous ROSAT-based studies were limited by a small number of X-ray bright samples, thus restricting the scope of their findings. Here we show a robust detection of this hot IGrM in a large, optically selected poor groups sample, based on the stacked X-ray images from the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey. These groups are identified in DESI LS with a mass range of log($M_\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) = 11.5-13.5 and a redshift range of z = 0.1-0.5. Additionally, our results indicate that despite its presence in virtually groups at all sizes, this gas component is still not sufficient to recover the universal baryon fraction, and hence the "missing baryons" problem still persists in poor galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>ComPair-2: A Next Generation Medium Energy Gamma-ray Telescope Prototype</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many questions posed in the Astro2020 Decadal survey in both the New Messengers and New Physics and the Cosmic Ecosystems science themes require a gamma-ray mission with capabilities exceeding those of existing (e.g. Fermi, Swift) and planned (e.g. COSI) observatories. ComPair, the Compton Pair telescope, is a prototype of such a next-generation gamma-ray mission. It had its inaugural balloon flight from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico in August 2023. To continue the goals of the ComPair project to develop technologies that will enable a future gamma-ray mission, the next generation of ComPair (ComPair-2) will be upgraded to increase the sensitivity and low-energy transient capabilities of the instrument. These advancements are enabled by AstroPix, a silicon monolithic active pixel sensor, in the tracker and custom dual-gain silicon photomultipliers and front-end electronics in the calorimeter. This effort builds on design work for the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X) concept that was submitted the 2021 MIDEX Announcement of Opportunity. Here we describe the ComPair-2 prototype design and integration and testing plans to advance the readiness level of these novel technologies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of Electron Energy Spectrum Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electron spectrum exhibits a complex structure and has controversially proposed origins. This work reproduce the evolution of the electron spectrum based on a spatially dependent propagation (SDP) model. The key point is that our SPD model features two diffusion regions leading to two diffusion timescales, competing with the cooling timescale. This results in a three-segment power-law electron spectrum: (1) The spectrum below tens of GeV is primarily influenced by cooling effects from distant sources. (2) The spectrum dominated by diffusion effects from nearby sources from tens of GeV to TeV. (3) The spectrum above TeV, which is predominantly governed by cooling effects from nearby sources. This evolution is unique to the SDP model, and we offer a comprehensive and clear depiction of electron evolution under a single propagation scenario for the first time.</description>
