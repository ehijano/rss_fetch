      <title>Interaction between skew-representability, tensor products, extension properties, and rank inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skew-representable matroids form a fundamental class in matroid theory, bridging combinatorics and linear algebra. They play an important role in areas such as coding theory, optimization, and combinatorial geometry, where linear structure is crucial for both theoretical insights and algorithmic applications. Since deciding skew-representability is computationally intractable, much effort has been focused on identifying necessary or sufficient conditions for a matroid to be skew-representable.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to studying skew-representability and structural properties of matroids and polymatroid functions via tensor products. We provide a characterization of skew-representable matroids, as well as of those representable over skew fields of a given prime characteristic, in terms of tensor products. As an algorithmic consequence, we show that deciding skew-representability, or representability over a skew field of fixed prime characteristic, is co-recursively enumerable: that is, certificates of non-skew-representability -- in general or over a fixed prime characteristic -- can be verified. We also prove that every rank-3 matroid admits a tensor product with any uniform matroid and give a construction yielding the unique freest tensor product in this setting. Finally, as an application of the tensor product framework, we give a new proof of Ingleton's inequality and, more importantly, derive the first known linear rank inequality for folded skew-representable matroids that does not follow from the common information property.</description>

      <title>On the forts and related parameters of the hypercube graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2018, forts were defined as non-empty subsets of vertices in a graph where no vertex outside the set has exactly one neighbor in the set. Forts have since been used to characterize zero forcing sets, model zero forcing as an integer program, and provide lower bounds on the zero forcing number. In this article, we give a complete characterization of minimum forts in the hypercube graph, showing that they are automorphic to one of two sets. In contrast, non-automorphic minimum zero forcing sets are identified with distinct propagation times. We also derive the fractional zero forcing number and bounds on the fort number of the hypercube. When the hypercube's dimension is a power of two, the fort number and fractional zero forcing number are equal to the domination number, total domination number, and open packing number. Lastly, we present general constructions for minimal forts in the Cartesian product of graphs, reflecting some minimal forts of the hypercube.</description>

      <title>Maximal sets of a given diameter in Hamming cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of the Hamming cube over $n$-letter alphabet is said to be $d$-maximal if its diameter is $d$, and adding any point increases the diameter. Our main result shows that each $d$-maximal set is either of size at most $(n+o(n))^d$ or contains a non-trivial Hamming ball. The bound of $(n+o(n))^d$ is asymptotically tight. Additionally, we give a non-trivial lower bound on the size of any $d$-maximal set and show that the number of essentially different $d$-maximal sets is finite.</description>

      <title>Covering Complete Geometric Graphs by Monotone Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $A$ of $n$ points (vertices) in general position in the plane, the \emph{complete geometric graph} $K_n[A]$ consists of all ${n\choose 2}$ segments (edges) between the elements of $A$. It is known that the edge set of every complete geometric graph on $n$ vertices can be partitioned into $O(n^{3/2})$ noncrossing paths (or matchings). We strengthen this result under various additional assumptions on the point set. In particular, we prove that for a set $A$ of $n$ \emph{randomly} selected points, uniformly distributed in $[0,1]^2$, with probability tending to $1$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, the edge set of $K_n[A]$ can be covered by $O(n^{4/3} t(n))$ noncrossing paths (or matchings), where $t(n)$ is any function tending to $\infty$. On the other hand, we construct $n$-element point sets such that covering the edge set of $K_n(A)$ requires a quadratic number of monotone paths.</description>

      <title>Characterization of matchable sets and subspaces via Dyson transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matching from a finite subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$ to another subset $B$ is a bijection $f : A \to B$ such that $a f(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. The study of matchings began in the 1990s and was motivated by a conjecture of E. K. Wakeford on canonical forms for homogeneous polynomials. The theory was later extended to the linear-algebraic setting of vector subspaces over field extensions, and then to matroids. In this paper, we investigate the existence and structure of matchings in both abelian groups and field extensions. Using Dyson's $e$-transform, a tool from additive combinatorics, along with a linear analogue which is introduced in this paper, we establish characterization theorems for matchable sets and subspaces. Several applications are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these theorems as standalone tools. Throughout, we highlight the parallels between the group-theoretic and linear-algebraic perspectives.</description>

      <title>Convolutive sequences, I: Through the lens of integer partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the convolutive behavior of the counting function for partitions with designated summands in which all parts are odd, we consider coefficient sequences $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ of primitive eta-products that satisfy the generic convolutive property
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n\ge 0} a_{mn} q^n = \left(\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n q^n\right)^m
  \end{align*}
  for a specific positive integer $m$. Given the results of an exhaustive search of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for $m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly paid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective proofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we apply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also give two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other convolutive series that are not eta-products.</description>

      <title>A characterization of the Carath\'eodory number for $H$-convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Carath\'eodory number for $H$-convexity is the maximum of two parameters: the Helly number for $H$-convexity and the cone number of $H$. The cone number in this article is defined as the maximal number of points of $H$ in conical position with an empty positive hull relative to the remaining points. Earlier partial results by Boltyanski and Martini can provide an exact value for the Carath\'eodory number only when the Helly number is $1$ or $2$.
  We further establish connections between the Carath\'eodory numbers for $H$-convexity and that for $K$-strong convexity, where $H$ is the set of normals of $K$. Specifically, the Carath\'eodory number for $H$-convexity provides a lower bound for that of $K$-strong convexity. Moreover, if $K$ is a polytope, which has $|H|$ facets, then the Carath\'eodory number for $K$-strong convexity is at most the maximum of $|H|-1$ and the Carath\'eodory number for $H$-convexity. We conjecture a characterization of when the bound $|H|-1$ is attained. It is a consequence of a broader conjecture stating that the Carath\'eodory number for $K$-strong convexity is at most the maximum of the Carath\'eodory numbers for $H'$-convexity over all subsets $H'\subseteq H$. Finally, we observe that the Carath\'eodory number is at least the Helly number in any convex-structure where all sets are ordinarily convex.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an type problems for a fixed graph and a linear forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph $G$ is $\mathscr{F}$-free if $G$ does not contain any $F\in \mathscr{F}$ as a subgraph. The Tur\'an number, denoted by $ex(n, \mathscr{F})$, is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $\mathscr{F}$-free graph. Let $F $ be a fixed graph with $ \chi(F) \geq 3 $. A forest $H$ is called a linear forest if all components of $H$ are paths. In this paper, we determined the exact value of $ex(n, \{H, F\}) $ for a fixed graph $F$ with $\chi(F)\geq 3$ and a linear forest $H$ with at least $2$ components and each component with size at least $3$.</description>

      <title>Spanning subgraphs and spectral radius in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spanning tree $T$ of a connected graph $G$ is a subgraph of $G$ that is a tree covers all vertices of $G$. The leaf distance of $T$ is defined as the minimum of distances between any two leaves of $T$. A fractional matching of a graph $G$ is a function $h$ assigning every edge a real number in $[0,1]$ so that $\sum\limits_{e\in E_G(v)}{h(e)}\leq1$ for any $v\in V(G)$, where $E_G(v)$ denotes the set of edges incident with $v$ in $G$. A fractional matching of $G$ is called a fractional perfect matching if $\sum\limits_{e\in E_G(v)}{h(e)}=1$ for any $v\in V(G)$. A graph $G$ with at least $2k+2$ vertices is said to be fractional $k$-extendable if every $k$-matching $M$ in $G$ is included in a fractional perfect matching $h$ of $G$ such that $h(e)=1$ for any $e\in M$. This paper considers a lower bound on the spectral radius of $G$ to guarantee that $G$ has a spanning tree with leaf distance at least $d$. At the same time, we obtain a lower bound on the spectral radius of $G$ to ensure that $G$ is fractional $k$-extendable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected forcing set of a graph is a zero forcing set that induces a connected subgraph. In this paper, we introduce and study CF-dense graphs -- graphs in which every vertex belongs to some minimum connected forcing set. We identify several CF-dense graph families and investigate the relationships between CF-density and analogous notions in zero forcing and total forcing. We also characterize CF-dense trees and give a formula for the number of distinct connected forcing sets in trees. Finally, we analyze when CF-density is preserved under graph operations such as Cartesian products, joins, and coronas.</description>

      <title>Self-reverse labelings of distance magic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is distance magic if it admits a bijective labeling of its vertices by integers from $1$ up to the order of the graph in such a way that the sum of the labels of all the neighbors of a vertex is independent of a given vertex. We introduce the concept of a self-reverse distance magic labeling of a regular graph which allows for a more compact description of the graph and the labeling in terms of the corresponding quotient graph. We show that the members of several known infinite families of tetravalent distance magic graphs admit such labelings. We present a novel general construction producing a new distance magic graph from two existing ones. Using it we show that for each integer $n \geq 6$, except for the odd integers up to $19$, there exists a connected tetravalent graph of order $n$ admitting a self-reverse distance magic labeling. We also determine all connected tetravalent graphs up to order $30$ admitting a self-reverse distance magic labeling. The obtained data suggests a number of natural interesting questions giving several possibilities for future research.</description>

      <title>A remark on the $t$-intersecting Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $t$-intersecting Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem is the following statement: if $\mathcal{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ is a $t$-intersecting family of sets and $n\ge (t+1)(k-t+1)$, then $|\mathcal{F}| \le \binom{n-t}{k-t}$. The first proof of this statement for all $t$ was a linear algebraic argument of Wilson. Earlier, Schrijver had proven the $t$-intersecting Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem for sufficiently large $n$ by a seemingly different linear algebraic argument motivated by Delsarte theory. In this note, we show that the approaches of Schrijver and Wilson are in fact equivalent.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matchings in Random Sparsifications of Dense Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decision problem of perfect matchings in uniform hypergraphs is famously an NP-complete problem. It has been shown by Keevash--Knox--Mycroft [STOC, 2013] that for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, such decision problem restricted to $k$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ satisfying that every $(k-1)$-set of vertices is in at least $(1/k+\varepsilon)|H|$ edges is tractable, and the quantity $1/k$ is best possible. In this paper we study the existence of perfect matchings in the random $p$-sparsification of such $k$-uniform hypergraphs, that is, for $p=p(n)\in [0,1]$, every edge is kept with probability $p$ independent of others. As a consequence, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that with high probability solves the decision problem; we also derive effective bounds on the number of perfect matchings in such hypergraphs. At last, similar results are obtained for the $F$-factor problem in graphs.
  The key ingredients of the proofs are a strengthened partition lemma for the lattice-based absorption method, and the random redistribution method developed recently by Kelly, M\"uyesser and Pokrovskiy, based on the spread method.</description>

      <title>Inversions Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11516v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce inversions tableaux, a new combinatorial model for Schubert polynomials and Stanley symmetric functions that directly specializes to semi-standard Young tableaux in the Grassmannian case. They are a modification of the balanced staircase tableaux of Edelman and Greene. We explicitly describe inversions tableaux that correspond to the lexicographically minimal and maximal monomials in each Schubert polynomial and characterize the unique inversions tableau for dominant permutations. We also characterize the action of generalized chute moves on inversions tableaux, and establish related background that will be used to prove Rubey's chute moves conjecture in upcoming work.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted arithmetic mean. We also provide a characterization for the case when $m=p=2$.</description>

      <title>Metrics on Permutation Families Defined by a Restriction Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the metric structure of permutation families is fundamental to combinatorics and has applications in social choice theory, bioinformatics, and coding theory. We study permutation families defined by restriction graphs--oriented graphs that constrain the relative order of elements in valid permutations. For any restriction graph $G$, we determine the maximum distance achievable by two permutations under the $\ell_\infty$-metric and provide an explicit algorithm that constructs optimal permutation pairs. Our main contribution characterizes when the Kendall-Tau metric achieves its combinatorial upper bound: this occurs if and only if the poset induced by $G$ has dimension at most 2. When this condition holds, the extremal permutations form a minimal realizer of the poset, revealing a deep connection between metric geometry and poset dimension theory. We apply these results to classical permutation statistics including descent sets and Hessenberg varieties, obtaining explicit formulas and efficient algorithms for computing metric diameters.</description>

      <title>A Fast Coloring Oracle for Average Case Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraph $2$-colorability is one of the classical NP-hard problems. Person and Schacht [SODA'09] designed a deterministic algorithm whose expected running time is polynomial over a uniformly chosen $2$-colorable $3$-uniform hypergraph. Lee, Molla, and Nagle recently extended this to $k$-uniform hypergraphs for all $k\geq 3$. Both papers relied heavily on the regularity lemma, hence their analysis was involved and their running time hid tower-type constants.
  Our first result in this paper is a new simple and elementary deterministic $2$-coloring algorithm that reproves the theorems of Person-Schacht and Lee-Molla-Nagle while avoiding the use of the regularity lemma. We also show how to turn our new algorithm into a randomized one with average expected running time of only $O(n)$.
  Our second and main result gives what we consider to be the ultimate evidence of just how easy it is to find a $2$-coloring of an average $2$-colorable hypergraph. We define a coloring oracle to be an algorithm which, given vertex $v$, assigns color red/blue to $v$ while inspecting as few edges as possible, so that the answers to any sequence of queries to the oracle are consistent with a single legal $2$-coloring of the input. Surprisingly, we show that there is a coloring oracle that, on average, can answer every vertex query in time $O(1)$.</description>

      <title>Universal diameter bounds for random graphs with given degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\mathrm{diam}(G)$ be the greatest distance between any two vertices of $G$ which lie in the same connected component, and let $\mathrm{diam}^+(G)$ be the greatest distance between any two vertices of $G$; so $\mathrm{diam}^+(G)=\infty$ if $G$ is not connected.
  Fix a sequence $(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ of positive integers, and let $\mathbf{G}$ be a uniformly random connected simple graph with $V(\mathbf{G})=[n]:=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $\mathrm{deg}_{\mathbf{G}}(v)=d_v$ for all $v \in [n]$. We show that, unless a $1-o(1)$ proportion of vertices have degree $2$, then $\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{diam}(\mathbf{G})]=O(\sqrt{n})$. It is not hard to see that this bound is best possible for general degree sequences (and in particular in the case of trees, in which $\sum_{v=1}^n d_v = 2(n-1)$). We also prove that this bound holds without the connectivity constraint. As a key input to the proofs, we show that graphs with minimum degree $3$ are with high probability connected and have logarithmic diameter: if $\min(d_1,\ldots,d_n) \ge 3$ then $\mathrm{diam}^+(\mathbf{G})=O_{\mathbb{P}}(\log n)$; this bound is also best possible.</description>

      <title>Order-Dependent Dissimilarity Measures on Phylogenetic Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered leaf attachment, Phylo2Vec, and HOP are three recently introduced vector representations for rooted phylogenetic trees where the representation is determined by an ordering of the underlying leaf set X. Comparing the vectors of two rooted phylogenetic X-trees T and T' for a fixed ordering on X leads to polynomial-time computable measure for the dissimilarity of T and T', albeit dependent on the choice of the leaf ordering. For each of ordered leaf attachment, Phylo2Vec, and HOP, we compare this measure with the rooted subtree prune and regraft distance (rSPR), the hybrid number, and the temporal tree-child hybrid number of T and T'. Although there is no direct relationship between rSPR and any of the three vector-based measures, we show that, when minimized over all orderings, the hybrid number is equivalent to HOP, and an upper bound on the other two. Moreover, when minimized over all orderings induced by common cherry-picking sequences of T and T', the temporal tree-child hybrid number of T and T' is equivalent to each of the three vector-based measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss algebraic universality in the sense of P. Vogel for the simplest refined quantity, the Macdonald dimensions. The main known source of universal quantities is given by Chern-Simons theory. Refinement of Chern-Simons theory means introducing additional parameters. At the level of symmetric functions, the refinement is the transition from the Schur functions to the Macdonald polynomials. We consider the Macdonald polynomials associated with the simple Lie algebras, define Macdonald dimensions and dual Macdonald dimensions, and present a universal formula for them that unifies these quantities for algebras associated with simply laced root systems. We also consider mixed Macdonald dimensions that depend on two different root systems.</description>

Abstract: Let $p_1,\dots,p_d$ be integral polynomials vanishing at $0$. It was asked by Bergelson and Hindman whenever $A$ is large, whether the set $\{(m,n)\in \mathbb{N}^2:m+p_1(n),m+p_2(n),\dots,m+p_d(n)\in A\}$ be large in the same sense. In this paper, we give negative answers to this question when ``large'' being the notions of ``central*'', ``IP*'', ``IP$_n$*'', ``IP$_{&lt;\omega}$*'' and ``$\Delta$*''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $(n,R)$-covering sequence is a cyclic sequence whose consecutive $n$-tuples form a code of length $n$ and covering radius $R$. Using several construction methods improvements of the upper bounds on the length of such sequences for $n \leq 20$ and $1 \leq R \leq 3$, are obtained. The definition is generalized in two directions. An $(n,m,R)$-covering sequence code is a set of cyclic sequences of length $m$ whose consecutive $n$-tuples form a code of length~$n$ and covering radius $R$. The definition is also generalized to arrays in which the $m \times n$ sub-matrices form a covering code with covering radius $R$. We prove that asymptotically there are covering sequences that attain the sphere-covering bound up to a constant factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G$ is a set $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that every vertex in $V(G) \setminus S$ has a neighbor in $S$, where two vertices are neighbors if they are adjacent. A secure dominating set of $G$ is a dominating set $S$ of $G$ with the additional property that for every vertex $v \in V(G) \setminus S$, there exists a neighbor $u$ of $v$ in $S$ such that $(S \setminus \{u\}) \cup \{v\}$ is a dominating set of $G$. The secure domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_s(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a secure dominating set of $G$. We prove that if $G$ is a $P_5$-free graph, then $\gamma_s(G) \le \frac{3}{2}\alpha(G)$, where $\alpha(G)$ denotes the independence number of $G$. We further show that if $G$ is a connected $(P_5, H)$-free graph for some $H \in \{ P_3 \cup P_1, K_2 \cup 2K_1, ~\text{paw},~ C_4\}$, then $\gamma_s(G)\le \max\{3,\alpha(G)\}$. We also show that if $G$ is a $(P_3 \cup P_2)$-free graph, then $\gamma_s(G)\le \alpha(G)+1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the well-known conjecture of Ryser which relates maximum matchings to minimum vertex covers in $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraphs, Lov\'asz formulated a stronger conjecture. It states that one can always reduce the matching number by removing $r-1$ vertices. This conjecture was very recently disproven for $r=3$ by Clow, Haxell, and Mohar using the line graph of a $3$-regular graph of order $102$. Building on this, we describe a simple infinite family of counterexamples based on generalized Petersen graphs for the case $r=3$ and give specific counterexamples for $r=4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the theoretical basis developed by Yao and Zeilberger, we consider certain graph families whose structure results in a rational generating function for sequences related to spanning tree enumeration. Said families are Powers of Cycles and Powers of Path; later, we briefly discuss Torus graphs and Grid graphs. In each case we know, a priori, that the set of spanning trees of the family of graphs can be described in terms of a finite-state-machine, and hence there is a finite transfer-matrix that guarantees the generating function is rational. Finding this ``grammar'', and hence the transfer-matrix is very tedious, so a much more efficient approach is to use experimental mathematics. Since computing numerical determinants is so fast, one can use the matrix tree theorem to generate sufficiently many terms, then fit the data to a rational function. The whole procedure can be done rigorously a posteriori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.03255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the process of optimal quantization for several types of discrete probability distributions. Quantization is a technique used to approximate a complex distribution with a smaller set of representative points, which is important in fields such as data compression and signal processing. We begin by examining two specific nonuniform distributions over a finite set of values and identify the best representative points for different levels of approximation. We then extend our analysis to two infinite discrete distributions: one supported on the reciprocals of natural numbers and another on the natural numbers themselves. For these distributions, we compute the optimal sets of representatives and assess how well they approximate the original distributions. Finally, we address the reverse problem-determining the underlying distribution when the optimal sets are known. Our results provide both theoretical insights and computational techniques useful in information theory and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we study conic divisorial ideals of toric rings. We provide an idea to determine them and we give a description of the conic divisorial ideals of Hibi rings and stable set rings of perfect graphs by using this idea. We also characterize when Hibi rings or stable set rings are quasi-symmetric or weakly-symmetric. Moreover, by using the description of the conic divisorial ideals, we construct a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of a special family of stable set rings.</description>

      <title>A Vershik-Kerov theorem for wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G_{n,k}$ be the group of permutations of $\{1,2,\ldots, kn\}$ that permutes the first $k$ symbols arbitrarily, then the next $k$ symbols and so on through the last $k$ symbols. Finally the $n$ blocks of size $k$ are permuted in an arbitrary way. For $\sigma$ chosen uniformly in $G_{n,k}$, let $L_{n,k}$ be the length of the longest increasing subsequence in $\sigma$. For $k,n$ growing, we determine that the limiting mean of $L_{n,k}$ is asymptotic to $4\sqrt{nk}$. This is different from parallel variations of the Vershik-Kerov theorem for colored permutations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15175v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We treat three cubic recurrences, two of which generalize the famous iterated map $x \mapsto x (1-x)$ from discrete chaos theory. A feature of each asymptotic series developed here is a constant, dependent on the initial condition but otherwise intrinsic to the function at hand.</description>

      <title>Normal covering numbers for $S_n$ and $A_n$ and additive combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The normal covering number $\gamma(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the minimum number of proper subgroups whose conjugates cover the group. We give various estimates for $\gamma(S_n)$ and $\gamma(A_n)$ depending on the arithmetic structure of $n$. In particular we determine the limsups over $\gamma(S_n) / n$ and $\gamma(A_n) / n$ over the sequences of even and odd integers, as well as the liminf of $\gamma(S_n) / n$ over even integers. In general we explain how the values of $\gamma(S_n) / n$ and $\gamma(A_n) / n$ are related to problems in additive combinatorics. These results answer most of the questions posed by Bubboloni, Praeger, and Spiga as Problem 20.17 of the Kourovka Notebook.</description>

      <title>Canonical Join Representations and Join-irreducible elements of Garside shadows in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22599v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish some combinatorial properties of elements in Coxeter groups. Firstly, we generalise Reading's theorem on the canonical join representations of elements in finite Coxeter groups to all Coxeter groups. Secondly, we show that for any element $x$ in a Coxeter group $W$ and root $\beta$ in its inversion set $\Phi(x)$, the set of elements $y \in W$ satisfying $\Phi(y) \cap \Phi(x) = \{ \beta \} $ is convex in the weak order and admits a unique minimal representative. This is strongly connected to determining the cone type of the inverse of $x$ and leads to efficient computational methods to determine whether arbitrary elements of $W$ have the same cone type. We also give a characterisation of the join-irreducible elements of two important classes of Garside shadows in Coxeter groups. Finally, we apply our results to explicitly describe the set of ultra-low elements in various families of Coxeter groups, thereby verifying a conjecture of Parkinson and the author for these groups. We give explicit descriptions and counts of the join-irreducible elements of the minimal Garside shadow in these cases.</description>

      <title>Multipacking in Euclidean Metric Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we study the multipacking problems for geometric point sets with respect to their Euclidean distances. We consider a set of $n$ points $P$ and define $N_s[v]$ as the subset of $P$ that includes the $s$ nearest points of $v \in P$ and the point $v$ itself. We assume that the \emph{$s$-th neighbor} of each point is unique, for every $s \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots , n-1\}$. For a natural number $r \leq n-1$, an $r$-multipacking is a set $ M \subseteq P $ such that for each point $ v \in P $ and for every integer $ 1\leq s \leq r $, $|N_s[v]\cap M|\leq (s+1)/2$. The $r$-multipacking number of $ P $ is the maximum cardinality of an $r$-multipacking of $ P $ and is denoted by $ \MP_{r}(P) $. For $r=n-1$, an $r$-multipacking is called a multipacking and $r$-multipacking number is called as multipacking number. For $r=1 \text{ and } 2$, we study the problem of computing a maximum $r$-multipacking of the point sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that a maximum $1$-multipacking can be computed in polynomial time but computing a maximum $2$-multipacking is \textsc{NP-hard}. Further, we provide approximation and parameterized solutions to the $2$-multipacking problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in spherical distance geometry aims to recover an $n$-tuple of points on a 2-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$, viewed up to oriented isometry, from $O(n)$ input measurements. We solve this problem using algorithms that employ only the four arithmetic operations. Each algorithm recursively produces output data that we arrange into a new type of frieze pattern. These frieze patterns exhibit glide symmetry and a version of the Laurent phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Verification of Hamiltonian Path Conjecture (BHR Conjecture) for Integers up to p=31 based on one multiset per FP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a computational approach to verify a specific conjecture concerning Hamiltonian paths in complete graphs with prescribed edge lengths, often referred to as the Buratti $-$ Horak-Rosa Conjecture. Building upon prior computational work by Mariusz Meszka which verified the conjecture for all primes up to 23, our Python program does the BHR conjecture verification for composite and prime numbers up to p=32 in a different way by taking into account one mulltiset per frequency partition (FP). We report successful computational verification for all frequency partitions for integers $p &lt; 32$, specifically presenting results for $p=31$. For the composite number $p = 30$, the Python code took approximately 11 hours to verify on a Lenovo laptop. The method systematically generates frequency partitions of edge lengths and employs a recursive backtracking algorithm to construct the corresponding Hamiltonian paths. The presented program is optimized for efficiency and designed for scalability, allowing for its utilization on more powerful computing resources to explore even higher integer values, thereby providing further evidence for the conjecture's validity.
  The conjecture of Peter Horak and Alex Rosa (generalizing that of Marco Buratti) states that a multiset L of (p-1) positive integers not exceeding $[p/2]$ is the list of edge lengths of a suitable Hamiltonian path of the complete graph with vertex-set of {1, 2, ..., [p-1]} if and only if for every divisor d of p, the number of multiples of d appearing in L is at most [p-d].</description>
