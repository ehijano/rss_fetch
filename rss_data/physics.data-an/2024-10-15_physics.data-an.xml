      <title>Learning from the past: predicting critical transitions with machine learning trained on surrogates of historical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems can undergo critical transitions, where slowly changing environmental conditions trigger a sudden shift to a new, potentially catastrophic state. Early warning signals for these events are crucial for decision-making in fields such as ecology, biology and climate science. Generic early warning signals motivated by dynamical systems theory have had mixed success on real noisy data. More recent studies found that deep learning classifiers trained on synthetic data could improve performance. However, neither of these methods take advantage of historical, system-specific data. Here, we introduce an approach that trains machine learning classifiers directly on surrogate data of past transitions, namely surrogate data-based machine learning (SDML). The approach provides early warning signals in empirical and experimental data from geology, climatology, sociology, and cardiology with higher sensitivity and specificity than two widely used generic early warning signals -- variance and lag-1 autocorrelation. Since the approach is trained directly on surrogates of historical data, it is not bound by the restricting assumption of a local bifurcation like previous methods. This system-specific approach can contribute to improved early warning signals to help humans better prepare for or avoid undesirable critical transitions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Machine Learning Approaches for Classifying Spinodal Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compare the performance of deep learning models for classifying the spinodal dataset. We evaluate state-of-the-art models (MobileViT, NAT, EfficientNet, CNN), alongside several ensemble models (majority voting, AdaBoost). Additionally, we explore the dataset in a transformed color space. Our findings show that NAT and MobileViT outperform other models, achieving the highest metrics-accuracy, AUC, and F1 score on both training and testing data (NAT: 94.65, 0.98, 0.94; MobileViT: 94.20, 0.98, 0.94), surpassing the earlier CNN model (88.44, 0.95, 0.88). We also discuss failure cases for the top performing models.</description>

      <title>TraX Engine: Advanced Processing of Radiation Data Acquired by Timepix Detectors in Space, Medical, Educational and Imaging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TraX Engine is an advanced data processing tool developed by ADVACAM in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), specifically designed for analyzing data from Timepix detectors equipped with various sensor materials (Si, CdTe, GaAs, SiC). TraX Engine can process large datasets across various scientific and medical applications, including space radiation monitoring, particle therapy, and imaging. In space applications, the TraX Engine has been used to process data from satellites like OneWeb JoeySat deployed in LEO orbit, where it continuously monitors space radiation environments measuring flux, dose, and dose rate in real-time. In medical applications, particularly in particle therapy, the TraX Engine is used to process data to characterize radiation fields in terms of particle flux, Linear Energy Transfer, and spatial distribution of the radiation dose. The TraX Engine can identify and classify scattered particles, such as secondary protons and electrons, and estimate their contribution to out-of-field doses. In imaging applications, the TraX Engine is integrated into Compton cameras, where it supports photon source localization through directional reconstruction of photons. The system ability to identify gamma radiation source with high precision makes it suitable for medical imaging tasks, such as tracking I-131 used in thyroid cancer treatment or localizing radiation sources. This paper presents the architecture and capabilities of the newly developed software TraX Engine, alongside results from various applications, demonstrating its role in particle tracking, radiation monitoring, imaging, and others. With its modular architecture, the TraX Engine offers multiple interfaces, including a command-line tool, an API, a web portal, and a graphical user interface, ensuring usability across different fields and user expertise levels.</description>

      <title>Regression Model for Speckled Data with Extremely Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an efficient and widely used remote sensing tool. However, data extracted from SAR images are contaminated with speckle, which precludes the application of techniques based on the assumption of additive and normally distributed noise. One of the most successful approaches to describing such data is the multiplicative model, where intensities can follow a variety of distributions with positive support. The $\mathcal{G}^0_I$ model is among the most successful ones. Although several estimation methods for the $\mathcal{G}^0_I$ parameters have been proposed, there is no work exploring a regression structure for this model. Such a structure could allow us to infer unobserved values from available ones. In this work, we propose a $\mathcal{G}^0_I$ regression model and use it to describe the influence of intensities from other polarimetric channels. We derive some theoretical properties for the new model: Fisher information matrix, residual measures, and influential tools. Maximum likelihood point and interval estimation methods are proposed and evaluated by Monte Carlo experiments. Results from simulated and actual data show that the new model can be helpful for SAR image analysis.</description>

      <title>Characterising high-order interdependence via entropic conjugation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order phenomena play crucial roles in many systems of interest, but their analysis is often highly nontrivial. There is a rich literature providing a number of alternative information-theoretic quantities capturing high-order phenomena, but their interpretation and relationship with each other is not well understood. The lack of principles unifying these quantities obscures the choice of tools for enabling specific type of analyses. Here we show how an entropic conjugation provides a theoretically grounded principle to investigate the space of possible high-order quantities, clarifying the nature of the existent metrics while revealing gaps in the literature. This leads to identify novel notions of symmetry and skew-symmetry as key properties for guaranteeing a balanced account of high-order interdependencies and enabling broadly applicable analyses across physical systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sparse Galaxy Simulations via Out-of-Distribution Detection and Amortized Bayesian Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations are a powerful tool to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and many simulations model key properties of real galaxies. A question that naturally arises for such simulations in light of high-quality observational data is: How close are the models to reality? Due to the high-dimensionality of the problem, many previous studies evaluate galaxy simulations using simplified summary statistics of physical properties. In this work, we combine simulation-based Bayesian model comparison with a novel misspecification detection technique to compare simulated galaxy images of 6 hydrodynamical models observations. Since cosmological simulations are computationally costly, we address the problem of low simulation budgets by first training a $k$-sparse variational autoencoder (VAE) on the abundant dataset of SDSS images. The VAE learns to extract informative latent embeddings and delineates the typical set of real images. To reveal simulation gaps, we then perform out-of-distribution detection (OOD) based on the logits of classifiers trained on the embeddings of simulated images. Finally, we perform amortized Bayesian model comparison using probabilistic classification, identifying the relatively best-performing model along with partial explanations through SHAP values.</description>

      <title>Five-fold precision enhancement in a cold atom experiment via adaptive symmetry-informed Bayesian strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian methods promise enhanced device performance and accelerated data collection. We demonstrate an adaptive Bayesian measurement strategy for atom number estimation in a quantum technology experiment, utilising a symmetry-informed loss function. Compared to a standard unoptimised strategy, our method yields a five-fold reduction in the fractional variance of the atom number estimate. Equivalently, it achieves the target precision with 40% fewer data points. We provide general expressions for the optimal estimator and error for any quantity amenable to symmetry-informed strategies, facilitating the application of these strategies in quantum computing, communication, metrology, and the wider quantum technology sector.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Reconstruction with Information Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing the electric field from the measured voltages in an antenna, unfolding the antenna response, comes with several problems. Due to the noisiness of the signal it is often necessary to disregard part of the bandwidth of the antenna. It is also not guaranteed, that this system of equations can be inverted at all. In any case, the noise of the measurement will be converted into noise on the electric field. This could be solved by Bayesian inference, however, the electric field is continuous, which would lead to an infinite-dimensional latent space. Information field theory (IFT) has been developed to deal with this problem and allow for Bayesian reasoning on fields. It provides a theoretical backbone and effective tools to approach the inference as a discrete problem in the continuum limit, taking the continuous nature of fields into account. We will present a first working signal model that can be used with IFT-based inference algorithms, which can successfully reconstruct the electric field. The model is based on the current understanding of air shower emission physics, modelling geomagnetic and charge-excess emission and their respective polarisation and spectra separately. Since Bayesian inference provides the posterior distribution, this method also gives an estimate on the uncertainty of the measured field. The performance of this method will be demonstrated with Monte-Carlo simulations of air shower radio signals.</description>

      <title>Compression-based inference of network motif sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical and functional constraints on biological networks lead to complex topological patterns across multiple scales in their organization. A particular type of higher-order network feature that has received considerable interest is network motifs, defined as statistically regular subgraphs. These may implement fundamental logical and computational circuits and are referred as "building blocks of complex networks". Their well-defined structures and small sizes also enables the testing of their functions in synthetic and natural biological experiments. The statistical inference of network motifs is however fraught with difficulties, from defining and sampling the right null model to accounting for the large number of possible motifs and their potential correlations in statistical testing. Here we develop a framework for motif mining based on lossless network compression using subgraph contractions. The minimum description length principle allows us to select the most significant set of motifs as well as other prominent network features in terms of their combined compression of the network. The approach inherently accounts for multiple testing and correlations between subgraphs and does not rely on a priori specification of an appropriate null model. This provides an alternative definition of motif significance which guarantees more robust statistical inference. Our approach overcomes the common problems in classic testing-based motif analysis. We apply our methodology to perform comparative connectomics by evaluating the compressibility and the circuit motifs of a range of synaptic-resolution neural connectomes.</description>

      <title>The impact of complexity in the built environment on vehicular routing behavior: Insights from an empirical study of taxi mobility in Beijing, China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modeling of disaggregated vehicular mobility and its associations with the ambient urban built environment is essential for developing operative transport intervention and urban optimization plans. However, established vehicular route choice models failed to fully consider the bounded behavioral rationality and the complex characteristics of the urban built environment affecting drivers' route choice preference. Therefore, the spatio-temporal characteristics of vehicular mobility patterns were not fully explained, which limited the granular implementation of relevant transport interventions. To address this limitation, we proposed a vehicular route choice model that mimics the anchoring effect and the exposure preference while driving. The proposed model enables us to quantitatively examine the impact of the built environment on vehicular routing behavior, which has been largely neglected in previous studies. Results show that the proposed model performs 12% better than the conventional vehicular route choice model based on the shortest path principle. Our empirical analysis of taxi drivers' routing behavior patterns in Beijing, China uncovers that drivers are inclined to choose routes with shorter time duration and with less loss at traversal intersections. Counterintuitively, we also found that drivers heavily rely on circuitous ring roads and expressways to deliver passengers, which are unexpectedly longer than the shortest paths. Moreover, characteristics of the urban built environment including road eccentricity, centrality, average road length, land use diversity, sky visibility, and building coverage can affect drivers' route choice behaviors, accounting for about 5% of the increase in the proposed model's performance. We also refine the above explorations according to the modeling results of trips that differ in departure time, travel distance, and occupation status.</description>

      <title>Uncovering dynamical equations of stochastic decision models using data-driven SINDy algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision formation in perceptual decision-making involves sensory evidence accumulation instantiated by the temporal integration of an internal decision variable towards some decision criterion or threshold, as described by sequential sampling theoretical models. The decision variable can be represented in the form of experimentally observable neural activities. Hence, elucidating the appropriate theoretical model becomes crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying perceptual decision formation. Existing computational methods are limited to either fitting of choice behavioural data or linear model estimation from neural activity data. In this work, we made use of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), a data-driven approach, to elucidate the deterministic linear and nonlinear components of often-used stochastic decision models within reaction time task paradigms. Based on the simulated decision variable activities of the models, SINDy, enhanced with approaches using multiple trials, could readily estimate the dynamical equations, choice accuracy and decision time of the models across a range of signal-to-noise ratio values. In particular, SINDy performed the best using the more memory intensive multi-trial approach while trial-averaging of parameters performed more moderately. The single-trial approach, although expectedly not performing as well, may be useful for real-time modelling. Taken together, our work offers alternative approaches for SINDy to uncover the dynamics in perceptual decision-making, and more generally, for first-passage time problems.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Dynamics and X-ray Burst Characteristics in the Low-Mass X-ray Binary EXO 0748-676</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the timing and spectral characteristics of X-ray bursts from the neutron star system EXO 0748-676 using the NuSTAR observatory's FPMA and FPMB instruments in the 3-79 keV range. We identify Type I X-ray bursts driven by thermonuclear explosions on the neutron star's surface, notably a significant burst at \(X = 18,479.97\), indicating rapid energy release, followed by a recoil burst at \(X = 19,463.97\), reflecting stabilization. The correlation between burst timing and the neutron star's optical period suggests modulation by its rotation and periodic accretion dynamics. Spectral modeling reveals a photon index of \( \Gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.014 \) and a cutoff energy of \( E_C = 36.20 \pm 1.04 \; \text{keV} \), indicating a hot corona around the neutron star. The measured flux of approximately \( (381.17 \pm 0.014) \times 10^{-12} \; \text{erg cm}^{-2} \text{s}^{-1} \) underscores the dynamic nature of accretion-driven systems. Calculated luminosities derived from distance estimates range from \( (3.86 \pm 0.239) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \) to \( (2.3 \pm 0.177) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \). Comparative analysis with prior observations from the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on the INTEGRAL satellite shows variability in emission characteristics, including softer photon indices and higher cutoff energies in 2003 and 2004. Our examination of smaller energy gaps (3-7 keV, 7-12 keV, etc.) reveals energy-dependent behavior in burst characteristics, enhancing our understanding of nuclear burning phases. Overall, these findings validate models describing Type I X-ray bursts and lay the groundwork for future investigations into similar astrophysical systems and stellar evolution processes in extreme environments.</description>
