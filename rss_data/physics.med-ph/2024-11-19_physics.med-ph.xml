      <title>ezyMRI: How to build an MRI machine from scratch -- Experience from a four-day hackathon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance instruments are becoming available to the do-it-yourself community. The challenges encountered in the endeavor to build a magnetic resonance imaging instrument from scratch were confronted in a four-day hackathon at Singapore University of Technology and Design in spring 2024. One day was devoted to educational lectures and three days to system construction and testing. Seventy young researchers from all parts of the world formed six teams focusing on magnet, gradient coil, RF coil, console, system integration, and design, which together produced a working MRI instrument in three days. The different steps, encountered challenges, and their solutions are reported.</description>

      <title>Review on vortex dynamics in the left ventricle as an early diagnosis marker for heart diseases and its treatment outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heart is the central part of the cardiovascular network. Its role is to pump blood to various body organs. Many cardiovascular diseases occur due to an abnormal functioning of the heart. A diseased heart leads to severe complications and in some cases death of an individual. The medical community believes that early diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases can be controlled by referring to numerical simulations of image-based heart models. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a commonly used tool for patient-specific simulations in the cardiac flows, and it can be equipped to allow a better understanding of flow patterns. In this paper, we review the progress of CFD tools to understand the flow patterns in healthy and dilated cardiomyopathic (DCM) left ventricles (LV). The formation of an asymmetric vortex in a healthy LV shows an efficient way of blood transport. The vortex pattern changes before any change in the geometry of LV is noticeable. This flow change can be used as a marker of DCM progression. We can conclude that understanding vortex dynamics in LV using various vortex indexes coupled with data-driven approaches can be used as an early diagnosis tool and improvement in DCM treatment.</description>

      <title>Intra-operative Optimal Flow Diverter Selection for Intracranial aneurysm treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During intracranial aneurysm (IA) treatment with Diverters (FDs), the device/parent artery diameters ratio may influence the ability of the device to induce aneurysm healing response. Oversized FDs are safer to deploy but may not induce enough hemodynamic resistance to ensure aneurysm occlusion. Methods based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) could allow optimal device selection but are time-consuming and inadequate for intra-operative guidance. To address this limitation, we propose to investigate a method for optimal FD selection using Angiographic Parametric Imaging (API) and machine learning (ML). We selected 128 pre-treatment angiographic sequences of IAs which demonstrated full occlusion at six months follow-up. For each IA, we extracted five API parameters from the aneurysm dome and normalized them to the feeding artery corresponding parameters. We dichotomized the dataset based on the FD/ proximal artery diameter ratio as undersized, if the ratio&lt;1 or if multiple FDs were used and oversized otherwise. Single API parameter and ML analysis were used to determine whether API parameters could be used to determine the need for FD under-sizing (i.e., increased flow resistance). Classification accuracy was assessed using area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC). In total we identified 51 and 77 cases for the undersized and oversized cohorts respectively. Single API parameter analysis yielded an inadequate AUROC ~0.5 while machine learning using all five API parameters yielded and AUROC of 0.72.</description>

      <title>In-Silico Analysis of Curve Fitting in Angiographic Parametric Imaging in Intracranial Aneurysms</title>

Abstract: In Angiographic Parametric Imaging (API), accurate estimation of parameters from Time Density Curves (TDC) is crucial. However, these estimations are often marred by errors arising from factors such as patient motion, procedural preferences, image noise, and injection variability. While fitting methods like gamma-variate fitting offer a solution to recover incomplete or corrupted TDC data, they might also introduce unforeseen biases. This study investigates the trade-offs and benefits of employing gamma-variate fitting on virtual angiograms to enhance the precision of API biomarkers. Utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in patient specific 3D geometries, we generated a series of high-definition virtual angiograms at distinct inlet velocities: 0.25m/s, 0.35m/s, and 0.45m/s. These velocities were investigated across injection durations ranging from 0.5s to 2.0s. From these angiograms, TDCs for aneurysms and their corresponding inlets were constructed. To emulate typical clinical challenges, we introduced noise, simulated patient motion, and generated temporally incomplete data sets. These modified TDCs underwent gamma-variate fitting. We quantified both the original and fitted TDC curves using standard angiography metrics such as Cross-Correlation (Cor), Time to Peak (TTP), Mean Transit Time (MTT), Peak Height (PH), Area Under the Curve (AUC), and Maximum Gradient (Max-Gr) for a comprehensive comparison. TDCs enhanced by gamma-variate fitting exhibited a robust correlation with vascular flow dynamics. Our results affirm that gamma-variate fitting can adeptly restore TDCs from fragmentary sequences, elevating the precision of derived API parameters.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Quantitative Angiography using Projection Foreshortening Correction and Injection Bias Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to mitigate these biases and enhance QA analysis by applying a path-length correction (PLC) correction, followed by singular value decomposition (SVD)-based deconvolution, to angiograms obtained through both in-silico and in-vitro methods. We utilized DSA data from in-silico and in-vitro patient-specific intracranial aneurysm models. To remove projection bias, PLC for various views were developed by co-registering the pre-existing 3D vascular geometry mask with the DSA projections, followed by ray tracing to determine paths across 3D vessel structures. These maps were used to normalize the logarithmic angiographic images, correcting for projection-induced foreshortening across different angles. Subsequently, we focused on eliminating injection bias by analyzing the corrected angiograms under varied projection views, injection rates, and flow conditions. Regions of interest at the aneurysm dome and inlet were placed to extract Time Density Curves for the lesion and the arterial input function, respectively. Using three standard SVD methodologies, we extracted the aneurysm Impulse Response function (IRF) and its associated parameters Peak Height (PHIRF), Area Under the Curve (AUCIRF), and Mean Transit Time (MTT). Our methodology employing PLC and SVD-based deconvolution ensures reliable quantitative angiographic measurements across varying conditions, supporting consistent assessments of disease severity and treatment efficacy. This approach significantly enhances intrapatient and intraprocedural reliability in neurovascular diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Imaging neurotransmitter transport in live cells with stimulated Raman scattering microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical neurotransmission is central to neurotypical brain function but also implicated in a variety of psychiatric neurodegenerative diseases. The release dynamics of neurotransmitters is correlated with but distinct from neuronal electrical signal propagation. It is therefore necessary to track neurotransmitter modulation separately from neuron electrical activity. Here, we present a new approach for imaging deuterated neurotransmitter molecules with stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. Using SRS microscopy, we perform direct imaging of deuterated dopamine and GABA in PC12 chromaffin cells, and in primary hippocampal neurons, respectively, based on the carbon-deuterium vibrational frequencies. We demonstrate that SRS imaging of these isotopologues directly visualizes intracellular neurotransmitters without changing the neurotransmitters' chemical identity and requiring custom synthesis or genetic encoding protocols. We further show that stimulation of neurotransmitter release results in an overall 20-50 percent intracellular neurotransmitter signal reduction, in agreement with comparable neurotransmission dynamics studies, with the ability to observe inter- and intracellular variation in vesicular neurotransmitter release. Taken together, our data suggest that neurotransmitter isotopologues can serve as a commercially-available, biocompatible, and generalizable method to image neurotransmitters with deuterated molecules that are virtually chemically identical to their native counterparts.</description>
