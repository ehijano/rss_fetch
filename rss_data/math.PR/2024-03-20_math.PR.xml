      <title>Sharp local propagation of chaos for mean field particles with $W^{-1,\infty}$ kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two methods to obtain $O(1/N^2)$ local propagation of chaos bounds for $N$ diffusive particles in $W^{-1,\infty}$ mean field interaction. This extends the recent finding of Lacker [Probab. Math. Phys., 4(2):377-432, 2023] to the case of singular interactions. The first method is based on a hierarchy of relative entropies and Fisher informations, and applies to the 2D viscous vortex model in the high temperature regime. In the second method, we work on a hierarchy of $L^2$ distances and Dirichlet energies, and derive the desired sharp estimates for the same model in short time without restrictions on the temperature.</description>

      <title>SPDEs on narrow channels and graphs: convergence and large deviations in case of non smooth noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of stochastic partial differential equations of reaction-diffusion type defined on graphs, which can be derived as the limit of SPDEs on narrow planar channels. In the first part, we demonstrate that this limit can be achieved under less restrictive assumptions on the regularity of the noise, compared to [4]. In the second part, we establish the validity of a large deviation principle for the SPDEs on the narrow channels and on the graphs, as the width of the narrow channels and the intensity of the noise are jointly vanishing.</description>

      <title>New Stochastic Fubini Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic stochastic Fubini theorem says that if one stochastically integrates with respect to a semimartingale $S$ an $\eta(dz)$-mixture of $z$-parametrized integrands $\psi^z$, the result is just the $\eta(dz)$-mixture of the individual $z$-parametrized stochastic integrals $\int\psi^z{d}S.$ But if one wants to use such a result for the study of Volterra semimartingales of the form $ X_t =\int_0^t \Psi_{t,s}dS_s, t \geq0,$ the classic assumption that one has a fixed measure $\eta$ is too restrictive; the mixture over the integrands needs to be taken instead with respect to a stochastic kernel on the parameter space. To handle that situation and prove a corresponding new stochastic Fubini theorem, we introduce a new notion of measure-valued stochastic integration with respect to a general multidimensional semimartingale. As an application, we show how this allows to handle a class of quite general stochastic Volterra semimartingales.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation from Single Patient, Single Time-Point Sequencing Data of Recurrent Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we develop consistent estimators for key parameters that govern the dynamics of tumor cell populations when subjected to pharmacological treatments. While these treatments often lead to an initial reduction in the abundance of drug-sensitive cells, a population of drug-resistant cells frequently emerges over time, resulting in cancer recurrence. Samples from recurrent tumors present as an invaluable data source that can offer crucial insights into the ability of cancer cells to adapt and withstand treatment interventions. To effectively utilize the data obtained from recurrent tumors, we derive several large number limit theorems, specifically focusing on the metrics that quantify the clonal diversity of cancer cell populations at the time of cancer recurrence. These theorems then serve as the foundation for constructing our estimators. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that our estimators only require a single time-point sequencing data from a single tumor, thereby enhancing the practicality of our approach and enabling the understanding of cancer recurrence at the individual level.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding walk is ballistic on graphs with more than one end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that on any transitive graph $G$ with infinitely many ends, a self-avoiding walk of length $n$ is ballistic with extremely high probability, in the sense that there exist constants $c,t&gt;0$ such that $\mathbb{P}_n(d_G(w_0,w_n)\geq cn)\geq 1-e^{-tn}$ for every $n\geq 1$. Furthermore, we show that the number of self-avoiding walks of length $n$ grows asymptotically like $\mu_w^n$, in the sense that there exists $C&gt;0$ such that $\mu_w^n\leq c_n\leq C\mu_w^n$ for every $n\geq 1$. Our results extend more generally to quasi-transitive graphs with infinitely many ends, satisfying the additional technical property that there is a quasi-transitive group of automorphisms of $G$ which does not fix an end of $G$.</description>

      <title>Max-stability under first-order stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Max-stability is the property that taking a maximum between two inputs results in a maximum between two outputs. We investigate max-stability with respect to first-order stochastic dominance, the most fundamental notion of stochastic dominance in decision theory. Under two additional standard axioms of monotonicity and lower semicontinuity, we establish a representation theorem for functionals satisfying max-stability, which turns out to be represented by the supremum of a bivariate function. Our characterized functionals encompass special classes of functionals in the literature of risk measures, such as benchmark-loss Value at Risk (VaR) and $\Lambda$-quantile.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Point Estimate Method for Probabilistic Moments Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents in detail the originally developed Quadratic Point Estimate Method (QPEM), aimed at efficiently and accurately computing the first four output moments of probabilistic distributions, using 2n^2+1 sample (or sigma) points, with n, the number of input random variables. The proposed QPEM particularly offers an effective, superior, and practical alternative to existing sampling and quadrature methods for low- and moderately-high-dimensional problems. Detailed theoretical derivations are provided proving that the proposed method can achieve a fifth or higher-order accuracy for symmetric input distributions. Various numerical examples, from simple polynomial functions to nonlinear finite element analyses with random field representations, support the theoretical findings and further showcase the validity, efficiency, and applicability of the QPEM, from low- to high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept evolutionary semigroups on path spaces, generalizing the notion of transition semigroups to possibly non-Markovian stochastic processes. We study the basic properties of evolutionary semigroups and, in particular, prove that they always arise as the composition of the shift semigroup and a single operator called the expectation operator of the semigroup. We also prove that the transition semigroup of a Markov process can always be extended to an evolutionary semigroup on the path space whenever the Markov process can be realized with the appropriate path regularity. As first examples of evolutionary semigroups associated to non-Markovian processes, we discuss deterministic evolution equations and stochastic flows driven by L\'evy processes. The latter in particular include certain stochastic delay equations.</description>

      <title>Phenotypic plasticity trade-offs in an age-structured model of bacterial growth under stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under low concentrations of antibiotics causing DNA damage, \textit{Escherichia coli} bacteria can trigger stochastically a stress response known as the SOS response. While the expression of this stress response can make individual cells transiently able to overcome antibiotic treatment, it can also delay cell division, thus impacting the whole population's ability to grow and survive. In order to study the trade-offs that emerge from this phenomenon, we propose a bi-type age-structured population model that captures the phenotypic plasticity observed in the stress response. Individuals can belong to two types: either a fast-dividing but prone to death ``vulnerable'' type, or a slow-dividing but ``tolerant'' type. We study the survival probability of the population issued from a single cell as well as the population growth rate in constant and periodic environments. We show that the sensitivity of these two different notions of fitness with respect to the parameters describing the phenotypic plasticity differs between the stochastic approach (survival probability) and the deterministic approach (population growth rate). Moreover, under a more realistic configuration of periodic stress, our results indicate that optimal population growth can only be achieved through fine-tuning simultaneously both the induction of the stress response and the repair efficiency of the damage caused by the antibiotic.</description>

      <title>Confined Poisson extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper follows on from our previous work, where we introduced the notion of \emph{confined extensions}, and our purpose is to widen the context in which such extensions appear. We do so in the setup of Poisson suspensions: we take a $\sigma$-finite measure-preserving dynamical system $(X, \mu, T)$ and a compact extension $(X \times G, \mu \otimes m_G, T_\phi)$, then we consider the corresponding Poisson extension $((X \times G)^*, (\mu \otimes m_G)^*, (T_\phi)_*) \overset{}{\to} (X^*, \mu^*, T_*)$. Our results give two different conditions under which that extension is confined. Finally, to show that those conditions are not void, we give an example of a system $(X, \mu, T)$ and a cocycle $\phi$ so that the compact extension $(X \times G, \mu \otimes m_G, T_\phi)$ has an infinite ergodic index.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks are referred to as quantum analogues to random walks in mathematics. They have been studied as quantum algorithms in quantum information for quantum computers. There are two types of quantum walks. One is the discrete-time quantum walk and the other is the continuous-time quantum walk. We study a continuous-time quantum walk on the half line and challenge to find a limit theorem for it in this paper. As a result, approximate behavior of the quantum walker is revealed after the system of quantum walk gets updated in long time.</description>

      <title>Moderate Deviations of Triangle Counts in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Random Graph $G(n,m)$: The Lower Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $N_{\triangle}(G)$ be the number of triangles in a graph $G$. In [14] and [25] (respectively) the following bounds were proved on the lower tail behaviour of triangle counts in the dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G_m\sim G(n,m)$:
  \[ \mathbb{P}\big(N_{\triangle}(G_m) \, &lt; \, (1-\delta)\mathbb{E}[N_{\triangle}(G_m)]\big) \,=\,
  \exp\left(-\Theta\left(\delta^2n^3\right)\right) \qquad \text{if $n^{-3/2}\ll \delta\ll n^{-1}$} \] and \[
  \mathbb{P}\big(N_{\triangle}(G_m) \, &lt; \, (1-\delta)\mathbb{E}[N_{\triangle}(G_m)]\big) \,=\,
  \exp\left(-\Theta(\delta^{2/3}n^2) \right) \qquad \text{if $n^{-3/4} \ll \delta \ll 1$.}
  \]
  Neeman, Radin and Sadun [25] also conjectured that the probability should be of the form $\exp\left(-\Theta\left(\delta^2n^3\right)\right)$ in the "missing interval" $n^{-1}\ll \delta\ll n^{-3/4}$. We prove this conjecture.
  As part of our proof we also prove that some random graph statistics, related to degrees and codegrees, are normally distributed with high probability.</description>

      <title>Optimization of inventory and capacity in large-scale assembly systems using extreme-value theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.09189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-tech systems are typically produced in two stages: 1) Production of components using specialized equipment and staff; 2) System assembly/integration. Component production capacity is subject to fluctuations, causing a high risk of shortages of at least one component, which results in costly delays. Companies hedge this risk by strategic investments in excess production capacity and in buffer inventories of components. To optimize these, it is crucial to characterize the relation between component shortage risk and capacity and inventory investments. We suppose that component production capacity and produce demand are normally distributed over finite time intervals, and we accordingly model the production system as a symmetric fork-join queueing network with $N$ statistically identical queues with a common arrival process and independent service processes. Assuming a symmetric cost structure, we subsequently apply extreme value theory to gain analytic insights into this optimization problem. We derive several new results for this queueing network, notably that the scaled maximum of $N$ steady-state queue lengths converges in distribution to a Gaussian random variable. These results translate into asymptotically optimal methods to dimension the system. Tests on a range of problems reveal that these methods typically work well for systems of moderate size.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the local times of the self-repelling random walk with directed edges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2008, T\'oth and Vet\H{o} defined the self-repelling random walk with directed edges as a non-Markovian random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$: in this model, the probability that the walk moves from a point of $\mathbb{Z}$ to a given neighbor depends on the number of previous crossings of the directed edge from the initial point to the target, called the local time of the edge. They found this model had a very peculiar behavior, as the process formed by the local times of all the edges, evaluated at a stopping time of a certain type and suitably renormalized, converges to a deterministic process, instead of a random one as in similar models. In this work, we study the fluctuations of the local times process around its deterministic limit, about which nothing was previously known. We prove that these fluctuations converge in the Skorohod $M_1$ topology, as well as in the uniform topology away from the discontinuities of the limit, but not in the most classical Skorohod topology. We also prove the convergence of the fluctuations of the aforementioned stopping times.</description>

      <title>Diffusion approximation of critical controlled multi-type branching processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Branching processes form an important family of stochastic processes that have been successfully applied in many fields. In this paper, we focus our attention on controlled multi-type branching processes (CMBPs). A Feller-type diffusion approximation is derived for some critical CMBPs. Namely, we consider a sequence of appropriately scaled random step functions formed from a critical CMBP with control distributions having expectations that satisfy a kind of linearity assumption. It is proved that such a sequence converges weakly toward a squared Bessel process supported by a ray determined by an eigenvector of a matrix related to the offspring mean matrix and the control distributions of the branching process in question. As applications, among others, we derive Feller-type diffusion approximations of critical, primitive multi-type branching processes with immigration and some two-sex branching processes. We also describe the asymptotic behaviour of the relative frequencies of distinct types of individuals for critical CMBPs.</description>

      <title>Tournaments and random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationship between tournaments and random walks. This connection was observed by Moser, who conjectured that the number of score sequences $S_n\sim C4^n/n^{5/2}$. Winston and Kleitman came close to finding the correct order of $S_n$. Building on this, and subsequent works by Tak\'acs, Kim and Pittel confirmed that $S_n=\Theta(4^n/n^{5/2})$.
  In this work, we verify Moser's conjecture, using limit theory for integrated random walk bridges. Moreover, we show that $C$ can be described in terms of random walks. Combining this with a recent proof and alternative, number-theoretic description of $C$ by the second author, we obtain an analogue of Louchard's formula, for the Laplace transform of the squared Brownian excursion/Airy area measure. Finally, we describe the scaling limit of random score sequences, in terms of the Kolmogorov excursions, studied recently by B\"{a}r, Duraj and Wachtel.
  Our results can also be interpreted as answering questions related to a class of random polymers, which began with influential work of Sina\u{i}. From this point of view, our methods yield the precise asymptotics of a persistence probability, related to the pinning/wetting models from statistical physics, that was estimated up to constants by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, as conjectured by Caravenna and Deuschel.</description>

We find the precise asymptotics of these probabilities, and describe their combinatorics, using limit theory for infinitely divisible distributions, and the number-theoretic subset counting formulas of von Sterneck from the early 1900s. Our results sharpen estimates by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, and respond to a conjecture of Caravenna and Deuschel, which arose in their study of the pinning/wetting models, for random linear chains exhibiting entropic repulsion. Our key combinatorial result is an analogue of Sparre Andersen's classical formula.</description>

      <title>A logical limit law for $231$-avoiding permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the class of 231-avoiding permutations satisfies a logical limit law, i.e. that for any first-order sentence $\Psi$, in the language of two total orders, the probability $p_{n,\Psi}$ that a uniform random 231-avoiding permutation of size $n$ satisfies $\Psi$ admits a limit as $n$ is large. Moreover, we establish two further results about the behavior and value of $p_{n,\Psi}$: (i) it is either bounded away from $0$, or decays exponentially fast; (ii) the set of possible limits is dense in $[0,1]$. Our tools come mainly from analytic combinatorics and singularity analysis.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium with Heterogeneous Information Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a continuous time economy where throughout time, insiders receive private signals regarding the risky assets' terminal payoff. We prove existence of a partial communication equilibrium where, at each private signal time, the public receives a signal of the same form as the associated insider, but of lower quality. This causes a jump in both the public information flow and equilibrium asset price. The resultant markets, while complete between each jump time, are incomplete over each jump. After establishing equilibrium for a finite number of private signal times, we consider the limit as the private signals become more and more frequent. Under appropriate scaling we prove convergence of the public filtration to the natural filtration generated by both the fundamental factor process $X$ and a continuous time process $J$ taking the form $J_t = X_1 + Y_t$ where $X_1$ is the terminal payoff and $Y$ an independent Gaussian process. This coincides with the filtration considered in 'Additional Utility of Insiders with Imperfect Dynamical Information' (Corcuera, et al. Finance &amp; Stochastics 2004). However, while therein the filtration was exogenously assumed to be that of an insider who observes a private signal flow, here it arises endogenously as the public filtration when there are a large number of insiders receiving signals throughout time.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Gaussian fields in noisy quantum chaotic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long time Schr\"odinger evolution of Lagrangian states $f_h$ on a compact Riemannian manifold $(X,g)$ of negative sectional curvature. We consider two models of semiclassical random Schr\"odinger operators $P_h^\alpha=-h^2\Delta_g +h^\alpha Q_\omega$, $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, where the semiclassical Laplace-Beltrami operator $-h^2\Delta_g$ on $X$ is subject to a small random perturbation $h^\alpha Q_\omega$ given by either a random potential or a random pseudo-differential operator. Here, the potential or the symbol of $Q_\omega$ is bounded, but oscillates and decorrelates at scale $h^{\beta}$, $0&lt; \beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}$. We prove a quantitative result that, under appropriate conditions on $\alpha,\beta$, in probability with respect to $\omega$ the long time propagation $$\mathrm{e}^{\frac{i}{h}t_h P_h^\alpha } f_h, \quad o(|\log h|)=t_h\to\infty, ~~h\to 0,$$ rescaled to the local scale of $h$ around a uniformly at random chosen point $x_0$ on $X$, converges in law to an isotropic stationary monochromatic Gaussian field -- the Berry Gaussian field. We also provide and $\omega$-almost sure version of this convergence along sufficiently fast decaying subsequences $h_j\to 0$.</description>

      <title>The functional volume product under heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the functional volume product for even functions is monotone increasing along the Fokker--Planck heat flow. This in particular yields a new proof of the functional Blaschke--Santal\'{o} inequality by K. Ball and also Artstein-Avidan--Klartag--Milman in the even case.
  This result is the consequence of a new understanding of the regularizing property of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. That is, we establish an improvement of Borell's reverse hypercontractivity inequality for even functions and identify the sharp range of the admissible exponents. As another consequence of successfully identifying the sharp range for the inequality, we derive the sharp $L^p$-$L^q$ inequality for the Laplace transform for even functions. The best constant of the inequality is attained by centered Gaussians, and thus this provides an analogous result to Beckner's sharp Hausdorff--Young inequality.
  Our technical novelty in the proof is the use of the Brascamp--Lieb inequality for log-concave measures and Cram\'{e}r--Rao's inequality in this context.</description>

      <title>Optimal consumption and investment under relative performance criteria with Epstein-Zin utility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the strategic interaction of traders in a continuous-time financial market with Epstein-Zin-type recursive intertemporal preferences and performance concerns. We derive explicitly an equilibrium for the finite player and the mean-field version of the game, based on a study of geometric backward stochastic differential equations of Bernoulli type that describe the best replies of traders. Our results show that Epstein-Zin preferences can lead to substantially different equilibrium behavior.</description>

      <title>An SEIR network epidemic model with manual and digital contact tracing allowing delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an SEIR epidemic model on a network also allowing random contacts, where recovered individuals could either recover naturally or be diagnosed. Upon diagnosis, manual contact tracing is triggered such that each infected network contact is reported, tested and isolated with some probability and after a random delay. Additionally, digital tracing (based on a tracing app) is triggered if the diagnosed individual is an app-user, and then all of its app-using infectees are immediately notified and isolated. The early phase of the epidemic with manual and/or digital tracing is approximated by different multi-type branching processes, and three respective reproduction numbers are derived. The effectiveness of both contact tracing mechanisms is numerically quantified through the reduction of the reproduction number. This shows that app-using fraction plays an essential role in the overall effectiveness of contact tracing. The relative effectiveness of manual tracing compared to digital tracing increases if: more of the transmission occurs on the network, when the tracing delay is shortened, and when the network degree distribution is heavy-tailed. For realistic values, the combined tracing case can reduce $R_0$ by $20-30\%$, so other preventive measures are needed to reduce the reproduction number down to $1.2-1.4$ for contact tracing to make it successful in avoiding big outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Analysis of singular subspaces under random perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of singular vector and singular subspace perturbations in the context of the signal plus random Gaussian noise matrix model. Assuming a low-rank signal matrix, we extend the Davis-Kahan-Wedin theorem in a fully generalized manner, applicable to any unitarily invariant matrix norm, extending previous results of O'Rourke, Vu and the author. We also obtain the fine-grained results, which encompass the $\ell_\infty$ analysis of singular vectors, the $\ell_{2, \infty}$ analysis of singular subspaces, as well as the exploration of linear and bilinear functions related to the singular vectors. Moreover, we explore the practical implications of these findings, in the context of the Gaussian mixture model and the submatrix localization problem.</description>
